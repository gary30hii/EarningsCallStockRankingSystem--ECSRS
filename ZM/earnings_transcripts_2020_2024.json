At this time, I would like to turn the floor over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Matt. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom\u2019s Earnings Webinar for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2020. Joining me today will be Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan; and Zoom\u2019s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page on the Zoom.com website. Also, on this page, you\u2019ll be able to find a copy of today\u2019s prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about future financial performance and other future events or trends, including guidance. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that can affect our performance and financial results and which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today\u2019s earnings press release and our latest 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today\u2019s webinar. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Tom. Thank you and welcome everyone joining us on the Zoom Video webinar. At Zoom, we strive to empower our customers to accomplish more with our video-first unified communications platform. Our success toward achieving this goal is evident in our results with the fourth quarter capping off a strong year for Zoom, our first year as a public company. Kelly will discuss our Q4 results and outlook in detail in a moment, so let me give you a few key highlights for the full year. For FY20, we delivered a unique combination of high revenue, profitability and a free cash flow growth. Revenue grew 88% to $623 million and we exited Q4 at an annualized run rate of $0.75 billion. We achieved non-GAAP operating margin of 14.2%, up over 900 basis points year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $114 million for the full year, up 397% year-over-year. This is our 4th straight year of positive free cash flow and non-GAAP operating income. Our customer metrics were also impressive for FY20, including 86% growth year-over-year for customers with $100,000 of trailing twelve months revenue. We also recently celebrated the one year anniversary of the launch of Zoom Phone, a key component of the Zoom unified communications platform that has significantly expanded our TAM. Zoom Phone had an incredible start and we are excited about the continued momentum of the offering. Here are just a few of the key metrics to demonstrate some of the Zoom Phone accomplishments we had this past year: First, we are grateful to have existing customers who trust us and new customers who have looked to Zoom Phone to resolve their telephone challenges. These factors enabled us to close Zoom Phone deals with approximately 2,900 customers who have more than 10 employees. Second, we exited the year with a run rate of 230 million Zoom Phone minutes. Zoom Phone is a great opportunity to expand our footprint with existing customers and drive new logos for companies looking to modernize away from legacy PBX systems. Now let me discuss a few of our happy customers. We are thrilled to welcome Johnson and Johnson, the world\u2019s largest and most broadly-based health care company, to the Zoom family. We are grateful that Johnson and Johnson chose Zoom to help modernize and consolidate on a unified communications platform with approximately 60,000 Zoom meeting users. As a global company they wanted a solution that would enable them to communicate reliably around the world including growing regions in Asia. Thank you Johnson and Johnson. I also want to thank VMware for trusting Zoom. VMware has been providing all employees, globally, access to Zoom meetings and digital workspace, and will soon utilize a large deployment of Zoom Phone. The easy, single sign-on access to Zoom from any device is enabled to leverage the VMware Workspace ONE platform, allowing employees to access all the applications they need from their device of choice while ensuring security and compliance. Together with Zoom, VMware Workspace ONE helps businesses support their distributed workforces by enabling a remote-first culture. Thank you VMware. Moving to a few recent business highlights: First, in the 2020 Gartner Peer Insights Customers\u2019 Choice Award for Meeting Solutions, Zoom received the top overall rating in the \u201cVoice of the Customer\u201d category. Zoom was the only company to achieve Customers\u2019 Choice Awards for meeting solutions serving all listed regions, company sizes, and industry verticals. Second, Okta published their annual Businesses @ Work 2020 Report, a premier study of how organizations and people are using technology in the enterprise. The report highlighted Zoom as a preferred video application, posting 876% growth in the Okta network over the past 3 years! Zoom is the only company to earn the distinction of being both the fastest growing and most popular app. Third, we announced an expansion of our Global Channel Partner Program to add new partnerships with industry-leading Master Agents for Zoom Phone. Fourth, Caring for our community is a core value for Zoom and we are conscious of our impact on the environment. We proudly announced our top ten Green Leader customers, who were estimated to avoid the most carbon dioxide emissions by replacing in-person meetings with Zoom video meetings. In a 90 day period, the top ten customers were estimated to have avoided the equivalent of the annual carbon dioxide emissions of 149,000 cars. Before turning the webinar over to Kelly, I\u2019d also like to address the global impact we are seeing from the coronavirus. While this tragic situation is very fluid, Zoom is focused on using our resources to help alleviate some of the disruption and communication challenges as an alternative to in-person meetings for our employees, customers and community I am happy to report that all of our employees in the affected areas are healthy. Given the recent emergence and growing number of coronavirus cases in the United States, we have directed our Headquarter employees to work from home, unless there is a business-critical need for them to be in the office. We\u2019re taking this step out of abundance of caution. Zoom is doing everything we can, especially for global educational institutions, to provide resources and support our customers and those navigating the coronavirus outbreak, including: We are proactively monitoring capacity globally to ensure maximum reliability amid usage increases. In China, we have removed the 40 minute limit on free meetings. And we are providing informational sessions and on-demand resources so anyone can learn how to use the Zoom platform with ease. With the reliability of our high quality video platform, we have seen a large increase in the number of free users, meeting minutes and new video use cases. For instance, in China, healthcare workers under stressful conditions in affected areas are able to connect live on video with therapists. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank the over 2,500 Zoom employees who are building Zoom into a great company through caring for our customers, community, company, teammates, and themselves. As we remain focused on creating a culture built around happiness and caring, I know we will position Zoom for future success. With that, let me turn things over to Kelly.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric, and hello everyone. Let me start by reviewing our financial results for Q4, then discussing our outlook for Q1 and the full year of FY21. As Eric said, Q4 was a strong end to the year. We delivered another amazing quarter with continued traction for all offerings across all major geographies. For Q4 specifically, total revenue grew 78% year-over-year, to $188 million. This top line result exceeded the high-end of our guidance range by $12 million due to our strong sales execution in the quarter. We delivered our Zoom Meetings, Rooms and Phone solutions to new accounts while driving major expansions with existing customers. For the quarter, new customers accounted for approximately 59% of our year-over-year growth in subscription revenue while the remaining 41% was due to additional purchases from existing customers. Now, let me share some of the key customer metrics for Q4: We added approximately 7,800 customers with more than 10 employees quarter-over-quarter and exited Q4 with 81,900 customers. This is an increase of 31,100 new customers, or 61% year-over-year. Customers with more than 10 employees represented approximately 80% of revenue in FY20, compared to approximately 78% in the prior fiscal year. Our continued expansion in the up-market resulted in 641 customers with more than $100,000 in trailing twelve months revenue, up 86% year-over-year. This is an increase of 95 customers, a record number of adds in a quarter. The high level of satisfaction and trust customers have in Zoom was evident in our net dollar expansion rate that was over 130% for the seventh consecutive quarter and our Net Promoter Score which remained above 70 in Q4. Next, international expansion outpaced the high rate of growth in Americas revenue. In Q4, our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew 84% year-over-year and represented approximately 20% of revenue. Revenue from the Americas was up 77% year-over-year and represented approximately 80% of revenue. International expansion will continue to be one of our key growth initiatives in FY21 and beyond. Now turning to profitability. Once again, we were net income profitable from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives, but I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and related share-based equity taxes. Non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter was 84.2%, compared to 82.1% in Q4 last year and 82.9% last quarter. This result was driven by the strong sales execution in the quarter and lower seasonal audio usage in Q4 due to the extended holiday season. Due to the coronavirus, we have already seen significant usage of our platform and accordingly we will expand our capacity to meet the increased demands of both paid and free users. For FY21, we believe our gross margins will be at the lower end of our long term target of 80% to 82%. R&D expense in Q4 was approximately $16 million, up 60% year-over-year. As a percent of total revenue, R&D was 9%, which was slightly lower than Q4 last year. In FY21, we plan to continue investing in our highly efficient R&D model to drive innovation through adding engineering talent, especially in the first half of the year. Sales and marketing expense for Q4 was $84 million. This reflects an increase of 57% or $30 million dollars over last year with investments to drive further growth. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing was 45%, lower than Q4 last year due to continued efficiency gains in marketing combined with slightly slower than expected sales hiring and the higher than forecasted revenue. We look to increase the pace of hiring in the up-market and internationally in FY21 with additional resources being added to recruiting. G&A expense in Q4 was $20 million, up 49% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 11% of total revenue, benefiting from efficiencies as we scale our administrative functions and lower our accrual for telco taxes. Non-GAAP operating income was $38 million, translating to a 20.4% non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter. This compares to Q4 last year\u2019s result of $10 million and 9.3% margin. The higher revenue plus expense efficiencies across all areas were the main drivers of this additional profit. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $0.15, on approximately 293 million of non-GAAP, weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.08 cents higher than our guidance and $0.11 cents higher than Q4 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $231 million, up 83% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, totaled approximately $604 million, up 94% from $312 million last year. We expect to recognize approximately 62% or $375 million of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 67% or $208 million in Q4 last year. This is a result of the mix shift between current RPO which grew 81% year-over-year, while non-current RPO grew 120% year-over-year as we closed longer term deals. The RPO results also reflect some expected seasonality benefits in Q4 due to our semi-annual quotas in the up-market segment of our business. We ended Q4 with approximately $855 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. In Q4, operating cash flow was $37 million, up from $16 million or 129% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $27 million, up from $6 million or 368% year-over-year. As we previously discussed, these results reflect the use of cash for the purchase of shares via the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Starting in FY21, we expect the cadence of benefits from contributions to the ESPP to occur in Q1 and Q3 and net outflows from purchases to occur in Q2 and Q4. Now turning to guidance, we are pleased to provide a strong outlook for the full year FY21 based on our view of the current business environment, our ability to gain market share and with the momentum we built in FY20. For the full year of FY21, we expect revenue to be in the range of $905 million to $915 million, which would be approximately 45% to 47% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.45 for the full year FY21, based on approximately 301 million shares outstanding. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $199 million to $201 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $25 million to $27 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.10 based on approximately 297 million shares outstanding. In closing, we executed very well and are proud of the results we delivered in our first year as a public company. Our high growth outlook at this scale is truly unique. Given our ROI-focused business model, we continue to deliver a rare combination of strong profitability and free cash flow margins along with our top line growth. I would also like to thank the entire Zoom team for their hard work this past year and look forward to achieving additional market share gains and growth as we deliver happiness to our customers with our unified communications platform. With that, let's open it up for questions. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue-up our first question.\nOperator: Our first question is from Nikolay Beliov from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nNikolay Beliov: Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on solid results here. And I just wanted to thank a Zoom for playing an important role in dealing with the tragedy with this virus. My first question is for Eric. This viral situation -- this virus tragedy, do you feel like it's elevating the customer conversations? And it's leading to better appreciation of your business model. Do you think like maybe a permanent elevation or spending intentions or it's a temporary thing. And question for you, Kelly, did you see impact from the virus in Q4 results maybe in billings and RPO and how did you incorporate any potential positive impact on the business in the guidance?\nEric Yuan: Nikolay, that's good question. First of all, I liked your voice and background, where are you now?\nNikolay Beliov: You don't want to know where I'm now.\nEric Yuan: I think a first of all, I don't think that's temporary. The reason why is, I mean, in terms of experience about, they using the video conference like Zoom. Look at a company as a sitting commodity like InVision, Zapier, or Gitlab was great companies, they do not have a single physical office. You really understand, how do we enable remote workers to work together? However, if you look at conference out, a part of the ward or maybe you know, other side of California, quite often we needed help. We knew in the future of a communication union of the enable video and as we needed to explain that. But given this coronavirus, I think the over the night almost everybody read and understand, they needed a tool like this. This will dramatically change the landscape. I should believe in the future, everyone will take on to video for the remote workers for the collaboration.\nKelly Steckelberg: In terms of our results in Slide 4, Q4, we did not see any impact directly related to coronavirus and as a reminder we have definitely seen an up tick in usage. But a lot of that is on the free side. So it's very early to tell whether or not that's going to convert long-term into paying customers. As we mentioned, we are seeing impact and if continue to build capacity to ensure that we can support this increased usage. So we are seeing impact on our gross margins, which is why we're guiding you towards the lower end of our range for next year.\nEric Yuan: By the way, I ever mentioned this to some of my friends. If I start over the company, well, I'm not going to have a single physical office. A lot of people as I mentioned, are you crazy? Now realize that's reality now.\nOperator: Next question is from Bhavan Suri with William Blair.\nBhavan Suri: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I want to touch a little bit on the vertical sales effort. You've talked a lot, Eric, about sort of the adoption of Zoom or taking hold on a vertical by vertical basis. Just strategies, you think about the verticals strategy on the sales force that go to market and then the applications you are integrating. How do you think about that given sort of the increasing presence enterprise?\nEric Yuan: Yes. That's a good question. So when we started, we do not know which vertical market we are going to focus on. And fortunately, we saw quite a few high end customers who deployed Zoom. Stanford started its group was our first customer. And that's why our first vertical market is high-ed. And several years ago, we found a great use case which is healthcare customers because they are looking for a solution because we target kind of medicine, [indiscernible] because there's no good solution and here they found Zoom and we also keep our compliance, the product is first and its Epic, I think that's very, very important vertical market. Also at the same time, we also, last year we got a federal certificate. We also expanded into the public sector market by focusing on enterprise, healthcare, public sectors and also I think later last year we also expanded into the financial institutions. I think all of those vertical market, use case is a little bit different, but our functionality, our feature and flexibility and truly amazing.\nBhavan Suri: That's helpful. And I wanted to touch a little bit more sort of then strategically, if we could take a step back. We've talked a lot about convergence and you've discussed this in the past, you've discussed in calls, but it's convergence, video, voice, you've talked about that. We know collaboration is a piece and again, your partner there. But as you think about this idea of remote, disconnected people, all of it ties into collaboration. How do we communicate, how do we collaborate in word documents, PowerPoints, whatever you're using and you think about Zoom play safe video sure there is Zoom Phone. But if I have to fast forward, do you think ultimately that collaboration space converges? And where'd you guys end up sitting in terms of the content piece? I'd love to understand how you think about the content part of the collaboration piece not video and voice content obviously, but we're talking about the data piece. How do you think about that? And I know you're going to say partnership but I'm talking 10 years out as opposed to say the near term.\nEric Yuan: I think for the foreseeable future and video and voice, unified communications, that's a huge market, right, for this billion dollars market. I think we are going to be very busy like especially for enterprise migrate to the cloud, video voice will be converted into web service. We are going to laser focus on video and voice. But, at the same time , we also build a platform, our marketplace there are already over 200 applications. We like to integrate with other collaboration vendors with focusing on the content, like Dropbox and Box, like Okat or Max Soft. I think that's the way. While customer, they are looking for the best of breed of service, right, with intercoms video and voice, I think that's our game.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty: So with the surging free users, are you actually developing programs that will work on conversion of these potentially temporary free users into permanent paid users?\nEric Yuan: Yes. That's a good question. First of all, we all feel sorry about those who have suffered from coronavirus in China and all over the world. We're super grateful to those doctors for having the war to deal with coronavirus. I think that's why, we really focus on how to have those companies, those workers to connect, because in this critical time, I want to say empathy, humanity and support for each other is more important, then revenue, then growth. At this moment, we are laser focused on offering the best of service to have the people in the world. We even never thought about it, monetize because that's not our focus. That's not important. If you truly care about the customers, truly deliver value to the word, I think all of those will follow in the future.\nSterling Auty: Got it. And then one follow-up on Zoom Phone. You talked about almost 3000 Zoom Phone customers. Where are you finding the sweet spot in terms of the size of the companies that are really gravitating towards, moving over to Zoom Phone. You mentioned VMware in your prepared remarks, but is there a sweet spot for where Zoom Phone is heading?\nEric Yuan: I think that in my view, I feel everybody is in the sweet spot now. So because you look at our installed base, from SMB all the way optical unified customers, we may talk about Zoom phone, after they test that they say, wow, that's exactly what they are looking for. We see the greater costumer adoption from SAP customer, Zoom Phone VMR as well because experience is very different, right? If you look at all other phone systems, no matter on-prem phone system or cloud-based phone system. Ultimately, you are just kind of make a phone call. While studying, I call your phone number, we come when we talk. We really cannot go ahead and say ours. With Zoom Phone, it is very different. One more click I can see you, I can share the content. That's a totally different architecture. That's why if you look at our install base after tests, our solutions really like our experience. No any other solutions can match that experience.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nKelly Steckelberg: Matt, she is on mute still.\nOperator: Hey Meta.\nMeta Marshall: You put out some announcements over the past couple of days on additional geographies as far as Zoom phone, just wanted to see whether we should consider you guys covered in the major regions you'd like to be deployed in as far as Zoom phone reach for now. And then, maybe Kelly you address kind of the, the growth margin impacts should be mostly from kind of capacity increases from some of the free usage right now. But should we consider some of that gross margin impact from Zoom Phone adoption as well as? That's it for me.Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So yes, we're super excited that we added 11 new countries into GA for Zoom Phone taking us to 18 total countries that were GA and additional 25 in beta. So we're getting close to, I think the coverage that the goal is to be in close to 50 countries by the end of this year, which is really what we're striving for. And a couple of key markets like India and China, we're still continuing to work on. And then in terms of the gross margin impact, no, we really haven't seen impact from Zoom Phone as we talked about. It's still small relative to the overall usage that it's not having an impact on the gross margins. It's really coming from the increase that we're seeing globally in terms of -- in the last month or so related mostly to coronavirus.\nOperator: Our next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs.\nHeather Bellini: I just wanted to follow up on Zoom Phone. I mean in a really short period of time, you've obviously had some great success with that rollout. Eric, knowing that you're constantly listening to customer feedback, what are the top R&D priorities for Zoom Phone, if you look ahead over the next 12 months? And also do you see any benefit on the horizon by Avaya's decision to partner with Ring Central instead of kind of going down their own path. So as those customers look to migrate, do you see an opportunity there? Thank you so much.\nEric Yuan: Heather, thank you. I know you are probably traveling. So next time we can see you and that's a good question. So in terms of Zoom Phone effort, we don't assume that's brand new application possibly maybe with a platform. The first application that is built upon a platform is to do conference. The second obligation is a Zoom Phone. So, many of us share lots of the components, when we build the Zoom Phone system, having said that, there are some features missing and also international coverage as well. We are making very, very good progress as Kelly just shared. In terms of this year, we are adding a little bit more features like recently we can also SMS, the beta, right? And also add a lot of features. All those features, I do know things, I could assess, really just a partition level of work. The harder part already done, right? That's why we have a high confidence we can deliver a much better solution than any of our potential competitors. So regarding the Avaya-Ring Center deal, I think from our perspective, we really focus on our installed base focus on video and voice convergence. That's the kind of our region. And today looking at some of the customer take VMware, right? They deployed on-premise solutions and some other costumers also deployed maybe the on-prem Avaya solutions. When they evaluate which club has PBX solution to go. If they do the test, they will now that. Zoom experience is better. It's better than any other club as PBX vendors, we have high confidence as long as customers try our solutions. That's a solution to go.\nOperator: Our next question is Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Brad, you are unmuted.\nBrad Zelnick: I don't know if you guys can see me, but it was nice to see you. Fantastic, great. So, congrats on all the success thus far with phone. We've seen some of your competitors really leverage the channel to drive success and I was wondering how should we think about your willingness to do the same?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So we're really excited to announce that we just yesterday I guess launched our master agent program for phones specifically and we've signed up two big partners in Mphasis and Avant. And the more formal launch will be next week at the channel conference. Yes. Thank you.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you, Kelly. And maybe just to follow up on that expansion, it remains above 130%, but based on our math, it would seem to be the lowest level of expansion that we've seen thus far. How much of the deceleration is due to large lands and how should we think about expansion rates from here?\nKelly Steckelberg: So there's a couple of things that contribute to our net dollar expansion rate. It's land and expand as you touched on as well as Zoom Phone. So we really see great opportunity for that number to be influenced by Zoom Phone as well as land-and-expand is a critical part. I mean it does vary quarter-over-quarter depending as you just indicated on the size of the initial deals. But we're confident for the long term that it'll stay at about 130.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Roderick with Stifel.\nTom Roderick: Hi everyone. Thank you for having me on. Thanks for taking my question. So Eric, apologize, I jumped over and I think you were talking about this right as I jumped over, but obviously your customers are very excited to be able to use Zoom during a challenging time. At the same time, obviously you have a pretty nice sized workforce over there in China as well. And I'd love to hear just a little bit more about, how are you're able to still communicate what your procedures are with your R&D staff? And as you talk about building up more R&D dollars in the year 2020, help us understand where geographically you're thinking about that in spite of all of the challenges we're facing globally right now with the coronavirus taking place. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Good question. So if you look at our R&D resources, the core R&D here, our Headquarter in San Jose. And we also have a team in China and of course, I met at a WebEx engineer team before. I'm very familiar with that process, how to manage the offshore team. And inside of that actually we are using Zoom Video every day. So we need every engineer's anytime, anywhere that can work for sure have a secured process. And we are already familiar with remote working, practice for long, long time. During the coronavirus, a lot of other business they have to work in a home. I think quite often we got to -- really don't know how to do that or we know how. That's why, over the past several weeks, most of them already back to work. Over the past several weeks when they went back to home to work, there's no any impact whatsoever because they already know how to do that. And here we also did not see any impact. We're still working together with our team for sure we all know how to use a Zoom. I think the impact to us is a very minimum. And for us, this year, I know next two years I think we're going to hire more and more resources here. For the new services, a lot of artificial intelligence features and the core capabilities, of course, the core IP R&D is still developer here because that's why we further expand our R&D team here in our headquarter this year and also positive for the future as well.\nTom Roderick: Great. And a quick follow-up for you, Eric, just thinking about, you've been doing this a long time, you've seen a number of these sort of disruptive moments in tech. This is clearly a disruptive moment in the global economy. When you think about your conversations with your biggest customers out there, how were they talking about the way that they want to expand with their key partners over the next one or two or three years? And do you think of this as an opportunity to really sort of shift some of those into a big digital transformation as they sort of reevaluate how they spend their money coming out of the back end of this whole situation?\nEric Yuan: Yes. That's a good question. So by the way, today we also have our Annual Analyst meetings as well. And in addition to talking with our customers, I think [indiscernible], I think this is a very critical moment. So meaning, I think the more the more benefits, we are going to leverage the video conferencing service like Zoom, it drive our productivity, no matter where those employees are, they still want to get a job done. However, when it comes from video conferencing, the key is that you have to make it work anytime, anywhere with any device. Otherwise they're not going to use it. And because of this coronavirus, a lot of businesses have removed employees, after they tried Zoom first time, a lot of users first time try Zoom, they say, wow, it's just works. I think because of that, I think this is a very exciting time in terms of how to further drive the video conferencing adoption. I think this is very sustainable.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pat Walravens with JMP.\nPat Walravens: So Eric, I mean, looking forward to having the COVID-19 result and when we get there, I was wondering if you could help us think a little bit about what the long-term opportunity is like for Zoom in China. And maybe just to put a couple ideas there. How might pricing be different? How might the competition be different and how might user behavior be different?\nEric Yuan: Yes, that's good question. So you're looking at our revenue, also the revenue from Asia and China included is relatively small, right? It's kind of still driven by North America and Europe and in Japan, Australia, I think because of this coronavirus, I think China realized, I think they didn't have more tools, not only Zoom, more and more the B2B tools to drive their productivity, used to be like seeing 10 people, right? You do not need to deploy HR tools, but now you really cannot have those 10 people anymore, they all went back to home. I think this will further boost the B2B SaaS application adoption in China, I have decided that video conferencing is a tool they all understand. We also have some local competitors, but the market is there, potential is big and also we're in the process of -- never going to source several options. To say which option is better because over the past several years, we really wanted to go to China market. However, I do not think the time is right. For now, I think its coming right, we needed to make sure we have a sustainable strategy to expand into China to have the local benefits there.\nPat Walravens: And if I could ask, since we're all starting to have to work from home remotely a lot more, you had like one or two key pointers you would give us, how to do it effectively? Does the camera have to be on all the time?\nEric Yuan: So first of all, I do not realize you are at home. I did not realize.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. That's the first one, is get a virtual background. That helps a lot.\nEric Yuan: I think that's pretty much actually, in terms of we have all the features built-in, right? And when you just clear on some features, you will see that like, I think sample, my favorite feature is a touch up my appearance. And also to see which background, a lot of features are built-in. And it was a small, like a breakout session as well. And a lot of which are to built-in the past several years. I think, finally, our customer realized, it's time to clear on all the features, we will build further.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan MacWilliams with Stephens. Ryan, you are unmuted.\nRyan MacWilliams: So how do you see the market trending for cloud voice pricing going forward? Is there a temptation on your end to reduce pricing for Zoom Phone? Especially given the fact some of your competitors have started offering their own video capabilities for free?\nKelly Steckelberg: Well, we believe that we were already very competitively priced from both Zoom Phone and Zoom Meetings perspective against the market. And we haven't seen price pressure beyond kind of the normal discounting that we typically do. And we feel really good about where we're sitting. The way that we historically brought value to our customers is by adding more and more features to both meetings and phone. And we will continue to do that approach across all of our product lines.\nEric Yuan: So in terms of -- a comment about some of the vendors offering the free video conferencing. I can tell you, it's very easy. It's extremely easy to build a very, very basic video conferencing solution with some open source. But, however, to have a global scale, very secure, reliable, five minute availability, it just works. It's extremely hard, right? I'm always already in this real-time collaboration base, almost 23 years. Today, you look at where we are now, there is still a lot of missing that are not done yet. I think free, no, I mean your customer, they want to use that service.\nRyan MacWilliams: Great. I just kind of to that point, with 230 million Zoom Phone voice minutes and video minutes also expanding with a Zoom Phone or zoom customer growth, how do you see the AI opportunity for Zoom to add features around transcription around this influx of usage?\nEric Yuan: So voice on a video is a same platform, but [indiscernible] quite often if you -- which already shared the same the platform encryption, right? We have encryption and process we are working on what a customer key, the improvements that based on the key offered by customers, but sometimes, voice is a little bit different. With Zoom we can offer very secured service. However, if you want to dial someone else, the several number or the PSV network, will go to the traditional PSV network as I've seen it is really hard because it's completely out of our control.\nOperator: Our next question is from Zane Chrane with Bernstein. Zane, you're unmuted. We will come back to Zane. The next question is from Will Power with Baird.\nWill Power: I guess first question is, as we think about the coronavirus impacts, any color you can provide in terms of the geographic spread of traffic, how much of the traffic increase was in China versus in other geographies. And I'd love to hear anything more on some of the more unique use cases you've seen.\nEric Yuan: I'm going to start. Feel free to tell me, Kelly. I think over the past several weeks, first of all, we see the very, very big job from users in China. And the good news, we have a very flexible, the banking architecture. We can auto scale our servers. That's why, within a several days and we added a lot of capacity. And really focus on the product, especially the customer there are very, very happy. And also afterwards you see like we see the usage, not the one with China, for Vietnam or Singapore or Japan all follow over the past several weeks. Essentially I think look at APAC almost the every country uses a lot. And last week, we see the uses from Europe and here as well, it's kind of take the print to see the use this job.\nKelly Steckelberg: I think in terms of use cases we talked about the doctors getting therapy. We also of course see lots of educational institutions that have stopped either study abroad programs or having all of their students study from home as well as we've seen a few of our customers here that have already moved to -- requiring their employees to work from home as well. And so we're seeing an increase in that sense.\nWill Power: In virtual events too.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. A lot of virtual events.\nEric Yuan: Why use case service not only we do offer the video, we also offer the video web in a platform. It's pretty powerful. And the sitting that we will have -- they have a -- since there are doctors, for a long time depression, anxiety and the [indiscernible] university number one in China also with some other psychologist, they use Zoom and to treat the doctors there, as it\u2019s a good use case and it really made those doctors in Wuhan very, very happy.\nWill Power: Okay. Then if I could just get one question in on Zoom Phone, as you look across the broader unified communication space. There seems to be increased interest with bundling contact center. I wonder if you look at your 2,900 customers, any comments as to how many you're taking contact center, how do you think about the partnership model there long-term versus having your platform.\nEric Yuan: Yes. You're right on. So we focused on our call video and voice capability in terms of cognitive center, I think it's very different market from our perspective. However, from a costumer perspective they would like to have [indiscernible] integration. That's why we are partner with Five9 and also Twilio and Genesys, specifically about Five9. Steve Rowe is great leader, really it's an collaboration, the two team worked together very well and like Zoom we also use our video conference -- Zoom phone system. We also deploy Five9 and the solution works very well. I think a huge opportunity between Zoom and Five9. So ultimately we wanted to partner with other contact centers solutions.\nOperator: Next question we are going back to Zane Chrane with Bernstein.\nZane Chrane: So I wanted to dig into the non-business customers a little bit. I know that only about 20% of your revenue at the time of IPO, but it's important group in some ways just because it had a much higher annualized churn rate than I think your business customers typically do. Can you give us a sense of what portion of the revenue non-business customers comprise now and what that should look like over the next couple of years?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. It's actually been really steady at that same 20% of revenue for FY20. I think over time as we continue to focus more and more on the up market, we'll see that overall percentage decrease, but it's been pretty steady and consistent over the last year.\nZane Chrane: And just a follow-up to that, have the renewal rates, the contract renewal rates either on a customer or dollar basis changed over the last year? I know you've talked about the net expansion rate, before including upsell and seat expansion, how should we think about the trend for just contract renewals?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. We haven't seen any trade changes. It's been pretty consistent. It's holding pretty steady.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with RBC.\nAlex Zukin: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on another very successful quarter. Maybe first for Eric, how important, particularly in the larger deal opportunities as you think about the future of work and the compression of that adoption curve given something like the coronavirus, how important from a go-to-market perspective and some of those larger deals, are your relationships with partners like Slack, like Dropbox that kind of enable your customers to create an entire experience around this area?\nEric Yuan: Yes. That's good question. I think, first of all, I'd like to take a step back into service. What's happening in part of that decision-making process for lot of invest? Because over the term of 10 or 20 years, nobody say, we couldn't find it. Today is very different. Almost the 50% of workforce is today here, I mean, annuals, right? And they've grown up along with a smartphone. And that's why, if you do not like your service, no matter what, they are not going to use your service. This is their habit, right? This is their experience. Having said that, I think land and expand influenced the by the bottom up users extremely critical, right? Quite often they already use the Dropbox. Already use a Slack. And they want to find out the best way to service, like we do in voice, also deploy Zoom. That's why we have very, very tight integration with Dropbox. Within Dropbox interface, you can log to Zoom. With the Slack, it also got to Zoom. I think that's a trend. Basically the service will drive the adoption, will truly deliver happiness to land customers.\nAlex Zukin: That's great. And then maybe Kelly one for you, if I think about current RPO and RPO, I think, we're looking at the current RPO bookings of 58%, compare that roughly to the 46% guide for the revenue growth next year. Help us bridge that a little bit. And then in the script you also mentioned some seasonality benefits to RPO from semi-annual quotas in kind of the up market segment. Can you maybe unpack that and explain that a little bit?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So just a quick reminder that RPO is not absolute directional metric for us due to -- there's a significant percentage of our customers who both buy and pay monthly so it doesn't correlate the way you would expect it to run other enterprise customers. And in terms of the seasonality, if you remember when we talked about this in Q3, we saw some seasonality in terms of it being somewhat flatter Q2 to Q3 and now we're seeing that benefit in Q4 due to the fact that our up market teams are on six months plans. And so what we see is, as it gets to the end of their six month plans and they have the opportunity obviously to overachieve and then go into accelerators that we see a typical linearity toward or seasonality towards the back half of their six month plan. And that's what you're seeing in some of that increase for the RPO for Q4.\nOperator: Our next question is from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo. Phil, I unmuted you. He just joined back in and we'll come back to you. Phil. Next question is from Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt. Ryan, you are unmuted.\nKelly Steckelberg: Ryan, do you have your phone on mute there?\nRyan Koontz: So, to look at your videos, seats, you're winning. Can you estimate the percentage that are defections from other platforms versus greenfield wins. And then in the broader picture, are you seeing changes in the competitive landscape and a given your increasing market leadership there?\nEric Yuan: I think if you look at alternative quarter, over the past several years. And Zoom is becoming the most of popular video conferencing application. Look at our customers, quite often, especially for large enterprise customers or medium size customers, we already deploy other solutions, but they did not use that we are open. And it's also the different experience. It's more like a web conferencing -- only conferencing and a Zoom is a true cloud -- video first solution. And that's why they all want to switch to Zoom. It's not like from web solution, other solution, I believe this is a totally different service. We are in a different category because more like a Tesla car and the other care, they are all cars, they are totally separated. They have been a category. That's why I think in from that perspective, I would say every customer, no matter which other solutions they are using today as a greenfield. That's our experienced.\nOperator: We're going to back to Phil Winslow. So our next question is from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.\nPhil Winslow: Just want to focus in on Zoom Phone. Obviously you guys continue to do great traction there. And I remember when you first launched it, you said, hey, wouldn't take a while to get some of these bigger just your customer wins and knock down. But it seems like you've done that. If we think about just sort of the functionality -- of the offering, is this for the 80(20) rule, we've got 80% of what you need to actually knock down some of these big accounts, and the 20% is just for maybe like those say like a small percentage of the base. Maybe help us think about sort of where the functionality is right now, how, how that affects or the cusp, the types of customers you can address and so where you see this going forward.\nEric Yuan: Yes. So Phil, that's a good question. So maybe I'd like to share with you a little bit analogy about what's going on in the smartphone industry. The first time I saw the Blackberry I knew that all the feature phone that era is over, all of those feature phone died because the Blackberry does offer something new in other feature phone can offer, which is email. I fell in love with Blackberry for many, many years until I saw the iPhone. I saw the iPhone. I know, Blackberry is over because the reason why they have a marketplace, all kinds of applications, even if the iPhone doesn't offer some of the functionalities that were already available in Blackberry, that's a trend in the feature phone marketplace. Something similar is happening in the club, in PBX market. On the other hand, you are so right. We lack off some of the features, the how customer look at our product first, look at the unified collaborating express. And with one more click they can screen share and you can, obligated to video call, they say, wow, that's a future. That is something so critical into most of other minor features, they knew we can add it. That's the reason why iPhone today versus the Blackberry. I think that's the same story now.\nOperator: Yes. Our next and final question is from Jonathan Kees with Summit Insights Group.\nJonathan Kees: Great. Well, glad I made it in. Thank you for picking my questions and I'll add my kudos to your strong numbers. And yes, and also commend you for the humanitarian efforts you're making there. My questions are, I guess if you can update us in terms of your partnership with Ring Central, Five9, the apartments where you're white label, basically any of the partners were there the lead in to a deal they bring you in, in the past, you've talked about how that's trending and trending well, you've been updated us on that and quantify anything for us. That'd be great. And then I have one other question.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Thank you, Jonathan. By the way, we have very good feature called what's your background, if you want to try.\nJonathan Kees: I'm still learning it, so maybe, I will confirm to stay in the background. Right now I have a couple home office.\nTom McCallum: I'm happy to follow up with you, Jonathan. Make sure you can get it. Not a problem.\nJonathan Kees: Ir/itsupport. Great.\nTom McCallum: Yes, and sales.\nJonathan Kees: And sales, okay.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Speaking of partnerships, taking Five9 for example. I think this year we'll achieve more because the two team we enjoy working together, right. So I know Rowan Trollope is such a great a leader. I think the more customers, they will allow you to hey, I want the deploy Zoom Phone, I also want to pick up a contact center solution Five9 is great, the partner and along with some other contact centers and partners as well. In Ring Central, they were all very good partner over the past several years. And today, I think they're pretty smart, partnering with the best way to service. And that's why we build solution for them, which is really central meetings, that partnership really have a residential in terms of becoming the unified communication, marketed leader because they have a best with the confidence service. However, I think from our perspective and we would like it to really look at our customer and look at what's the best experience we can offer. And as this trend over the past several years, they tried to build their own way to conference solution. I don't know how good that is solution is, but we are focused on our customer experience. And in terms of revenue from any of our customers is relatively small, right. On customer, we would like to deploy a unified solution from other vendor from us. We do voice the same architecture, same thing first, and you will see more and more overlap. It will be just Zoom and Ring Central, in particular after they announced they are, we do conference service and I'm pretty sure that experience is not as good as Zoom.\nJonathan Kees: I'm sure. I'm sure. And then, if I can, I guess it's more out of curiosity, you've already talked about your headquarters employees working from home cause COVID-19. You have most of your sales, the direct sales and field reps are knocking on doors. I guess are you seeing a impact there and are you going to change the strategy there or is that what you're doing with like channel and getting others to start selling for you? Thank you.\nEric Yuan: I don't see we are going to have any impact whatsoever. The reason why our sales rep, proved accretive and we also support video background. They should follow a video in office and user with the back on, I don't know where they are. And seriously, I feel like I stayed in the office and I would have seen that as no any impact. Probably even better because you can see the commuter time, from where they live to office probably they should have increased the quota for them. I think, I'm kidding.\nTom McCallum: Well, Eric, I think that's the last question. Matt, is anyone else out there?\nOperator: That was our last question.\nTom McCallum: Great. Do you want to have some closing remarks and just thank everyone, Eric?\nEric Yuan: First of all, thank you all for your time. I really appreciate for your support and we will do all we can to deal with a much better service to serve our customers well. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you everyone.\nKelly Steckelberg: Bye everybody. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Appreciate it. Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and hello everyone. Let me start by reviewing our financial results for Q4, then discussing our outlook for Q1 and the full year of FY21. As Eric said, Q4 was a strong end to the year. We delivered another amazing quarter with continued traction for all offerings across all major geographies. For Q4 specifically, total revenue grew 78% year-over-year, to $188 million. This top line result exceeded the high-end of our guidance range by $12 million due to our strong sales execution in the quarter. We delivered our Zoom Meetings, Rooms and Phone solutions to new accounts while driving major expansions with existing customers. For the quarter, new customers accounted for approximately 59% of our year-over-year growth in subscription revenue while the remaining 41% was due to additional purchases from existing customers. Now, let me share some of the key customer metrics for Q4: We added approximately 7,800 customers with more than 10 employees quarter-over-quarter and exited Q4 with 81,900 customers. This is an increase of 31,100 new customers, or 61% year-over-year. Customers with more than 10 employees represented approximately 80% of revenue in FY20, compared to approximately 78% in the prior fiscal year. Our continued expansion in the up-market resulted in 641 customers with more than $100,000 in trailing twelve months revenue, up 86% year-over-year. This is an increase of 95 customers, a record number of adds in a quarter. The high level of satisfaction and trust customers have in Zoom was evident in our net dollar expansion rate that was over 130% for the seventh consecutive quarter and our Net Promoter Score which remained above 70 in Q4. Next, international expansion outpaced the high rate of growth in Americas revenue. In Q4, our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew 84% year-over-year and represented approximately 20% of revenue. Revenue from the Americas was up 77% year-over-year and represented approximately 80% of revenue. International expansion will continue to be one of our key growth initiatives in FY21 and beyond. Now turning to profitability. Once again, we were net income profitable from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives, but I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and related share-based equity taxes. Non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter was 84.2%, compared to 82.1% in Q4 last year and 82.9% last quarter. This result was driven by the strong sales execution in the quarter and lower seasonal audio usage in Q4 due to the extended holiday season. Due to the coronavirus, we have already seen significant usage of our platform and accordingly we will expand our capacity to meet the increased demands of both paid and free users. For FY21, we believe our gross margins will be at the lower end of our long term target of 80% to 82%. R&D expense in Q4 was approximately $16 million, up 60% year-over-year. As a percent of total revenue, R&D was 9%, which was slightly lower than Q4 last year. In FY21, we plan to continue investing in our highly efficient R&D model to drive innovation through adding engineering talent, especially in the first half of the year. Sales and marketing expense for Q4 was $84 million. This reflects an increase of 57% or $30 million dollars over last year with investments to drive further growth. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing was 45%, lower than Q4 last year due to continued efficiency gains in marketing combined with slightly slower than expected sales hiring and the higher than forecasted revenue. We look to increase the pace of hiring in the up-market and internationally in FY21 with additional resources being added to recruiting. G&A expense in Q4 was $20 million, up 49% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 11% of total revenue, benefiting from efficiencies as we scale our administrative functions and lower our accrual for telco taxes. Non-GAAP operating income was $38 million, translating to a 20.4% non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter. This compares to Q4 last year's result of $10 million and 9.3% margin. The higher revenue plus expense efficiencies across all areas were the main drivers of this additional profit. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4 was $0.15, on approximately 293 million of non-GAAP, weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.08 cents higher than our guidance and $0.11 cents higher than Q4 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $231 million, up 83% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, totaled approximately $604 million, up 94% from $312 million last year. We expect to recognize approximately 62% or $375 million of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 67% or $208 million in Q4 last year. This is a result of the mix shift between current RPO which grew 81% year-over-year, while non-current RPO grew 120% year-over-year as we closed longer term deals. The RPO results also reflect some expected seasonality benefits in Q4 due to our semi-annual quotas in the up-market segment of our business. We ended Q4 with approximately $855 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. In Q4, operating cash flow was $37 million, up from $16 million or 129% year-over-year. Free cash flow was $27 million, up from $6 million or 368% year-over-year. As we previously discussed, these results reflect the use of cash for the purchase of shares via the Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Starting in FY21, we expect the cadence of benefits from contributions to the ESPP to occur in Q1 and Q3 and net outflows from purchases to occur in Q2 and Q4. Now turning to guidance, we are pleased to provide a strong outlook for the full year FY21 based on our view of the current business environment, our ability to gain market share and with the momentum we built in FY20. For the full year of FY21, we expect revenue to be in the range of $905 million to $915 million, which would be approximately 45% to 47% year-over-year growth. Non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $110 million to $120 million. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.42 to $0.45 for the full year FY21, based on approximately 301 million shares outstanding. For the first quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $199 million to $201 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $25 million to $27 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.10 based on approximately 297 million shares outstanding. In closing, we executed very well and are proud of the results we delivered in our first year as a public company. Our high growth outlook at this scale is truly unique. Given our ROI-focused business model, we continue to deliver a rare combination of strong profitability and free cash flow margins along with our top line growth. I would also like to thank the entire Zoom team for their hard work this past year and look forward to achieving additional market share gains and growth as we deliver happiness to our customers with our unified communications platform. With that, let's open it up for questions. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue-up our first question. In terms of our results in Slide 4, Q4, we did not see any impact directly related to coronavirus and as a reminder we have definitely seen an up tick in usage. But a lot of that is on the free side. So it's very early to tell whether or not that's going to convert long-term into paying customers. As we mentioned, we are seeing impact and if continue to build capacity to ensure that we can support this increased usage. So we are seeing impact on our gross margins, which is why we're guiding you towards the lower end of our range for next year. Matt, she is on mute still. So yes, we're super excited that we added 11 new countries into GA for Zoom Phone taking us to 18 total countries that were GA and additional 25 in beta. So we're getting close to, I think the coverage that the goal is to be in close to 50 countries by the end of this year, which is really what we're striving for. And a couple of key markets like India and China, we're still continuing to work on. And then in terms of the gross margin impact, no, we really haven't seen impact from Zoom Phone as we talked about. It's still small relative to the overall usage that it's not having an impact on the gross margins. It's really coming from the increase that we're seeing globally in terms of -- in the last month or so related mostly to coronavirus. Yes. So we're really excited to announce that we just yesterday I guess launched our master agent program for phones specifically and we've signed up two big partners in Mphasis and Avant. And the more formal launch will be next week at the channel conference. Yes. Thank you. So there's a couple of things that contribute to our net dollar expansion rate. It's land and expand as you touched on as well as Zoom Phone. So we really see great opportunity for that number to be influenced by Zoom Phone as well as land-and-expand is a critical part. I mean it does vary quarter-over-quarter depending as you just indicated on the size of the initial deals. But we're confident for the long term that it'll stay at about 130. Yes. That's the first one, is get a virtual background. That helps a lot. Well, we believe that we were already very competitively priced from both Zoom Phone and Zoom Meetings perspective against the market. And we haven't seen price pressure beyond kind of the normal discounting that we typically do. And we feel really good about where we're sitting. The way that we historically brought value to our customers is by adding more and more features to both meetings and phone. And we will continue to do that approach across all of our product lines. I think in terms of use cases we talked about the doctors getting therapy. We also of course see lots of educational institutions that have stopped either study abroad programs or having all of their students study from home as well as we've seen a few of our customers here that have already moved to -- requiring their employees to work from home as well. And so we're seeing an increase in that sense. Yes. A lot of virtual events. Yes. It's actually been really steady at that same 20% of revenue for FY20. I think over time as we continue to focus more and more on the up market, we'll see that overall percentage decrease, but it's been pretty steady and consistent over the last year. Yes. We haven't seen any trade changes. It's been pretty consistent. It's holding pretty steady. Yes. So just a quick reminder that RPO is not absolute directional metric for us due to -- there's a significant percentage of our customers who both buy and pay monthly so it doesn't correlate the way you would expect it to run other enterprise customers. And in terms of the seasonality, if you remember when we talked about this in Q3, we saw some seasonality in terms of it being somewhat flatter Q2 to Q3 and now we're seeing that benefit in Q4 due to the fact that our up market teams are on six months plans. And so what we see is, as it gets to the end of their six month plans and they have the opportunity obviously to overachieve and then go into accelerators that we see a typical linearity toward or seasonality towards the back half of their six month plan. And that's what you're seeing in some of that increase for the RPO for Q4. Ryan, do you have your phone on mute there? Bye everybody. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom. Thank you and welcome everyone joining us on the Zoom Video webinar. At Zoom, we strive to empower our customers to accomplish more with our video-first unified communications platform. Our success toward achieving this goal is evident in our results with the fourth quarter capping off a strong year for Zoom, our first year as a public company. Kelly will discuss our Q4 results and outlook in detail in a moment, so let me give you a few key highlights for the full year. For FY20, we delivered a unique combination of high revenue, profitability and a free cash flow growth. Revenue grew 88% to $623 million and we exited Q4 at an annualized run rate of $0.75 billion. We achieved non-GAAP operating margin of 14.2%, up over 900 basis points year-over-year. We generated free cash flow of $114 million for the full year, up 397% year-over-year. This is our 4th straight year of positive free cash flow and non-GAAP operating income. Our customer metrics were also impressive for FY20, including 86% growth year-over-year for customers with $100,000 of trailing twelve months revenue. We also recently celebrated the one year anniversary of the launch of Zoom Phone, a key component of the Zoom unified communications platform that has significantly expanded our TAM. Zoom Phone had an incredible start and we are excited about the continued momentum of the offering. Here are just a few of the key metrics to demonstrate some of the Zoom Phone accomplishments we had this past year: First, we are grateful to have existing customers who trust us and new customers who have looked to Zoom Phone to resolve their telephone challenges. These factors enabled us to close Zoom Phone deals with approximately 2,900 customers who have more than 10 employees. Second, we exited the year with a run rate of 230 million Zoom Phone minutes. Zoom Phone is a great opportunity to expand our footprint with existing customers and drive new logos for companies looking to modernize away from legacy PBX systems. Now let me discuss a few of our happy customers. We are thrilled to welcome Johnson and Johnson, the world's largest and most broadly-based health care company, to the Zoom family. We are grateful that Johnson and Johnson chose Zoom to help modernize and consolidate on a unified communications platform with approximately 60,000 Zoom meeting users. As a global company they wanted a solution that would enable them to communicate reliably around the world including growing regions in Asia. Thank you Johnson and Johnson. I also want to thank VMware for trusting Zoom. VMware has been providing all employees, globally, access to Zoom meetings and digital workspace, and will soon utilize a large deployment of Zoom Phone. The easy, single sign-on access to Zoom from any device is enabled to leverage the VMware Workspace ONE platform, allowing employees to access all the applications they need from their device of choice while ensuring security and compliance. Together with Zoom, VMware Workspace ONE helps businesses support their distributed workforces by enabling a remote-first culture. Thank you VMware. Moving to a few recent business highlights: First, in the 2020 Gartner Peer Insights Customers' Choice Award for Meeting Solutions, Zoom received the top overall rating in the \u201cVoice of the Customer\u201d category. Zoom was the only company to achieve Customers' Choice Awards for meeting solutions serving all listed regions, company sizes, and industry verticals. Second, Okta published their annual Businesses @ Work 2020 Report, a premier study of how organizations and people are using technology in the enterprise. The report highlighted Zoom as a preferred video application, posting 876% growth in the Okta network over the past 3 years! Zoom is the only company to earn the distinction of being both the fastest growing and most popular app. Third, we announced an expansion of our Global Channel Partner Program to add new partnerships with industry-leading Master Agents for Zoom Phone. Fourth, Caring for our community is a core value for Zoom and we are conscious of our impact on the environment. We proudly announced our top ten Green Leader customers, who were estimated to avoid the most carbon dioxide emissions by replacing in-person meetings with Zoom video meetings. In a 90 day period, the top ten customers were estimated to have avoided the equivalent of the annual carbon dioxide emissions of 149,000 cars. Before turning the webinar over to Kelly, I'd also like to address the global impact we are seeing from the coronavirus. While this tragic situation is very fluid, Zoom is focused on using our resources to help alleviate some of the disruption and communication challenges as an alternative to in-person meetings for our employees, customers and community I am happy to report that all of our employees in the affected areas are healthy. Given the recent emergence and growing number of coronavirus cases in the United States, we have directed our Headquarter employees to work from home, unless there is a business-critical need for them to be in the office. We're taking this step out of abundance of caution. Zoom is doing everything we can, especially for global educational institutions, to provide resources and support our customers and those navigating the coronavirus outbreak, including: We are proactively monitoring capacity globally to ensure maximum reliability amid usage increases. In China, we have removed the 40 minute limit on free meetings. And we are providing informational sessions and on-demand resources so anyone can learn how to use the Zoom platform with ease. With the reliability of our high quality video platform, we have seen a large increase in the number of free users, meeting minutes and new video use cases. For instance, in China, healthcare workers under stressful conditions in affected areas are able to connect live on video with therapists. In closing, I'd like to thank the over 2,500 Zoom employees who are building Zoom into a great company through caring for our customers, community, company, teammates, and themselves. As we remain focused on creating a culture built around happiness and caring, I know we will position Zoom for future success. With that, let me turn things over to Kelly. Nikolay, that's good question. First of all, I liked your voice and background, where are you now? I think a first of all, I don't think that's temporary. The reason why is, I mean, in terms of experience about, they using the video conference like Zoom. Look at a company as a sitting commodity like InVision, Zapier, or Gitlab was great companies, they do not have a single physical office. You really understand, how do we enable remote workers to work together? However, if you look at conference out, a part of the ward or maybe you know, other side of California, quite often we needed help. We knew in the future of a communication union of the enable video and as we needed to explain that. But given this coronavirus, I think the over the night almost everybody read and understand, they needed a tool like this. This will dramatically change the landscape. I should believe in the future, everyone will take on to video for the remote workers for the collaboration. By the way, I ever mentioned this to some of my friends. If I start over the company, well, I'm not going to have a single physical office. A lot of people as I mentioned, are you crazy? Now realize that's reality now. Yes. That's a good question. So when we started, we do not know which vertical market we are going to focus on. And fortunately, we saw quite a few high end customers who deployed Zoom. Stanford started its group was our first customer. And that's why our first vertical market is high-ed. And several years ago, we found a great use case which is healthcare customers because they are looking for a solution because we target kind of medicine, [indiscernible] because there's no good solution and here they found Zoom and we also keep our compliance, the product is first and its Epic, I think that's very, very important vertical market. Also at the same time, we also, last year we got a federal certificate. We also expanded into the public sector market by focusing on enterprise, healthcare, public sectors and also I think later last year we also expanded into the financial institutions. I think all of those vertical market, use case is a little bit different, but our functionality, our feature and flexibility and truly amazing. I think for the foreseeable future and video and voice, unified communications, that's a huge market, right, for this billion dollars market. I think we are going to be very busy like especially for enterprise migrate to the cloud, video voice will be converted into web service. We are going to laser focus on video and voice. But, at the same time , we also build a platform, our marketplace there are already over 200 applications. We like to integrate with other collaboration vendors with focusing on the content, like Dropbox and Box, like Okat or Max Soft. I think that's the way. While customer, they are looking for the best of breed of service, right, with intercoms video and voice, I think that's our game. Yes. That's a good question. First of all, we all feel sorry about those who have suffered from coronavirus in China and all over the world. We're super grateful to those doctors for having the war to deal with coronavirus. I think that's why, we really focus on how to have those companies, those workers to connect, because in this critical time, I want to say empathy, humanity and support for each other is more important, then revenue, then growth. At this moment, we are laser focused on offering the best of service to have the people in the world. We even never thought about it, monetize because that's not our focus. That's not important. If you truly care about the customers, truly deliver value to the word, I think all of those will follow in the future. I think that in my view, I feel everybody is in the sweet spot now. So because you look at our installed base, from SMB all the way optical unified customers, we may talk about Zoom phone, after they test that they say, wow, that's exactly what they are looking for. We see the greater costumer adoption from SAP customer, Zoom Phone VMR as well because experience is very different, right? If you look at all other phone systems, no matter on-prem phone system or cloud-based phone system. Ultimately, you are just kind of make a phone call. While studying, I call your phone number, we come when we talk. We really cannot go ahead and say ours. With Zoom Phone, it is very different. One more click I can see you, I can share the content. That's a totally different architecture. That's why if you look at our install base after tests, our solutions really like our experience. No any other solutions can match that experience. Heather, thank you. I know you are probably traveling. So next time we can see you and that's a good question. So in terms of Zoom Phone effort, we don't assume that's brand new application possibly maybe with a platform. The first application that is built upon a platform is to do conference. The second obligation is a Zoom Phone. So, many of us share lots of the components, when we build the Zoom Phone system, having said that, there are some features missing and also international coverage as well. We are making very, very good progress as Kelly just shared. In terms of this year, we are adding a little bit more features like recently we can also SMS, the beta, right? And also add a lot of features. All those features, I do know things, I could assess, really just a partition level of work. The harder part already done, right? That's why we have a high confidence we can deliver a much better solution than any of our potential competitors. So regarding the Avaya-Ring Center deal, I think from our perspective, we really focus on our installed base focus on video and voice convergence. That's the kind of our region. And today looking at some of the customer take VMware, right? They deployed on-premise solutions and some other costumers also deployed maybe the on-prem Avaya solutions. When they evaluate which club has PBX solution to go. If they do the test, they will now that. Zoom experience is better. It's better than any other club as PBX vendors, we have high confidence as long as customers try our solutions. That's a solution to go. Yes. Good question. So if you look at our R&D resources, the core R&D here, our Headquarter in San Jose. And we also have a team in China and of course, I met at a WebEx engineer team before. I'm very familiar with that process, how to manage the offshore team. And inside of that actually we are using Zoom Video every day. So we need every engineer's anytime, anywhere that can work for sure have a secured process. And we are already familiar with remote working, practice for long, long time. During the coronavirus, a lot of other business they have to work in a home. I think quite often we got to -- really don't know how to do that or we know how. That's why, over the past several weeks, most of them already back to work. Over the past several weeks when they went back to home to work, there's no any impact whatsoever because they already know how to do that. And here we also did not see any impact. We're still working together with our team for sure we all know how to use a Zoom. I think the impact to us is a very minimum. And for us, this year, I know next two years I think we're going to hire more and more resources here. For the new services, a lot of artificial intelligence features and the core capabilities, of course, the core IP R&D is still developer here because that's why we further expand our R&D team here in our headquarter this year and also positive for the future as well. Yes. That's a good question. So by the way, today we also have our Annual Analyst meetings as well. And in addition to talking with our customers, I think [indiscernible], I think this is a very critical moment. So meaning, I think the more the more benefits, we are going to leverage the video conferencing service like Zoom, it drive our productivity, no matter where those employees are, they still want to get a job done. However, when it comes from video conferencing, the key is that you have to make it work anytime, anywhere with any device. Otherwise they're not going to use it. And because of this coronavirus, a lot of businesses have removed employees, after they tried Zoom first time, a lot of users first time try Zoom, they say, wow, it's just works. I think because of that, I think this is a very exciting time in terms of how to further drive the video conferencing adoption. I think this is very sustainable. Yes, that's good question. So you're looking at our revenue, also the revenue from Asia and China included is relatively small, right? It's kind of still driven by North America and Europe and in Japan, Australia, I think because of this coronavirus, I think China realized, I think they didn't have more tools, not only Zoom, more and more the B2B tools to drive their productivity, used to be like seeing 10 people, right? You do not need to deploy HR tools, but now you really cannot have those 10 people anymore, they all went back to home. I think this will further boost the B2B SaaS application adoption in China, I have decided that video conferencing is a tool they all understand. We also have some local competitors, but the market is there, potential is big and also we're in the process of -- never going to source several options. To say which option is better because over the past several years, we really wanted to go to China market. However, I do not think the time is right. For now, I think its coming right, we needed to make sure we have a sustainable strategy to expand into China to have the local benefits there. So first of all, I do not realize you are at home. I did not realize. I think that's pretty much actually, in terms of we have all the features built-in, right? And when you just clear on some features, you will see that like, I think sample, my favorite feature is a touch up my appearance. And also to see which background, a lot of features are built-in. And it was a small, like a breakout session as well. And a lot of which are to built-in the past several years. I think, finally, our customer realized, it's time to clear on all the features, we will build further. So in terms of -- a comment about some of the vendors offering the free video conferencing. I can tell you, it's very easy. It's extremely easy to build a very, very basic video conferencing solution with some open source. But, however, to have a global scale, very secure, reliable, five minute availability, it just works. It's extremely hard, right? I'm always already in this real-time collaboration base, almost 23 years. Today, you look at where we are now, there is still a lot of missing that are not done yet. I think free, no, I mean your customer, they want to use that service. So voice on a video is a same platform, but [indiscernible] quite often if you -- which already shared the same the platform encryption, right? We have encryption and process we are working on what a customer key, the improvements that based on the key offered by customers, but sometimes, voice is a little bit different. With Zoom we can offer very secured service. However, if you want to dial someone else, the several number or the PSV network, will go to the traditional PSV network as I've seen it is really hard because it's completely out of our control. I'm going to start. Feel free to tell me, Kelly. I think over the past several weeks, first of all, we see the very, very big job from users in China. And the good news, we have a very flexible, the banking architecture. We can auto scale our servers. That's why, within a several days and we added a lot of capacity. And really focus on the product, especially the customer there are very, very happy. And also afterwards you see like we see the usage, not the one with China, for Vietnam or Singapore or Japan all follow over the past several weeks. Essentially I think look at APAC almost the every country uses a lot. And last week, we see the uses from Europe and here as well, it's kind of take the print to see the use this job. Why use case service not only we do offer the video, we also offer the video web in a platform. It's pretty powerful. And the sitting that we will have -- they have a -- since there are doctors, for a long time depression, anxiety and the [indiscernible] university number one in China also with some other psychologist, they use Zoom and to treat the doctors there, as it's a good use case and it really made those doctors in Wuhan very, very happy. Yes. You're right on. So we focused on our call video and voice capability in terms of cognitive center, I think it's very different market from our perspective. However, from a costumer perspective they would like to have [indiscernible] integration. That's why we are partner with Five9 and also Twilio and Genesys, specifically about Five9. Steve Rowe is great leader, really it's an collaboration, the two team worked together very well and like Zoom we also use our video conference -- Zoom phone system. We also deploy Five9 and the solution works very well. I think a huge opportunity between Zoom and Five9. So ultimately we wanted to partner with other contact centers solutions. Yes. That's good question. I think, first of all, I'd like to take a step back into service. What's happening in part of that decision-making process for lot of invest? Because over the term of 10 or 20 years, nobody say, we couldn't find it. Today is very different. Almost the 50% of workforce is today here, I mean, annuals, right? And they've grown up along with a smartphone. And that's why, if you do not like your service, no matter what, they are not going to use your service. This is their habit, right? This is their experience. Having said that, I think land and expand influenced the by the bottom up users extremely critical, right? Quite often they already use the Dropbox. Already use a Slack. And they want to find out the best way to service, like we do in voice, also deploy Zoom. That's why we have very, very tight integration with Dropbox. Within Dropbox interface, you can log to Zoom. With the Slack, it also got to Zoom. I think that's a trend. Basically the service will drive the adoption, will truly deliver happiness to land customers. I think if you look at alternative quarter, over the past several years. And Zoom is becoming the most of popular video conferencing application. Look at our customers, quite often, especially for large enterprise customers or medium size customers, we already deploy other solutions, but they did not use that we are open. And it's also the different experience. It's more like a web conferencing -- only conferencing and a Zoom is a true cloud -- video first solution. And that's why they all want to switch to Zoom. It's not like from web solution, other solution, I believe this is a totally different service. We are in a different category because more like a Tesla car and the other care, they are all cars, they are totally separated. They have been a category. That's why I think in from that perspective, I would say every customer, no matter which other solutions they are using today as a greenfield. That's our experienced. Yes. So Phil, that's a good question. So maybe I'd like to share with you a little bit analogy about what's going on in the smartphone industry. The first time I saw the Blackberry I knew that all the feature phone that era is over, all of those feature phone died because the Blackberry does offer something new in other feature phone can offer, which is email. I fell in love with Blackberry for many, many years until I saw the iPhone. I saw the iPhone. I know, Blackberry is over because the reason why they have a marketplace, all kinds of applications, even if the iPhone doesn't offer some of the functionalities that were already available in Blackberry, that's a trend in the feature phone marketplace. Something similar is happening in the club, in PBX market. On the other hand, you are so right. We lack off some of the features, the how customer look at our product first, look at the unified collaborating express. And with one more click they can screen share and you can, obligated to video call, they say, wow, that's a future. That is something so critical into most of other minor features, they knew we can add it. That's the reason why iPhone today versus the Blackberry. I think that's the same story now. Yes. Thank you, Jonathan. By the way, we have very good feature called what's your background, if you want to try. Yes. Speaking of partnerships, taking Five9 for example. I think this year we'll achieve more because the two team we enjoy working together, right. So I know Rowan Trollope is such a great a leader. I think the more customers, they will allow you to hey, I want the deploy Zoom Phone, I also want to pick up a contact center solution Five9 is great, the partner and along with some other contact centers and partners as well. In Ring Central, they were all very good partner over the past several years. And today, I think they're pretty smart, partnering with the best way to service. And that's why we build solution for them, which is really central meetings, that partnership really have a residential in terms of becoming the unified communication, marketed leader because they have a best with the confidence service. However, I think from our perspective and we would like it to really look at our customer and look at what's the best experience we can offer. And as this trend over the past several years, they tried to build their own way to conference solution. I don't know how good that is solution is, but we are focused on our customer experience. And in terms of revenue from any of our customers is relatively small, right. On customer, we would like to deploy a unified solution from other vendor from us. We do voice the same architecture, same thing first, and you will see more and more overlap. It will be just Zoom and Ring Central, in particular after they announced they are, we do conference service and I'm pretty sure that experience is not as good as Zoom. I don't see we are going to have any impact whatsoever. The reason why our sales rep, proved accretive and we also support video background. They should follow a video in office and user with the back on, I don't know where they are. And seriously, I feel like I stayed in the office and I would have seen that as no any impact. Probably even better because you can see the commuter time, from where they live to office probably they should have increased the quota for them. I think, I'm kidding. First of all, thank you all for your time. I really appreciate for your support and we will do all we can to deal with a much better service to serve our customers well. Thank you."

Joining me today will be Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan; and Zoom\u2019s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg, who is actually joining us remotely from Los Angeles, demonstrating another capability of using Zoom Video Webinar for its earnings announcement. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page on the Zoom.com website. Also, on this page, you\u2019ll be able to find a copy of today\u2019s prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings press release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During the call, we may make forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and other future events or trends, including guidance. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that can affect our performance and financial results and which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today\u2019s press release and our latest 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today\u2019s webinar. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Tom. Thank you, and welcome and thank you all for joining us on today\u2019s Zoom video webinar. I\u2019m very pleased to report that we had another strong quarter as evidenced by a combination of high revenue growth of 85%, with increased profitability and free cash flow of $54.7 million. We continue to have success with customers of all sizes and one metric that has continued to impress is customers with more than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue. This metric grew 97% from Q3 last year. Our execution so far this year has put us in a position to finish the year strong and we are raising our revenue and profitability outlook for the fourth quarter, as well as full fiscal year. As Kelly will discuss in a moment, our strong third quarter results were driven by two factors. First, our ability to attract new customers; and second, our commitment to customer happiness, which creates trust and enables us to significantly grow commitments with our existing customers. Let me discuss some of the largest deals we closed this quarter with two happy customers. Both expanded their footprint of our unified communications platform. I\u2019m excited that the U.S. Postal Service is starting to deploy Zoom Meetings more broadly across the organization after an extensive proof-of-concept. The USPS is our first major agency, major business win since we received FedRAMP approval in May. They chose Zoom for our high quality video and audio. Thank you USPS. I love you. We are also grateful to have National Australia Bank as part of the Zoom family. NAB is undertaking a large technology transformation and is looking to Zoom to support its enterprise telephone and video conferencing services in order to better connect its workforce of more than 30,000 employees. NAB is Australia\u2019s largest business bank and one of our largest financial service customers in the region. Since selecting Zoom in 2018 to help seamlessly connect it\u2019s workforce across any device and internationally, they have continued to grow and adopt Zoom services throughout their business. In Q3, the bank selected Zoom to support the telephony systems for a new Sydney-based major office building development. Zoom Phone was selected to support a unified communications approach, as the bank adopts a wireless working environment, as well as delivering projected cost savings and enhanced features and functionality. They will begin rolling out Zoom Softphones to over 6,500 users next year, focusing on tenants of the new building, as well as continuing to expand their Zoom Rooms footprint. We\u2019re excited to continue delivering improved experiences for the bank through a full end-to-end communication platform, which helps better connect their workforce. Thank you National Australia Bank. Now, let me discuss a couple of business highlights from Q3. First, analyst firm Gartner named Zoom a leader for the fourth consecutive time in their Magic Quadrant for Meeting Solutions. We are grateful that Gartner has recognized Zoom for our completeness of vision and our ability to execute once again. And second, we held our premier customer event, Zoomtopia, my favorite event of the year. It is only our third Zoomtopia and we had record registrations of 2,600, up over 80% from last year. During the event, customers like AB-InBev, Autodesk, Electronic Arts, Uber and Walmart shared their stories. Many of these customers spoke to how frictionless Zoom experiences are driving happiness with internal and external stakeholders. It\u2019s truly amazing and humbling to hear from so many happy customers from around the world. Also, at Zoomtopia, we were proud to announce expansions to our platform, including our new Zoom Rooms Appliance Program, expanded Zoom Phone service and capabilities, and the growth of our App Marketplace. Our customers tell us that Zoom just works, and with these new innovations, we empower teams to do even more with video communications. In closing, I\u2019d like to thank the over 2,400 Zoom employees for their hard work and focus on our customers. Their commitment to customer happiness and execution at scale will enable us to finish the year strong and position us for future growth. With that, let me turn things over to Kelly. Tom, your mic is unmute.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone joining us. Let me start by first reviewing the financial results for Q3 and then I will discuss our outlook for Q4 and the full fiscal year. Overall, we delivered another amazing quarter and demand for Zoom\u2019s unified communication platform remained strong across our major geographies and offerings. Total revenue grew 85% year-over-year in the third quarter to $167 million. This top line result exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. Key drivers of our revenue performance included both our acquisition of new customers and expansion of Zoom\u2019s footprint within existing customers. Specifically, new customers accounted for approximately 61% of our year-over-year growth in subscription revenue, while the remaining 39% was due to additional purchases from existing customers. Now, let me share some of the key customer metrics for Q3. Our two-pronged strategy of land and expand continued to drive growth. First, we added 7,800 customers with more than 10 employees in the period and exited Q3 with over 74,100 customers, up 67% year-over-year. Our continued expansion in the up-market resulted in 546 customers with more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue, up 97% year-over-year. This is an increase of 80 customers and a record number of adds in a quarter. Our ability to expand with existing customers was evident in our net dollar expansion rate that was over 130% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our net dollar expansion rate remains at the top tier of our industry and reflects the high level of satisfaction and trust that customers have in Zoom. This is further evidenced by our Net Promoter Score, which remained above 70 in Q3. Eric discussed two examples of how this strategy contributed to our Q3 results and let me give you a third one. During the quarter, we had an expanded commitment from Quinnipiac University, a nationally-ranked private university in Connecticut with over 10,000 students. The university originally moved to Zoom Meetings based on the ease of use and reliability of the technology, as well as a way to consolidate into one platform for their diverse community of users. Looking to drive further adoption of an innovative communications platform, the university has also selected Zoom Phone to modernize their phone system. The University has been a great partner and applauded Zoom\u2019s willingness to work with the university to enhance the feature sets of our technology on their journey toward a unified communications platform. Next, as we discussed at our recent Analyst Day, international expansion is a key multi-year growth initiative for Zoom. In Q3, our APAC and EMEA revenue combined grew 98% year-over-year and represented approximately 20% of revenue. Revenue from the Americas was up 82% year-over-year and represented approximately 80% of revenue. We see significant opportunity ahead for international expansion. Now turning to profitability. Our sales execution in Q3 also helped drive strong growth in our profitability and free cash flow. We were net income profitable from both a GAAP and a non-GAAP perspective, but today, I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and related share-based equity taxes. Non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 82.9%, compared to 81.7% in Q3 last year and 82.2% last quarter. For the full-year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be at the top-end of our long-term target of 80% to 82%. R&D expense in Q3 was approximately $14 million, up 64% on a year-over-year basis. As Eric discussed, we announced several expansions to our platform at Zoomtopia. We continue to invest in innovating our platform with our highly efficient R&D model. Given our hiring plans over the next several quarters, we expect R&D to return to the top end of the range of 10% to 12%, which is consistent with our long term view. Sales and marketing expense for Q3 was $82 million. This reflects an increase of 58%, or $30 million over last year with investments in initiatives to drive further growth. As a percent of total revenue, sales and marketing was 49%, lower than Q3 last year, but up from Q2 due to Zoomtopia. We expect to generate a great return on investment in this area and we expect to increase hiring for international up-market growth initiatives in Q4 and into FY 2021. G&A expense in Q3 was $21 million and represented 12% of total revenue. This compares to last quarter and last year, which both were 12% of total revenue. Non-GAAP operating income was $21 million, translating to a 13% non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter. This was an increase of approximately $19 million, as compared to Q3\u2019s last \u2013 Q3 last year\u2019s result of $2 million. The main driver of this result was the higher revenue, while spending was mostly in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q3 was $0.09, on approximately 293 million of non-GAAP, weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.06 higher than our guidance and $0.08 higher than Q3 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with approximately $811 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $202 million, up 89% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, totaled approximately $517 million, up 102% from $256 million last year. We expect to recognize approximately 64%, or $330 million of the total RPO as revenue in the next 12 months, as compared to 65%, or $166 million in Q3 last year. Current RPO was up 99% year-over-year, the same growth rate as Q2\u2019s current RPO. Non-current RPO was up 108% year-over-year. Our execution led to strong cash flow growth. Operating cash flow was $62 million in Q3, up from $18 million, or 240% year-over-year. In Q3, free cash flow was $55 million, up from $10 million, or 440% year-over-year growth. As we discussed on last quarter\u2019s webinar, the benefit we received over the last two quarters from the Employee Stock Purchase Plan will become a use of cash in Q4 when the first purchase will be made. The quarter-over-quarter outflow in cash related to ESPP will be approximately $20 million in Q4. Starting in FY 2021, we expect the cadence of benefits from contributions to the ESPP to occur in Q1 and Q3 and net outflows from purchases to occur in Q2 and Q4. Now turning to guidance. We are pleased to be increasing our outlook for the full-year based on our view of the current business environment, our ability to gain market share and the momentum we have achieved so far this year. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $175 million to $176 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $17 million to $18 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.07, based on approximately 296 million shares outstanding. For the full-year of fiscal 2020, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $609 million to $610 million, up from our prior guidance of $587 million to $590 million. This would be approximately 85% year-over-year growth. For the full-year, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $67 million to $68 million, an increase of approximately 50% from the top-end of our prior guidance of $42 million to $45 million. With this meaningful increase in profitability, we now expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.27 for the full-year fiscal 2020, based on approximately 293 million shares outstanding. In closing, we are pleased with our progress this year and our unique ability to deliver high growth at scale, combined with profitability and free cash flow growth. I would also like to thank the entire Zoom team for their hard work in Q3. We are well-positioned to end the year strong as we stay focused on delivering happiness to our customers every day. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue up our first question.\nOperator: Our first question is from Brad from Credit Suisse. Hey, Brad, you\u2019re unmuted now.\nBrad Zelnick: Hi. Can you guys hear me?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Hey, Brad.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Brad.\nBrad Zelnick: Fantastic. It\u2019s great to see everybody, especially Eric and Tom on the beach enjoying themselves after such great results you deserve it.\nKelly Steckelberg: Brad, they wouldn\u2019t take me.\nBrad Zelnick: Well, Kelly is \u2013 fantastic. Well, Eric, it\u2019s great to see the traction that you\u2019re having with Zoom Phone, particularly the National Australia Bank deal that you highlighted. How\u2019s the pipeline trended since the focus on Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms at Zoomtopia? And when should we start to see you sign more of these Phone and Rooms deals?\nEric Yuan: So first of all, I can tell you, we\u2019re very excited about Zoom Phone opportunity. And even at Zoomtopia, we shared our vision, because we\u2019re seeing \u2013 we\u2019re conversing on a cloud with PBX, those truly can be converged into one service is cloud-based PBX. Customer really like this story. With that, we have one consistent upfront and experienced the same bug and architecture. I think a lot of our customers, I mean, existing customer, existing installed base for us have up-sell opportunity, that\u2019s huge. And free to bug from our existing installed base is very, very positive, especially after that goes through the few seats. Their feedback is, wow, that\u2019s amazing. I think, we have a high confidence about the future opportunities.\nBrad Zelnick: Okay, great. Thank you. And Kelly, just in follow-up, your operating and free cash flow profitability was very strong yet again. How has the company been executing against its sales and marketing productivity goals? And why not take some of the outperformance and invest it back into driving more customer ads, or would you be at a point of diminishing returns at that point?\nKelly Steckelberg: We certainly are committed to investing as much as possible in terms of continuing to drive growth in the top line. And we expect to see hiring to actually accelerate in Q4. So you should see our headcount numbers for the end of the year to finish really strong, as well as \u2013 Janine has seen a lot of progress in terms of efficiency and marketing. So we continue to look for opportunistic ways to add, but ensuring that we continue to produce a high ROI on any of our marketing spend.\nBrad Zelnick: Great.\nTom McCallum: Thanks, Brad.\nBrad Zelnick: Okay, great. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Brad. Matt, next question, please.\nEric Yuan: Tom, unmute.\nTom McCallum: Matt, you\u2019re unmute unfortunately.\nOperator: Sorry. Our next question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. And Sterling, you are unmuted now.\nSterling Auty: All right. Great. Thanks, guys. Given that you\u2019re sitting on the beach, I thought you\u2019d bring you a little virtual snow for a little white Christmas.\nEric Yuan: Yes.\nSterling Auty: All right. So actually, question to start with Kelly. The growth in current RPO, especially outpace what you saw in revenue. Is that kind of telling us something in terms of what the linearity look like in the quarter? And what should we be thinking that tells us in terms of the growth contribution here into the fourth quarter?\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Sterling. Hi. So you got it exactly right. What we\u2019re seeing is a couple of things, is that a lot of our seasonality is for renewals is lining up to be July and January. Due to the nature of our six-month quarter for our teams, as well as, as we continue to move more and more up-market, we\u2019re seeing a shift with those customers that deals with those customers to shift more and more, not only to the back-end of the year, but also to the back-end of the quarter, which is exactly what\u2019s driving that.\nSterling Auty: All right. Great. And then one follow-up question for you, Eric. I think the big news in the quarter was the deal that RingCentral signed with a buyer. Can you give us a sense of what you think of that partnership? And is that something that would be interested to Zoom? Is there a partnership similar to that, that we might look for you to sign in the future?\nEric Yuan: So, first of all, I think, Brad, he already shared their view about the partnerships of Avaya. I\u2019m not going to repeat what he cited before. But from our perspective, I think, the, first of all, listen, we still have a customer, partner, and reseller, right? We\u2019re still in a good partnership and also this market is very big. And when we look at the cloud PBX system, I think it\u2019s different than any other vendors, because we should believe video and voice is the ones, that\u2019s why we will focus on our existing installed base for up-sell. It\u2019s essentially, customer whoever wants to deploy the traditional phone solution, I think they still might go with other vendors, that\u2019s okay. However, for those customers that would like to look at \u2013 we do first unified communication experience, I think, that\u2019s our opportunity. I think, occasionally, we might have a little bit of overlap. But overall, the market opportunity is huge and I think many are good partnership. And Avaya and RingCentral, I think, one is on-prem legacy vendor, another one is cloud PBX, and probably it\u2019s good for both of them. And we really focus on our existing installed base and deliver our converged solution to our installed base.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. All right. Fantastic. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Sterling.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you, Tom.\nTom McCallum: Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kash from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash, you are unmuted.\nEric Yuan: I think he\u2019s still muted.\nKash Rangan: Yes. Am I audible now?\nEric Yuan: Yes.\nTom McCallum: Yes, Kash.\nKash Rangan: Am I looking happy? Am I looking happy?\nTom McCallum: Yes, very happy.\nEric Yuan: Very happy.\nKash Rangan: Excellent, okay. I haven\u2019t had your backdrop, but I\u2019ll be there hopefully in a couple of weeks. I wanted to just ask you a little bit about the up-market traction. You talked about the HSBC win last quarter. This time, it\u2019s the USPS. When you look at the pipeline coming up for next fiscal year, what kind of enterprise deals are you seeing in the pipeline? And do you feel like you need to add more salespeople that come from the enterprise background, where you might need to invest a little bit more upfront, but the payoff can be certainly huge? And what does that mean for retention rates ultimately for the business model? Thank you so much and congratulations.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Kash, that\u2019s a wonderful question. So if you look at our growth potential, international and also enterprise, we already hired a lot of enterprise reps over the past 12 to 18 months. Also want to focus on the quality rather than just quantity. And from a leads perspective, it\u2019s very healthy. Like HSBC, like USPS and also government, public sector as well and especially for a lot of enterprise customers, they would like to go through the PUC to make sure of the solution they are going to deploy for the next several years. That\u2019s why architecture plays a very important role. That\u2019s why we are winning, especially when customer, they are going to go through the PUC. They want their employee involved to test the solution rather than just one person, two person make a decision to upgrade from the other legacy solutions to the new cloud solution. And inside of that, I think our pipeline is pretty healthy and we really are doubling down our enterprise expansion.\nKash Rangan: Great. And, Kelly, if I could follow-up with you on the free cash flow side, there are certain other items in accrued. I cannot believe I\u2019m actually asking you a cash flow or a balance sheet question, but there was a certainly\u2026\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay.\nKash Rangan: \u2026a big number that boosted the free cash flow, I think, it was prepaid and accrued liabilities or something that looked a little big and contributed to the jump in otherwise what would have been still a great free cash flow quarter? Just curious what that one-time item seem to be?\nKelly Steckelberg: In the \u2013 let me just pull up the balance sheet.\nKash Rangan: It was \u2013 yes, we can follow-up offline if needed\u2026\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay.\nKash Rangan: \u2026but it was a fairly large item that stood up in the cash flow statement.\nKelly Steckelberg: When we have our call back later, Kash, let\u2019s talk about it then.\nKash Rangan: Yes, wonderful. It\u2019s accrued expense and other liabilities, a big jump there. Well, we can talk about it later.\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay.\nKash Rangan: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Kash.\nTom McCallum: Thanks. Next question please, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Meta, you are unmuted.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Just wanted to ask if, I know that Zoom Voice has kind of initially been targeted at customers as kind of an add-on once they are already onboard. But if you\u2019re seeing more interest upfront from customers wanting video and voice at the same time. And then maybe just as a follow-up question for Kelly. So just a little bit more rationale for the gross margin outperformance and just some of the factors there? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Eric, you want to take the question about the Zoom Phone?\nEric Yuan: Yes, go ahead. Yes.\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay. So in terms of the gross margin, Meta, what we saw is obviously outperformance on the top line without additional expansion needs in this quarter in the data center, as well as we saw outperformance \u2013 or sorry, improvements in both our third-party audio costs, as well as our professional services margins. What you will expect is in Q4, remember, as a reminder, because we run our own servers in these co-located facilities, whenever we add servers, it was kind of step function into the expense. So that\u2019s why we are guiding for that to be in line, but you\u2019ll see a slight tick in terms of Q4 for \u2013 from a gross margin perspective as we\u2019re going to make some further investments in servers.\nEric Yuan: Okay.\nKelly Steckelberg: And then, Eric, do you want to talk about the strategy about continuing to focus on Zoom Phone for our existing customers?\nEric Yuan: Yes, for sure, because over the past several years, a lot of our our existing installed base, they told us they are still using a traditional legacy PBX solution. They would like to move to one unified solution. That\u2019s why it\u2019s still our top priority to focus on our existing installed base, because those customers already understand video conferencing or we already build a trust relationship. I think that\u2019s low-hanging fruit, that\u2019s our top priority. And inside of that, for sure, down the road, we are going to open up the Zoom Phone service to the greenfield as well, and that\u2019s the next growth opportunity for us in FY 2021 and the future as well.\nTom McCallum: Okay. Thank you, Meta.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom from Stifel. Tom, you are unmuted now.\nTom Roderick: Thank you for taking my questions. Greetings from Chicago. Things go softly nice out there. Good work. Eric, I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the international opportunity. It\u2019s obviously a huge opportunity and it\u2019s still pretty small relative to the overall size of your business. On that topic, how ready is the market to really expand kind of wall to wall on Zoom as you look at international prospects? And then can you talk a little bit more about go-to-market? How easy is it to hire sales reps? How do you want to build those territories out? Just an update on what you\u2019re seeing in Europe and APAC? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Yes, sure. Absolutely. So if you look at it revenue-wise, a rise of 20%, but the growth rate is much higher 97% last quarter. And we\u2019re already doubling \u2013 we\u2019re already doubling down our expansion in Amsterdam, and \u2013 which is our headquarter for the EMEA. We hire a lot of people over there. I think if you look at opportunities, especially for the video conferencing, I think the market is ready. We just need to hire more people, have enough leads. And however, if you look at the phone service, for sure, we are going to add more and more international coverage, and I think that\u2019s another opportunity. But probably we are going to play a different game. Here, we focus on the video for us and obviously phone. For international, video and voice at the same time. I think probably we\u2019ll see accelerated growth for customers to deploy both video and voice at the same time, not only for the EMEA, but also APAC as well, like in Japan, Australia, I think the two greater countries where we see the huge opportunity.\nTom Roderick: Outstanding. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you. I like the opportunity back one.\nTom McCallum: Yes.\nEric Yuan: We should go there.\nTom McCallum: Yes. Next question please, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan from Stephens. Ryan, you are unmuted.\nRyan MacWilliams: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. So, Eric, can you briefly mention about any updates to improving the global service coverage for Zoom Phone? And have you seen the enterprises waiting to expand Zoom Phone licenses until in-country service coverage becomes available?\nEric Yuan: That\u2019s a good question. Actually, we\u2019re in the process to support more and more countries, because we shared our road map about which country we are going to support with customers transparently. We really like that. We are going to support U.S., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. And those countries, end of this calendar year, early January, we are going to support a bunch of other countries, specifically in Europe. And also in Q1 next year, we\u2019re going to support a lot of countries in APAC. I think we are going to roll out the services on more and more countries, I think, in the next several months. And the customer, they are not going to say, \u201cHey, I want to win for this country or that country as not \u2013 as we show their road map.\u201d I think on the customers, they feel very confident.\nRyan MacWilliams: And many UCaaS providers struggle to achieve local service coverage in China and India. Is this something to be possible for Zoom over next few years?\nEric Yuan: Oh, not in the next few years, it\u2019s the next several months, actually. We are making very, very good progress. I think that multinational customers whose office is probably in China, we already can support to like support the China local network. India was making good progress and so soon we should support both India and China. Well, if we wait for several years, we are going to have problems. So we feel very comfortable to support both India and China very soon.\nRyan MacWilliams: All right. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Hey, Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex from RBC. Alex, you are unmuted.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you hear me?\nTom McCallum: Yes. Go right ahead, Alex.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. So maybe first one for Kelly. If I look \u2013 this is kind of going on Sterling\u2019s question. If I look at the current RPO growth and the current RPO bookings growth, they\u2019re both sequentially and year-over-year much stronger than billings growth rate. So I\u2019m just curious, were there any kind of one-time impact? I saw the long-term deferred fell off a little bit more this quarter. So are there any impacts that\u2019s causing that disparity? And which one of those is a much \u2013 is a better metric for your forward revenue?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So as a quick reminder, unlike many other SaaS companies, unfortunately, in either RPO or billings is a great metric for us, as we still have a large percentage of our customer base that both bill and contract on a monthly basis. So this makes it very difficult to use a metric that\u2019s comparative to other SaaS businesses. What you\u2019re seeing is that, because of this high \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of month-to-month, because we don\u2019t incent either our customers or our sales reps to move to annual, because we still have such a high retention rate that is \u2013 but we are seeing slowly as we continue to move up-market, some of those customers move more and more to the annual. But, again, it\u2019s just really not a great metric for us fortunately.\nAlex Zukin: Okay, understood. And then maybe just on the topic of your new \u2013 your recently \u2013 maybe not so recent anymore, Ryan Azus. Maybe, Eric, what are the changes that you\u2019re seeing kind of him makes a go-to-market organization? Are you kind of there with your hiring plans as you look into the fourth quarter and exit the year from a sales rep perspective? And maybe what are just kind of two or three most important priorities?\nEric Yuan: Yes, sure. So yes, we hired Ryan several months ago, because we know Ryan well and he\u2019s a good friend. And we really \u2013 we feel very excited to work together again. In terms of series of changes actually, he is working on \u2013 first of all, in more enterprise, international, the Zoom Phone expansion. And for us, next year probably, we also want to leverage our in-channel program more, right? Looking at the discipline, it\u2019s by and large primarily driven by our direct sales force. As we expand our base to international for the phone, I think, especially for the \u2013 looking at phone base probably in the hardware as well. I think that to support a much better channel program, certainly can help us, and Ryan and his team, they\u2019re working on that.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Alex.\nTom McCallum: Thank you. Next question please, Matt?\nOperator: Our next question is from Zane from Bernstein. Zane, you are unmuted. Hey, Zane, are you there?\nTom McCallum: Yes, he seem unmute still.\nZane Chrane: Okay, sorry about that.\nTom McCallum: No worries, Zane.\nZane Chrane: Good to see you, guys. Congrats on a great quarter and thanks for fitting me in. So I wanted to dig into kind of the expansion profile of the large customers, maybe I know you guys talked about the net expansion rate of being over 130% for six consecutive quarters. But on an individual customer level looking over a long-term time horizon, what can we kind of expect that growth in participants using Zoom or growth in host using Zoom to look like? Because I looked at the Walmart example, where they switched from WebEx to Zoom. It looks like within about a one-year period of making that transition, there were 50% more people participating in videoconferences. What does that look like over \u2013 look like over a two or three-year or four-year timeframe?\nEric Yuan: So first of all, if you look at the typical large enterprise customers, very likely, they started from a small footprint, right? They grow video conferencing, and because it just works, we see in the next several quarters after we deploy the video conferencing, we\u2019ve seen more and more host license. At the same time, we\u2019re going to up-sell the Zoom Phone as well. And ultimately, the goal is to do a deal like HSBC, the entire workforce that can standardize on Zoom platform.  That\u2019s why today, when you look at Fortune 100 companies, if you look at all those companies, so many companies, they are our customer, however, not for the entire company, right? That\u2019s why huge opportunity to up-sell both video conference license as well as phone license. That\u2019s our growth strategy for enterprise, not like on DRAM, hey, you got to deploy Zoom across the entire organization. We like to get a small footprint and grow our business over there. That\u2019s our growth strategy for large enterprise customers.\nZane Chrane: That makes sense. And is there an example you can point to where a customer has continued growing 40%, 50% annually for multiple years? And what can we kind of expect that increase in the TAM to look like due to the higher-quality and, in fact, for the self-service?\nEric Yuan: I think that AB is one of the good examples recently, right? They started with video conferencing, end up more video license and also deployed the Zoom Phone as well. This is a good example.\nTom McCallum: More Zoom Rooms, too.\nEric Yuan: Yes, more \u2013 yes, you\u2019re right. More Zoom Rooms as well. yes.\nZane Chrane: Yes I reference our parent company, AB, all the time. So I was hoping for more examples there. But yes, we\u2019ve loved it. So it\u2019s been great. Thank you, guys.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you. Hey, Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex from KeyBanc. Alex, you are unmuted.\nEric Yuan: Alex, you are unmated.\nAlex Kurtz: Can you hear me now?\nEric Yuan: Yes, we can.\nAlex Kurtz: Is that better? Great. Sorry about that. So, Eric, when you think about your top 50 phone deals in the pipeline looking into Q4 and into the first-half of next year, how dependent are those top deals on the international regulatory approval that you talked about in Zoomtopia? And then I have a question for Kelly.\nEric Yuan: I think if you look at our pipeline at the top, the Zoom Phone customers, I think it\u2019s still like primarily driven by the multinational companies, which are headquartered here\u2026\nAlex Kurtz: Right.\nEric Yuan: \u2026in the U.S. or Canada. However, as they deploy Zoom Phone for the entire organization, they probably, this start of \u2013 normally, they have multiple traditional legacy, the PBX systems, right? They probably started replacing a lot of stuff. That\u2019s why as long as we share with our road map, our international coverage, they feel very confident, because we already support multiple countries over the very short period of time. And I think for the customer like AB is one example, in APAC, we do see a lot of opportunity in APAC. They want to deploy video and a phone at the same time. When you look at the top deals, still like our existing installed base, because, look, most of our big enterprise customers are based in the U.S. So I think that\u2019s the opportunity.\nAlex Kurtz: So the initial big phone deployments, they\u2019ll start in the U.S. then go into international markets as you guys get approval?\nEric Yuan: Yes, that\u2019s right, step-by-step. Yes.\nAlex Kurtz: Okay. And then Kelly, just assumptions on the Zoom Phone impact on gross margin, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s having much yet. But as we look into Q4 in the first part of next year, how should we be thinking about that?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So when we model Zoom Phone on a standalone basis, it does have a gross margin that\u2019s three to four whole points lower than the Zoom Meetings. As you said right now, given the overall contribution it\u2019s not having any impact on the gross margin. And what we\u2019re really focused on is continuously improving those gross margins. So that by the time it does become a more material part of our results, that ideally we\u2019ll have improved the gross margin, so that it\u2019s very close to equal. But I\u2026\nAlex Kurtz: Okay.\nKelly Steckelberg: \u2026right in the middle of doing FY 2021 planning right now. And so we\u2019ll be giving further outlook on that in the Q4 call.\nAlex Kurtz: Okay. All right. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yes. So, Alex, yes, sorry, just to add on to what Kelly said, if you look at the gross margin, because we did not build the Zoom Phone system from the ground-up, because we share most of the back-end architecture when we build a video conferencing system. That\u2019s why we share the same server, same back-end. I think from a cost perspective, we can really leverage the existing infrastructure.\nAlex Kurtz: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Alex. Next question please, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bhavan from William Blair. Bhavan, you should be unmated now.\nBhavan Suri: Can you hear me, okay?\nEric Yuan: Yes, we can.\nBhavan Suri: I think we saw computer thing and I don\u2019t have Tom\u2019s background in Chicago. I have a cold on the dark winter in Chicago. Tom, I guess, I had a \u2013 first, a fairly broader sort of strategic question here for Eric. So we all know collaboration is converging. And obviously, video, voice, text, e-mail, that whole idea of this convergence of how you communicate internally with customers, the real-time nature of channels, you\u2019re partnered with some of these players. As you think about ten years from now, not next quarter, not next year, but ten years from now, where do you think you are in that collaboration space? It can\u2019t just be voice and video. So how do you think about that picture long-term?\nEric Yuan: That\u2019s a good question. By the way, I can really held wider board now. And even if you do not have which background, so.\nBhavan Suri: It\u2019s not that exciting [indiscernible], not that exciting at all.\nEric Yuan: That\u2019s a right answer on the wider board, I cannot tell anything at the moment. Anyway, so if you look out to 30 years, I think, first of all, we look at it based on IDC estimates. We look at it by 2021, the unified cloud communication market are already $43 billion, right? That\u2019s a huge market. I think for us, especially, we\u2019ve started from video conferencing, we do the new voice. Next several years, I think three or four, five years, that\u2019s still our top priority because we have to be the number one market leader on many fronts, right? And the 30 years are, you\u2019re right, so there are two trends. One trend is the best-of-breed service. Like today, we are still seeing that\u2019s a trend. Best-of-breed service providers will do very well, like video voice at Zoom and like Slack and Okta, I think will do very well. Another trend is the customer, they might want to deploy one unified solution from one company, but I do not see that model sustainable. Because quite often, when you have a problem from \u2013 for web service, you\u2019re stuck. That\u2019s why I think in the future, as we focus on video and voice, we might spend more time on technology side, AI or real-time language translation. I shake hands with you, you can feel that as well. And for us, more integration with other service providers are the best-of-breed service. I think together, I think we can grow the business together. I do not see any single vendor try and grow their business by adding all those point solutions by themselves. I do not see that sustainable, plus customers, they do not like that either.\nBhavan Suri: Yes, fair enough. And then on the Zoom App Marketplace, you said that could obviously be a place to highlight opportunities you may not necessarily have thought of in terms of how to expand the offering and things like that. Just an update on the traction of the Marketplace? What kind of early opportunities you\u2019ve been able to identify there? Would love to get some color on how that\u2019s trending and how it\u2019s going vis-\u00e0-vis new use cases? Last year, Jira Service Desk came from Jira\u2019s Marketplace, would love to see how you think about that? Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yes. So as of last month, we had over 150 applications built upon our platform, like some that are gone and other \u2013 the Chorus, right, they focus on the sales analytics, right, and build integration upon our platform. We see a lot of new applications like from health care as well, online education. And I think next several quarters, we probably will see some accelerated growth for our marketplace. To get to the first 100 applications really hard. But now we are \u2013 already have 150. I think we\u2019ll be able to see more and more vertical applications build upon our platform.\nBhavan Suri: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: And \u2013 yes.\nBhavan Suri: Sorry, go ahead.\nEric Yuan: Sorry, I forgot to mention one thing, at Zoomtopia, our existing investors like Sequoia, Emergence Capital and \u2013 they all established a fund, right, try to help us to kind invest into those third-party companies to build service upon our platform.\nBhavan Suri: Well, I\u2019m hoping they\u2019re thinking of a nice exit, too, aren\u2019t they? Anyway, thank you for answering my questions and congratulations.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you. Next question please, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Will from Baird. Will, you\u2019re unmated.\nWill Power: Yes. Great, thanks. Yes. So just a question \u2013 two questions here. So first on the Quinnipiac win, which looked like a nice additional win for Phone. I think you\u2019ve referenced in the prepared remarks need to enhance some of the features. Maybe just provide a little more color as to what you need to do there? What are some of the other key pieces of feedback that you\u2019re getting from Phone customers in terms of needed enhancements? And when do you expect kind of be full throttle, I guess, Eric, on the phone feature set front?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So first of all, after the customer tested our phone service, I can tell you, they all like our service. But only two things. I think probably if we have a look through today, we\u2019ll have a conservative growth, but we are going to get there very soon. Ryan \u2013 we already mentioned and briefly touched on that, it\u2019s just the international coverage, and it\u2019s just more like it will take sometime. There\u2019s no technology challenge, right? Just you need to go through sometimes local regulation like India and China and also more tests, right? That\u2019s one area. Another area just like in some of the features and I assume most of the time, we do not use those features. But for customers who signed a contract, we\u2019re still going to make sure adding those features. I\u2019ll give you two examples, like SMS. I think it\u2019s not that critical. But unfortunately, some customers say, we probably still need that. We are going to support that very soon. Like another feature probably and never used that feature called a park, right? And some of the customers still want to have that feature regardless they use it or not, right? All of those, I think, ton of features, we are going to get there very soon. It\u2019s not very hard. It\u2019s just going to take sometime.\nWill Power: Okay. Yes, I guess the other question kind of along those lines, probably more than just feature. At Zoomtopia, you talked about some additional contact center partnerships. Maybe update us as to how that\u2019s going? And as you start to have more Zoom Phone wins, how often is contact center coming out in conversation? How important is that to have alongside you?\nEric Yuan: Yes, yes. So our strategy is \u2013 we also shared at Zoomtopia as well. We would like to partner with other cloud-based, contact center solutions, like Five9 is a good example, right? Rowan, who really understand the collaboration market, we have a wonderful partnership, and quite often, customer share their innovation about the full, contact center, we \u2013 bringing our team and also Five9 team as well. And having said that, we also \u2013 because we have open platform, also integrate with other contract center solutions as well because some of the customers, they already deploy other cloud business solutions, like inContact, right, or maybe Talkdesk or maybe Twilio solution. That\u2019s why we also needed to integrate as well.\nWill Power: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Vinod from Oppenheimer. Vinod, you are unmuted down.\nVinod Srinivasaraghavan: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I want to touch on, on your FedRAMP opportunity. I believe you said USPS was your first agency win. How is your pipeline looking there? And when do you think that could really become meaningful for you guys?\nEric Yuan: For us to win big in the public sector, two things. One thing is, for sure, we need to have a FedRAMP approval, right? Obviously, this was done early this year in May. Another thing is make sure our back-end side, we have a special \u2013 the infrastructure and we call it the Zoom Government Cloud, right? And over the past several months, we also made a very good progress. USPS is first customer. I mean a big customer provision for the Zoom Government Cloud, because our infrastructure is also very ready and downloaded for every feature, not only do this for enterprise commercial cloud, but also, by default, we also support the government cloud. We would say, you see, look at the pipeline is pretty strong. I think we are \u2013 finally, I think we\u2019re ready now.\nVinod Srinivasaraghavan: Great. Okay, great. Thanks. And just one question on the expansion rate. I believe I calculated to be about 133% this quarter versus about 137% last quarter. How do we think about expansion rate trends going forward, given your ability to up-sell Phones and up-sell Rooms into some of your larger customers?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Kelly, you\u2019re unmuted.\nTom McCallum: Yes.\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay, here I\u2019m. Thanks, Vinod. So really, it\u2019s \u2013 as a reminder, as we\u2019re continuing to move more and more up-market, we see a great opportunity for the expansion rate to stay strong and/or continue to improve. It might vary quarter-to-quarter, which is why what we gave is that 130%, because it can vary depending on timing of deal and we can\u2019t really manage that. We don\u2019t manage to it. And so I don\u2019t want there to be noise around this number as it moves up and down as we point quarter-to-quarter. But we feel really great about a really strong retention rate.\nVinod Srinivasaraghavan: Okay, great. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yep.\nTom McCallum: Hey, Matt, do we have any more questions?\nOperator: That was actually our last question from our analysts today.\nEric Yuan: I didn\u2019t see Pat Walravens out there. Did he drop-off unfortunately?\nOperator: No, I do see him, but I don\u2019t see his audio connected. So I can\u2019t actually have him talk and ask the question yet.\nEric Yuan: Okay.\nTom McCallum: Next time.\nEric Yuan: Next time. Sorry, Pat. We\u2019ll get you on the next time.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, perhaps, I think Pat is just on a different number, up above, do you see?\nOperator: Oh, does it end in 111?\nKelly Steckelberg: I see him on an audio right above his \u2013 okay. We can grab him in the after calls.\nTom McCallum: Yes. Sorry about that, Pat.\nEric Yuan: Hold on. Let\u2019s try one more time, if he\u2019s connected to audio now. Pat, are you on?\nKelly Steckelberg: Eric, yes.\nPat Walravens: Yes. I\u2019m on. Forgive me for the background noise. What you can\u2019t see from the virtual background is me boarding my flight. Okay, Eric, what\u2019s going to be the hardest part for me to scale in terms of keeping customers happy as you scale, what\u2019s the hardest part?\nEric Yuan: I think to keep existing customer happy is really important and really hard, because they request more and more features. And we try to do \u2013 we also try to grow our business to have new customers. But for now, our top priority is to focus on existing customers and make sure they\u2019re very happy. This is pretty hard.\nPat Walravens: Okay. And then another thing that seems really important is the Zoomtopia was the The appliances. Can you tell us why everyone was so excited about that?\nEric Yuan: So, we listen to our customers\u2019 customer. They would like to, if not for every customer, we have a lot of customer. They already deployed our existing Zoom Rooms based on the Mac or Windows really like that experience. But for some of the customers, they may not have enough IT resources. They would like to have a simplified deployment model, where they get an appliance, tell the power and hook up the network, everything should work. They wanted to gather their service from web vendors, from Zoom, right? That\u2019s why we partnered with those, Poly and Neat and Logitech and DTEN and other Crestron. And essentially, we offer the appliance to customer to simplify the deployment, some of the customer really likes that model so.\nPat Walravens: Okay. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Pat.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thanks a lot.\nTom McCallum: Hey, Matt, I think I see Ryan Koontz raised his hand. I don\u2019t know if you can reach out to him.\nOperator: Certainly. Ryan, let me go ahead and just unmute your mic. Ryan, you\u2019re unmated.\nRyan Koontz: Great. Thank you very much for putting me in. If you could drill down a little on Zoom Rooms a little bit, please? And where do you expect early adoption there? How important is that for enterprise penetration? And how is that going to roll out to sales in terms of sales and partner enablement, you could talk about that, please? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Yes, sure. So Zoom Rooms is, I would say, very important, very strategic to our growth because customer for sure enjoy Zoom for laptop, with desktop, with mobile. Quite often, they have important meetings. They might be tired in the conf room. But today, lots of enterprise customers very like to be \u2013 they still deploy old legacy, traditional video conference solutions, very hard to maintain. That\u2019s why customers, on the one hand, we do support those traditional hardware devices very well, we can incorporate very well. On the other hand, those enterprise customers, they like cloud-based solutions, meaning just a video interport and all the software air sourcing should connect \u2013 should be connected back to the cloud. We see almost every enterprise customer, they are very interested. You do not want to maintain a very complex video infrastructure. And because of that, we \u2013 that we just touch on that in Zoom Rooms Appliance Program, try to simplify that experience. We offer the appliance to customer, very easy to deploy. Plus, the customers also want to have simplified the invoice as well, like hardware service. Overall, I think a customer really likes the Zoom Rooms. We want to make sure simplify the deployment, simplify the building as well. So that\u2019s our focus in the next several quarters.\nRyan Koontz: Got it. Thank you. Helpful.\nEric Yuan: Thank you. Anyone else?\nOperator: Should have been our last question from our analysts today, actually.\nTom McCallum: Yes. I do want to end the call.\nEric Yuan: In closing, first of all thank you for your time. I really appreciate and thank you all the Zoom employees. Thank you for your hard work and see you next quarter. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, everybody.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you. Bye.\nTom McCallum: Bye. Thank you.",

            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone joining us. Let me start by first reviewing the financial results for Q3 and then I will discuss our outlook for Q4 and the full fiscal year. Overall, we delivered another amazing quarter and demand for Zoom's unified communication platform remained strong across our major geographies and offerings. Total revenue grew 85% year-over-year in the third quarter to $167 million. This top line result exceeded the high-end of our guidance range. Key drivers of our revenue performance included both our acquisition of new customers and expansion of Zoom's footprint within existing customers. Specifically, new customers accounted for approximately 61% of our year-over-year growth in subscription revenue, while the remaining 39% was due to additional purchases from existing customers. Now, let me share some of the key customer metrics for Q3. Our two-pronged strategy of land and expand continued to drive growth. First, we added 7,800 customers with more than 10 employees in the period and exited Q3 with over 74,100 customers, up 67% year-over-year. Our continued expansion in the up-market resulted in 546 customers with more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue, up 97% year-over-year. This is an increase of 80 customers and a record number of adds in a quarter. Our ability to expand with existing customers was evident in our net dollar expansion rate that was over 130% for the sixth consecutive quarter. Our net dollar expansion rate remains at the top tier of our industry and reflects the high level of satisfaction and trust that customers have in Zoom. This is further evidenced by our Net Promoter Score, which remained above 70 in Q3. Eric discussed two examples of how this strategy contributed to our Q3 results and let me give you a third one. During the quarter, we had an expanded commitment from Quinnipiac University, a nationally-ranked private university in Connecticut with over 10,000 students. The university originally moved to Zoom Meetings based on the ease of use and reliability of the technology, as well as a way to consolidate into one platform for their diverse community of users. Looking to drive further adoption of an innovative communications platform, the university has also selected Zoom Phone to modernize their phone system. The University has been a great partner and applauded Zoom's willingness to work with the university to enhance the feature sets of our technology on their journey toward a unified communications platform. Next, as we discussed at our recent Analyst Day, international expansion is a key multi-year growth initiative for Zoom. In Q3, our APAC and EMEA revenue combined grew 98% year-over-year and represented approximately 20% of revenue. Revenue from the Americas was up 82% year-over-year and represented approximately 80% of revenue. We see significant opportunity ahead for international expansion. Now turning to profitability. Our sales execution in Q3 also helped drive strong growth in our profitability and free cash flow. We were net income profitable from both a GAAP and a non-GAAP perspective, but today, I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and related share-based equity taxes. Non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 82.9%, compared to 81.7% in Q3 last year and 82.2% last quarter. For the full-year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be at the top-end of our long-term target of 80% to 82%. R&D expense in Q3 was approximately $14 million, up 64% on a year-over-year basis. As Eric discussed, we announced several expansions to our platform at Zoomtopia. We continue to invest in innovating our platform with our highly efficient R&D model. Given our hiring plans over the next several quarters, we expect R&D to return to the top end of the range of 10% to 12%, which is consistent with our long term view. Sales and marketing expense for Q3 was $82 million. This reflects an increase of 58%, or $30 million over last year with investments in initiatives to drive further growth. As a percent of total revenue, sales and marketing was 49%, lower than Q3 last year, but up from Q2 due to Zoomtopia. We expect to generate a great return on investment in this area and we expect to increase hiring for international up-market growth initiatives in Q4 and into FY 2021. G&A expense in Q3 was $21 million and represented 12% of total revenue. This compares to last quarter and last year, which both were 12% of total revenue. Non-GAAP operating income was $21 million, translating to a 13% non-GAAP operating margin for the quarter. This was an increase of approximately $19 million, as compared to Q3's last \u2013 Q3 last year's result of $2 million. The main driver of this result was the higher revenue, while spending was mostly in line with our expectations. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q3 was $0.09, on approximately 293 million of non-GAAP, weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.06 higher than our guidance and $0.08 higher than Q3 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended Q3 with approximately $811 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $202 million, up 89% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, totaled approximately $517 million, up 102% from $256 million last year. We expect to recognize approximately 64%, or $330 million of the total RPO as revenue in the next 12 months, as compared to 65%, or $166 million in Q3 last year. Current RPO was up 99% year-over-year, the same growth rate as Q2's current RPO. Non-current RPO was up 108% year-over-year. Our execution led to strong cash flow growth. Operating cash flow was $62 million in Q3, up from $18 million, or 240% year-over-year. In Q3, free cash flow was $55 million, up from $10 million, or 440% year-over-year growth. As we discussed on last quarter's webinar, the benefit we received over the last two quarters from the Employee Stock Purchase Plan will become a use of cash in Q4 when the first purchase will be made. The quarter-over-quarter outflow in cash related to ESPP will be approximately $20 million in Q4. Starting in FY 2021, we expect the cadence of benefits from contributions to the ESPP to occur in Q1 and Q3 and net outflows from purchases to occur in Q2 and Q4. Now turning to guidance. We are pleased to be increasing our outlook for the full-year based on our view of the current business environment, our ability to gain market share and the momentum we have achieved so far this year. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $175 million to $176 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $17 million to $18 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.07, based on approximately 296 million shares outstanding. For the full-year of fiscal 2020, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $609 million to $610 million, up from our prior guidance of $587 million to $590 million. This would be approximately 85% year-over-year growth. For the full-year, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $67 million to $68 million, an increase of approximately 50% from the top-end of our prior guidance of $42 million to $45 million. With this meaningful increase in profitability, we now expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.27 for the full-year fiscal 2020, based on approximately 293 million shares outstanding. In closing, we are pleased with our progress this year and our unique ability to deliver high growth at scale, combined with profitability and free cash flow growth. I would also like to thank the entire Zoom team for their hard work in Q3. We are well-positioned to end the year strong as we stay focused on delivering happiness to our customers every day. With that, let's open it up for questions. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue up our first question. Hi, Brad. Brad, they wouldn't take me. We certainly are committed to investing as much as possible in terms of continuing to drive growth in the top line. And we expect to see hiring to actually accelerate in Q4. So you should see our headcount numbers for the end of the year to finish really strong, as well as \u2013 Janine has seen a lot of progress in terms of efficiency and marketing. So we continue to look for opportunistic ways to add, but ensuring that we continue to produce a high ROI on any of our marketing spend. Thank you, Sterling. Hi. So you got it exactly right. What we're seeing is a couple of things, is that a lot of our seasonality is for renewals is lining up to be July and January. Due to the nature of our six-month quarter for our teams, as well as, as we continue to move more and more up-market, we're seeing a shift with those customers that deals with those customers to shift more and more, not only to the back-end of the year, but also to the back-end of the quarter, which is exactly what's driving that. Okay. In the \u2013 let me just pull up the balance sheet. Okay. When we have our call back later, Kash, let's talk about it then. Okay. Thank you. Eric, you want to take the question about the Zoom Phone? Okay. So in terms of the gross margin, Meta, what we saw is obviously outperformance on the top line without additional expansion needs in this quarter in the data center, as well as we saw outperformance \u2013 or sorry, improvements in both our third-party audio costs, as well as our professional services margins. What you will expect is in Q4, remember, as a reminder, because we run our own servers in these co-located facilities, whenever we add servers, it was kind of step function into the expense. So that's why we are guiding for that to be in line, but you'll see a slight tick in terms of Q4 for \u2013 from a gross margin perspective as we're going to make some further investments in servers. And then, Eric, do you want to talk about the strategy about continuing to focus on Zoom Phone for our existing customers? Yes. So as a quick reminder, unlike many other SaaS companies, unfortunately, in either RPO or billings is a great metric for us, as we still have a large percentage of our customer base that both bill and contract on a monthly basis. So this makes it very difficult to use a metric that's comparative to other SaaS businesses. What you're seeing is that, because of this high \u2013 there's a lot of month-to-month, because we don't incent either our customers or our sales reps to move to annual, because we still have such a high retention rate that is \u2013 but we are seeing slowly as we continue to move up-market, some of those customers move more and more to the annual. But, again, it's just really not a great metric for us fortunately. Yes. So when we model Zoom Phone on a standalone basis, it does have a gross margin that's three to four whole points lower than the Zoom Meetings. As you said right now, given the overall contribution it's not having any impact on the gross margin. And what we're really focused on is continuously improving those gross margins. So that by the time it does become a more material part of our results, that ideally we'll have improved the gross margin, so that it's very close to equal. But I... ...right in the middle of doing FY 2021 planning right now. And so we'll be giving further outlook on that in the Q4 call. Okay, here I'm. Thanks, Vinod. So really, it's \u2013 as a reminder, as we're continuing to move more and more up-market, we see a great opportunity for the expansion rate to stay strong and/or continue to improve. It might vary quarter-to-quarter, which is why what we gave is that 130%, because it can vary depending on timing of deal and we can't really manage that. We don't manage to it. And so I don't want there to be noise around this number as it moves up and down as we point quarter-to-quarter. But we feel really great about a really strong retention rate. Yep. So, perhaps, I think Pat is just on a different number, up above, do you see? I see him on an audio right above his \u2013 okay. We can grab him in the after calls. Eric, yes. Thank you. Bye."

Joining me today will be Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan; and Zoom\u2019s CFO Kelly Steckelberg Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and maybe downloaded from the Investor Relations page on the zoom.com website. Also on this page, we are able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings press release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and other future events or trends, including guidance. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results and which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today\u2019s earnings press release and our latest 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we may make on today\u2019s call. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Tom. Thank you and welcome to everyone joining us on today\u2019s Zoom webinar. I am very pleased to report that we had a remarkable second quarter and continued to deliver a unique combination of high growth with increased profitability and a free cash flow. As Kelly will discuss in a moment, the first half momentum in our business has enabled us to meaningfully raise our revenue and profitability outlook for the rest of the year. Our strong second quarter results are evidence that organizations are turning to Zoom as a strategic technology partner to help them improve their communications and collaboration. While we continue to attract customers of all sizes and across several industry segments, let\u2019s discuss one of our largest wins of the quarter. I am proud to the welcome HSBC to the Zoom family. HSBC is one of the largest financial services organizations in the world with over 3,900 offices in 67 countries. HSBC will standardize on Zoom platform by deploying to 290,000 hosts and to 5,500 conference rooms. HSBC will consolidate onto Zoom\u2019s video-first unified communications platform for both internal and external meetings. By standardizing on Zoom, HSBC we will consolidate costs and create an enhanced, frictionless experience for end users. This enterprise-wide deployment represents one of the largest customer commitments to Zoom in our history and reflects our growing momentum with global customers. HSBC, I love you. My wife switched to HSBC credit card, so. Now, let me discuss two more business highlights from Q2. First, we announced a new partnership with Verizon Business Group to offer Zoom to its global customers. Zoom's platform is available as a cloud service enabling a variety of HSBC customers to ensure reliable and innovative video communications. This agreement with Verizon is a great example of our strategy to partner with top global service providers to extend the reach of Zoom around the world. The new service is available on Verizon's network and their sales teams are already trained and enabled to sell Zoom. And second, Ryan Azus joined Zoom as our Chief Revenue Officer. Ryan has already -- has nearly 20 years of selling experience and sales leadership in the communications industry. He spent the past nine years at RingCentral, where he was most recently the Executive Vice President of Sales and Services. Ryan was instrumental in building the company's field sales and channel organizations from the ground up. Prior to RingCentral, Ryan was a sales leader at Cisco WebEx for over nine years. I've had the pleasure of working with Ryan previously and he has an incredible acumen for building and leading world-class revenue organizations. In closing, I would like to thank the 2,200 Zoom employees around the globe for their commitment to customer happiness, which sets the foundation for delivering the type of strong financial results that we are sharing for our second quarter and first half of fiscal 2020. We will continue to stay focused across the company on the happiness of customers and building trust with them. By helping our customers to succeed with a frictionless communications platform, we are very well positioned to increase our market share and deliver remarkable results. With that, let me turn things over to Kelly\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Let me start by first reviewing financial results for Q2. And then I will discuss our outlook for Q3 and the full fiscal year. Total revenue grew 96% year-over-year in the second quarter, to $146 million. This top line result exceeded the high-end of our guidance range and had a positive impact on our profitability and free cash flow. Similar to last quarter, we executed very well in a strong demand environment for the Zoom platform. This execution was represented broadly across our major geographies and offerings. Key drivers of our revenue performance included both our acquisition of new customers and expansion of Zoom\u2019s footprint within existing customers. Specifically, new customers accounted for approximately 61% of our year-over-year growth in subscription revenue while the remaining 39% was due to additional purchases from existing customers. Here are some key customer metrics from Q2. We exited the quarter with over 66,300 customers with more than 10 employees, up 78% year-over-year. This is a record number of new customer additions in a quarter. One of our key verticals is the Financial Services sector. I am pleased to share with you that we are experiencing strong success in this segment with firms like HSBC, Moody's and Morgan Stanley becoming Zoom customers in Q2. The combination of our land and expand strategy, along with our continued up-market focus, resulted in Q2 ending with 466 customers with more than $100,000 in revenue over the last 12 months, this is up 104% year-over-year. This also led to a net dollar expansion rate that was over 130% for the 5th consecutive quarter as customers are deploying more Zoom products and adding more licenses within their organization. One example was a significant expansion with a large luxury brand. This customer began their relationship with Zoom last year and quickly deployed Zoom meetings to approximately 3,800 users to replace their legacy video conferencing provider. Because of their trust in Zoom, they then invited us to provide a modern solution for the phone service in their corporate offices and stores. After a comprehensive evaluation, they selected Zoom Phone in Q2. They cited call quality, ease of use, cost savings, and the unified Zoom platform of meetings, chat and phone as important benefits to their organization. They have already begun the rollout of 4,700 Zoom Phone licenses within their organization. The customer also plans to roll out Zoom Phone to their 750 domestic retail stores starting in early 2020 and rest of the world soon thereafter. This is an exciting win for us and it demonstrates the potential to upsell technologies when you make existing customers happy and build trust. Geographic expansion is another driver of our revenue growth as we continue to deliver strong growth internationally. In Q2, our APAC and EMEA revenue combined grew a 115% year-over-year and represented approximately 20% of revenue. Revenue from the Americas was up 91% year-over-year and represented approximately 80% of revenue. This high revenue growth and strategic customer wins are evidence that our investments to expand our global footprint are succeeding. Now turning to profitability. Here you can see we were profitable from both a GAAP and non-GAAP perspective, but I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense, and related share-based equity taxes. Non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 82.2%, compared to 82.8% in Q2 of year and 80.9% last quarter. For the full-year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of our long-term target of 80% to 82% as we continue to scale our infrastructure to support our growth. R&D expense in Q2 was approximately $13 million, up 83% on a year-over-year basis. We expect to continue to invest in innovating our platform and see R&D returning to the range of 10% to 12% of revenue which is consistent with our long-term view. Sales and marketing expense for Q2 was $69 million. This reflects an increase of 70% or $28 million over last year with investments in initiatives to drive further growth. As a percent of total revenue, Sales and Marketing was 47%, lower than Q2 last year as we have seen some efficiency gains in marketing. Looking forward, we expect to continue to invest in this area especially to drive international and up market growth. G&A expense in Q2 was $18 million and represented 12% of total revenue. This result represents our continued investment to support our status as a publicly traded company. Non-GAAP operating income was $21 million translating to a 14.2% non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter. This was an improvement of 812 basis points as compared to Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q2 was $0.08, on approximately 292 million of non-GAAP, weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.06 higher than the high end of our guidance and $0.06 higher than Q2 of last year due to the outperformance in the quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with approximately $755 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $181 million, up 102% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, totaled approximately $458 million, up 117% from $210 million last year. We expect to recognize approximately 62% or $285 million of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 68% or $143 million in Q2 of last year. This shift to a larger percentage being in non-current RPO represents longer contract lengths as we succeed with up market customers. Operating cash flow was $31 million in Q2, up from $14 million in the same period a year ago. Free cash flow was $17 million in Q2, up from $8 million in the same period a year-ago. Both of these results are due to our higher profitability, the growth in deferred revenue and strong collections. In addition, we also had a benefit of approximately $7 million to operating cash flow related to employee contributions to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We would expect these contributions to scale with headcount and our first ESPP purchase will be made in Q4. Going forward we expect to see benefits from contributions in Q1 and Q3 and net outflows for purchases in Q2 and Q4. Now turning to guidance. We are pleased to be increasing our outlook for Q3 and the full-year based on our view of the current economic environment, our ability to gain further market share and the momentum we achieved in the first half of FY20. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $155 million to $156 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $6 million to $7 million. This forecast includes the impact of our premier user event, Zoomtopia which will take place in Q3. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.03 based on approximately 294 million shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year '20, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $587 million to $590 million, up from our prior guidance of $535 million to $540 million. We expect to generate positive non-GAAP operating income in all four quarters of the fiscal year. For the full-year non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $42 million to $45 million, up from our prior guidance of breakeven to $3 million. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.18 to $0.19 for the full-year fiscal '20, based on approximately 293 million shares outstanding. This reflects the meaningful profitability seen in Q2, combined with the fact that we remain focused on investing aggressively in the business. We believe we have the opportunity to expand our market share and continue delivering happiness to our customers. We are confident that our long-term business model will drive growth and profitability, which is further evidenced by our Q2 results. In closing, our focus on customers led to rapid top line growth and increased profitability and positive free cash flow for the quarter and for the first half of FY20. I would like to thank the entire Zoom team for their hard work as Q2 was another quarter of strong execution, and positions us well for the full fiscal year. With that, let's open it up for questions. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue-up our first question.\nOperator: Our first question is from Sterling Auty from JPMorgan. Sterling, you are unmuted.\nSterling Auty: All right. Thanks. Hi, guys.\nEric Yuan: Hey, Sterling.\nSterling Auty: I like the background, I think it's better than last quarter. To get us started, can you just comment in terms of what are you experiencing in terms of initial deal sizes? What's the trend that you're seeing over the last couple of quarters?\nKelly Steckelberg: So, we can remain really focused on the strategy of land and expand. So even though we're seeing stronger growth in the upmarket customer base, you saw that grew more quickly than our total customer base. We are still focusing on smaller deal sizes to start and then continue expansion, which you see in the net dollar expansion rate continuously strong at that 130%. So we haven't really seen a dramatic change in our initial deal size.\nSterling Auty: All right. Makes sense. And then one follow-up in terms of Zoom Phone. What kind of attach rates are you seeing in the initial deals on Zoom Phone, or is it still too early, because I think a couple of the examples you gave was really kind of upsell Zoom Phone into existing customers?\nEric Yuan: Yes, Sterling that's a good question. So we launched Zoom Phone service earlier this year. Our kind of strategy is to upsell to other existing installed base. I think it's still too early to tell, but we do see a very good sign. Customers really want to understand what's the differentiation from a Zoom Phone side like a unified collaborating experience. As Kelly shared, one of our larger -- largest customers [indiscernible] deployed Zoom Phone in Q2 realize the ease of use. I think we can replicate that success in the future quarters.\nSterling Auty: That makes sense. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Sterling.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks, Sterling.\nTom McCallum: Next question, please, Matt.\nOperator: Next question is from Matt Statler from William Blair. Matt, you're unmuted.\nMatt Statler: Hey, great quarter and thanks for taking my questions. So first on the Verizon partnership. Obviously, you announced that back in June, with Verizon using Zoom's as a solution for I think small and medium businesses and maybe still reselling WebEx enterprise level. Any feedback just on the initial traction that you're seeing with that partnership and thoughts about establishing similar, similar partnerships with Verizon or others to resell Zoom in the up market as well?\nEric Yuan: Yes, so Verizon partnership, you're right. We set up the Verizon partnership recently. I think we are already gaining momentum. So they are one of the top channel partners and our team really enjoy working together with the Verizon team. We see the great result already. I think -- I think Verizon partnership help us more and this is a great partner.\nMatt Statler: Great. Great. Okay. And then just one more for me on the gross margin front. As you spoke in the prepared remarks, gross margins were strong in the quarter. A little about the high-end of your long-term model. Can you just refresh us on what drove strong performance in the quarter and what you expect to bring that number down a little bit as we look forward? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So the increase in the quarter-over-quarter gross margin was really driven by the increased revenue and the performance on the top line. Going forward, we continue to add more data centers as well as building capacity for all of our customer bases around the globe. And as we continue to invest in this infrastructure, we expect it to continue to be in the range of 80% to 82%.\nMatt Statler: Great. Thank you very much.\nTom McCallum: Thanks, Matt. And Matt, another question please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Heather Bellini from Goldman Sachs. Heather, your line is unmuted.\nHeather Bellini: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question. I just had two. I was wondering Zoom Phone, I know it's a new launch, but I'm wondering how you would benchmark the ARR that you've generated to date versus your expectations at the time you launched it. And also kind of where your wins are, kind of who you're seeing your wins coming from, if you could share with us that. And then also just the other question would be related to the cadence of the expansions you are seeing, given the value that customers start to see pretty quickly from the adoption of your solution. Are you actually starting to see the expansions of those deals starting to happen at a faster pace? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So thanks, Heather. We certainly are. Given that we are selling Zoom Phone into our existing customer base, they already are on the Zoom platform. And so that has accelerated the rollout of Zoom Phone. We\u2019ve seen that in Q1, we talked about Ciena, and they've already continued to roll out to over 5,000 Zoom Phone users around the globe. So that's super exciting. And as you saw the customer that signed in Q2 has already started to roll out their Zoom Phone licenses as well. And interesting to note, they bought more Zoom Phone licenses, than they have with meetings, which we think is a trend will expect to see as well. And then sorry I'm just looking at \u2026\nHeather Bellini: Just benchmarking the ARR. The ARR that you've generated to date from it, how is it doing versus your initial expectations?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, it's doing well. We've seen traction in Zoom Phone across all segments of the business, which we think is really exciting. And approximately 50% of Zoom Phone is coming from customers with AR greater than 100K or more.\nEric Yuan: So to add on to what Kelly said, you look at it today's enterprise market, most of the enterprise customers are still using the on-prem phone system. Over the past several years, SMB customers might have moved to the cloud-based solution. We do see the huge opportunity for the large enterprise segment to go to the cloud based PBX system. They want to have a unified solution. Heather, by the -- yes, Heather by the way, we miss you on video.\nHeather Bellini: Oh, yes, I know. Sorry about that. Next time.\nEric Yuan: No worry. Thank you.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you. Next question please, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brad Zelnick from Credit Suisse. Brad, you're unmuted.\nTom McCallum: Thanks, Brad.\nEric Yuan: Hey, Brad.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Brad.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Hi. Hi, Eric. Hi, Kelly. Hey, Tom. Nice to see everybody. Congratulations on another great quarter. And congrats on adding Ryan as your new Chief Revenue Officer. It's good to hear the long standing relationship that you have with him. What might we expect his priorities might be and what else can he do to help even drive more happiness for Zoom employees and Zoom customers? And I've got a follow-up as well.\nEric Yuan: Yes, that's a good question. By the way, is that a real background or virtual [ph] background? It's so nice. It's better than us. Thank you. So long story short, Ryan and I've been known each other for many, many years, even before Ryan left Cisco to join RingCentral. We already talked about that. Hey, in the future Ryan let's work it together. We talked about that many, many years before, right. It's right time. I think as we further expanded into the large enterprise international and also get into the unified collaboration market, as Ryan's experience can really have us. He's very hands on leader and really understand communication and the collaboration industry. And we have a high confidence with Ryan's joining Zoom, and we can keep the momentum right, not only do we win in the domestic market, but also international market as well.\nBrad Zelnick: That makes a lot of sense. And if I could just ask, the scale of the success and happiness you're delivering to customers, the size of HSBC is nothing short of unbelievable. How should we think about the pricing differential at the very high-end of the market? And perhaps Kelly, if you can, just on a like-for-like basis, give us any kind of color or commentary on what you're seeing pricing wise, perhaps versus a year-ago? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, we haven't seen a dramatic shift in our pricing or in the need from a competitive standpoint from a year-ago. Certainly, as you scale up to a customer size of HSBC, because of the volume and the long-term nature of the contract. We do price that accordingly, as you can imagine. And remember, we also really like the opportunity to do buyouts with our customers, which we often do if they're interested. That's one way that we get them to come in early, and especially if they're with a competitor, but they love Zoom. We want them to have Zoom as quickly as possible.\nBrad Zelnick: Excellent. Thank you so much. Congrats again.\nTom McCallum: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Brad.\nTom McCallum: Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question is from Kash Rangan from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash, you're unmuted.\nKash Rangan: Hi. got to hand it to Brad. I don't know how he managed to smile so beautifully when he was asking his questions. So I'm going to have to try the same thing. How to sound nice, look nice and [technical difficulty] looking at your operating step as a marketing relative with the revenue growth rate, clearly, is this a sign that you have reached that step function, evolution in your business model where the revenue is at a scale where you're starting to see underlying productivity improvements in different line items of the expenses, and you can sustain this level of operating margin. Are there -- were there kind of one-time things that did not appear in your expenses that maybe will reappear in the future, maybe you defer some expenses, or maybe the timing of expenses didn't fall the way you would expect, because although it's terrific to see massive operating leverage in your company, it was also unusual to see sequentially this level of operating margin expansion. So I'm curious as to what drove this? How much of this is permanent versus Chinese expenses? Congratulations on a spectacular quarter. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Kash. Sure. And it's a great question. So just a quick reminder, our philosophy here is that we're investing for growth with discipline and thought. So we are very careful about ensuring that every dollar we spend has an appropriate ROI. With that said, there were a few one-time benefits that we saw in Q2 that led to the higher operating margin. So we had a higher rate of capitalized software that reduced our R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue as compared to the previous quarter. You can see the dollars were about the same, but the percentage came down. We also had a slight benefit in G&A as well as we are now starting to not only collect telco taxes. If you remember, we've talked about telco taxes in the past, we have now started collecting in certain jurisdictions and passing that through, which is reducing our need to accrue for it. And we got to some agreements with some jurisdictions that helped us understand that we could reverse a little bit of our crew that we had in there for things like penalties and interest. So there were a few one-time items that we don't expect to see going forward. And we will really continue to invest in sales and marketing. So we did see -- we\u2019re seeing some efficiencies in marketing, as we discussed in the prepared remarks. But as we see opportunities, we will continue to invest in that area.\nKash Rangan: Congrats. Thank you so much.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Kash.\nEric Yuan: Thank you Kash. By the way, Kash, you are using the phone to join this Zoom video webinar. We can see that you have a little bit of network connectivity issues. Our technology quickly adapt with your network efficiency. We still can hear you well.\nKash Rangan: Great. Awesome.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Kash.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Next question, please, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Zukin, from RBC. Alex, you're unmuted now.\nTom McCallum: Hey, Alex.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys.\nEric Yuan: Congratulations.\nAlex Zukin: Thank you. Thank you. You guys congratulations on another great quarter as well. I've got two quick ones. One, maybe first, Eric, on the federal government and the federal vertical. You guys have achieved FedRAMP certification. I'm just curious how you see that playing out for you from a pipeline perspective, from a deal perspective? How important is that vertical to your growth prospects? And then I've got a quick just a financial question for Kelly.\nEric Yuan: Yes, so to have a FedRAMP certificate is very important for us to expand into the public sector. Prior to that we even don't have a team, right, because we do not have that certificate. Given that we have that now, I think it's too early to tell because we just established a public sector team for targeting public sectors. We do have a many state level customers. I think in the next several quarters probably would see some contribution from public sectors.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. And then, Kelly, if I do the rough math on kind of current RPO bookings, I get to around 81%, 82%. I'm curious, is that the right kind of forward-looking indicator given some of the different methods you guys have, from a sales and contracting perspective? Is that an important metric for you guys? Or is billings the better one right now?\nKelly Steckelberg: So billings is really not a good metric for us due to the split of our customers that pay monthly versus annually. Remember, the core base of the company, while it is shifting, is still really based on SMB customers that pay monthly on a credit card. So buildings is really not a good metric for an indicator. I would certainly say that RPO is a much better metric to use.\nAlex Zukin: Great. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Alex. Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Phil Winslow from Wells Fargo. Phil, you're unmuted.\nTom McCallum: See the Wells Fargo.\nKelly Steckelberg: I know I love your marketing Phil.\nPhil Winslow: Thank you. You like that?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nPhil Winslow: [Indiscernible] a bit. But my questions actually are just going to be on just what you're saying in terms of the customer in terms of replacement versus net new expansion. In other words, what percentage you\u2019re seeing are replacing a existing solution versus actually with the customer either coming to you net new or actually expanding the number of seats versus prior provider? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, if you talk about when we're going into our new base of customers, and when we're going into the up market, there's certainly always an incumbent that we are replacing there. And it's all the traditional providers that you would know. In SMB, it often can either be Greenfield, or maybe three that we are competing with, or some of the more mass market vendors that you're also very familiar with. As I said earlier, your net retention expansion rate though, remains really strong at a 130%, as we continue to start with small seated land and expand and then growing up from there.\nPhil Winslow: Great. And then just a follow-up in terms of that land and expand. So at Eric's point about Zoom being super easy to use, and so it's a more user guy actually using what do you think in terms of sort of that seat expansion, particularly when it was replacing an existing [indiscernible]?\nKelly Steckelberg: Well, in terms of seat expansion, you're saying in general, or across specific customers?\nPhil Winslow: Just on the larger customers.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, I mean, I think it -- customers are buying in two different ways. Obviously, we saw with HSBC, one of the largest customer deal is the largest customer single deal we've ever had. And yet now our second, our previously largest customer had another add-on in this quarter, which was over $1 million in ARR. So even in our large customers, we continue to see expansion as they add on new products like Zoom Phone, and I think very few of our customers today are wall to wall with Zoom meetings. And so, as they continue to build trust with Zoom and with the platform, then see the value they continue to expand that globally throughout their teams.\nTom McCallum: Great.\nPhil Winslow: Great. Thanks a lot.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nTom McCallum: Thanks, Phil. Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question is from Pat Walravens from JMP. Pat, you are unmuted.\nEric Yuan: Hi Pat.\nPat Walravens: Great. Hi, guys.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Pat.\nPat Walravens: Thank you. I like the 5:30 start time by the way. It makes the [multiple speakers]\nKelly Steckelberg: It's better for you guys?\nTom McCallum: Yes.\nPat Walravens: Yes, yes. Especially on a busy day like today.\nTom McCallum: That\u2019s why [indiscernible] get it.\nPat Walravens: So I think this is for both Kelly and Eric. Look what's going to be the biggest challenge in continuing to scale at this rate and I realize your guidance is not at this rate, but to continue to scale like we are here, what's going to be the biggest challenge?\nEric Yuan: I think for sure for us to further scale our business many challenges. I would say the most important challenge is to maintain our company culture. We already have almost 2,300 employees. As we further expand into the international market, doubled our sales and R&D team, we are going to hire more and more people, top [indiscernible]. However, how to maintain our delivering happiness culture, make sure all of us always look at everything from customer perspective, right, responding to customer issues in a timely manner. That's a challenge. How to turn the new employees and make sure we are very humble, paranoid to care about the customer, that's a number one challenge. Other challenges are very manageable, like a product, may be the sales efficiency, the cost is not a big challenge.\nPat Walravens: All right. And then I'm going to ask one more if I can, which is I was driving up the 101 today, I saw a billboard which said, Zoom and Slack, see what together can do? So Eric, what can together they do?\nEric Yuan: I have a similar question to you, maybe you can tell us what they can do? But anyway, so I'm a huge fan of Slack, right, and a huge fan of [indiscernible]. I think many of our customers, they told us, they like best-of-breed service. They follow both Zoom and Slack, they kind of hire talents all over the world like a [indiscernible] envision. They standardize on Zoom and Slack platform, guess what, if they don't have a single physical office, right, I think the best-of-breed service can truly deliver happiness to our customers. That's why we like this partnership. We want to do more with Slack. Together we wanted to make sure costumer happy.\nPat Walravens: All right. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Great.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks, Pat.\nTom McCallum: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Next question, please, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Kurtz from KeyBanc. Alex, you are unmuted.\nEric Yuan: Hey, Alex.\nAlex Kurtz: Yes, thanks. Thanks, everyone. Great quarter. I love the video interaction here. It's awesome. So just on the net expansion rate in the quarter, how much is that being driven by new seats versus the phone? Then I had a clarifier on margin.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, it's being driven primarily by new seats as well, you were excited about the momentum we're seeing in phone, it's still a very, very small contributor to revenue. We just reminded, we launched it only in January. It did go GA in both Australia and the U.K in Q2, but it's really having a very small impact at this point.\nAlex Kurtz: And just on your margin assumptions in the back half of the year around the adoption of phone, is there anything that we should be thinking about as far as the variables around that, any impact there?\nKelly Steckelberg: No. The only impact for -- on margins in the second half of the year are around expanding data centers, we are planning to add two to three more, but that is not necessarily having to do with Zoom Phone. It's just adding capacity in general for our users around the globe.\nAlex Kurtz: Okay, right. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yes, by the way from architecture perspective, our video conferencing and Zoom Phone, we shared the same platform. As Kelly mentioned, we just needed to expand our capacity. That's pretty much, yes.\nAlex Kurtz: Okay. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you. Thanks, Alex. And, Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Meta Marshall from Morgan Stanley. Meta, you are unmuted.\nTom McCallum: Hi, Meta.\nEric Yuan: Hi, Meta.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Meta.\nMeta Marshall: Hey, congrats on the quarter. So I just wanted to ask a couple of questions, maybe first and get your response to that. As you approach customers with Zoom Phone, has it changed your perspective on kind of cadence of additional features you will need to add over time, or has it really kind of met expectations to date and the cadence you were planning?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So, today our strategy is focus on upsell, right? We already build our trust. Customers really like our video conferencing experience, in terms of video quality and voice quality. We truly believe video is the new voice. Essentially, the way for customer the uses of phone is more like another way to use our video conferencing service, right? Customer -- even if they deploy a solution on the web, they feel like very familiar with our service. Just the same experience, same unified client, I think is, customer really like that experience. We do not need to tell customers to train customers. They feel like there's a part of the overall collaboration platform. This is a very natural experience.\nMeta Marshall: Got it. And then maybe on kind of the hiring of Ryan. Traditionally you guys have not had a large channel presence. And so, he, obviously, has a lot of experience there. Does it change your perspective on how you think of the channel as a method of go-to-market, or just how does the hiring of Ryan kind of change the go-to-market approach?\nEric Yuan: Yes, well, that's a good question. In terms of channel strategy, we just announced the Verizon partnership and the channel always plays a big role for our revenue growth. And even if you look at the total revenue, probably driven by the revenue team, as we further expand into the international market, with Ryan's good background, I would say, the channel contribution will play a big role in the future. Like Verizon partnership just started and we are going to more and more channel partners to help us expand into the international market.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Congrats, guys.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks, Meta.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Roderick from Stifel. Tom, you are unmuted.\nKelly Steckelberg: Matt, can you unmute it?\nTom McCallum: Hey, Tom. There he is, I see him. Hey, Tom.\nTom Roderick: Congratulations on another fantastic quarter. Well done. Eric, I want to ask my first question to you and I want to put a finer point on the question. Pat just asked about, maintaining culture. Getting to a scale, that's pretty remarkable here. And I think you're up to about 2,200 employees. Can you talk a little bit about what you're doing to drive that hiring plan in place? How you are building out HR? Capturing that incremental employee at a great company like Zoom is always good problem to have, but you're getting to a scale and makes it challenging. Can you talk a little bit about just hiring and the challenge of that at scale?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So, well, in terms of hiring, so on the one hand, we wanted to do hire as quickly as possible, right? Because we have great opportunities. On the other hand, we also want to be very careful, right? We want to make sure we hire the right employees who can fit very well to our company culture with self-motivation, self-learning personality. And hiring side of that, I think we have a very aggressive hiring goal. But, to be honest with you, every quarter we did miss that, right? So the reason why we want to focus on the company culture, and we -- this is not a -- this is not a one person company, our management team company, all part of Zoom. We refer employees to join us. We do all the kind of hire for the new employees to make sure they are familiar with our business process or product. We have each other, care for each other. I think to do that right, we don't want to be too aggressive, right? That's the challenge, because sometimes I say, yes, let's hire another [indiscernible] people and starting to realize that it might break our company culture. That's why we have to balance everything, so.\nKelly Steckelberg: Tom, earlier this year we hired Lynne as our Chief People Officer, and just last week we hired a new Head of Talent Acquisition as well. And I think both of them are really focused on doing exactly what Eric said, which is hiring the right people, hiring quickly, but not lowering the bar. So, it's been a great -- two great additions to the team, yes.\nTom Roderick: Excellent. And then, Kelly, just one follow-up for you on the RPO commentary, following that the current RPO number, that is declining, as you see more and more customers at the enterprise level signing up for multi-year deal. Should we expect that trend to continue? Where the current number will -- the percentage will shrink just as a function of more enterprise multi-year deals out there?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, I think certainly we are continuing to see more and more of our revenue base come from up market customers is that's really one of our key strategic focus areas. How quickly that grows? I don't know. But absolutely, it's one of the key focuses that we\u2019ve for growing the company this year.\nTom Roderick: Got it. Understood. Thank you, guys.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Great. Thank you, Tom. Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ittai Kidron from Oppenheimer. Ittai, you're unmuted. We will give Ittai another moment. Next question is going to be from Zane Chrane from Bernstein. Zane, [technical difficulty].\nZane Chrane: Thank you very much.\nEric Yuan: Hey, Zane.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Zane.\nZane Chrane: Congratulations on a great quarter.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nZane Chrane: [Indiscernible] solid results. So I was just wondering if you could dig into the architecture and the technology a little bit, Eric. One of the push backs I hear from skeptics is that, a good program replicates something like Zoom or video conferencing over the weekend and it's not really differentiated solution. That's not what I've heard from enterprise customers that have adopted Zoom. So I was just wondering, if you could dig into what is the secret sauce that really makes your technology and architecture unique and difficult to replicate? Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Well, so in terms of large enterprise customers, for sure, when we started, we were focusing on SMB customers, right. Over the past several years, we started expanding into large enterprise customers. And the reason why we do see the -- we -- almost every enterprise customers, we do see a lot of users. Even for the large enterprise customers or the standardize on other platform, we see the one user, two user, one department, and two department, they all use their own budget to deploy Zoom. The reason why they are not happy about any other services in terms of ease-of-use, the quality, like this what\u2019s your background or feature and consistent experience across the desktop, mobile and conference room statistics, right. I think the combination of technology, ease-of-use, security will win the customer trust, right. If you look at all other solutions out there today, all of them architecture is very old, right? Not a design for modern video cloud -- video first architecture. That's why we're ahead of any of our competitors for several years. Otherwise, I will go back to work all the weekend.\nZane Chrane: Yes, that's really interesting. One of the things I think is really fascinating is the extensibility and the APIs to connecting another platforms. It seems like there's a lot of Greenfield opportunity there for maybe tying in with vendors like Salesforce or HubSpot or other cloud providers. Could you talk about what your vision is for those partnerships and kind of the technology integration to build that ecosystem?\nEric Yuan: That's a good question. Today, look, you talk with many customers in -- on one hand, they all like best-of-breed services. On the other hand, quite often you need to switch back and forth in terms of context, say like, a Dropbox or Box to Zoom or Salesforce to Zoom, the last into Zoom, right. A customer like to stay within the same context, right, say, like I'm using the Jira Atlassian system, right. Within that Jira system I can launch a Zoom call, join a Zoom meeting [indiscernible] meeting, I think that what the customer told us. That's why how to seamlessly embed Zoom into any other business workflow applications, that's the direction to go. That's the reason why we're announcing the Zoom marketplace, right? Give a customer a very flexible API. Customer even -- they do not know that it belong to a Zoom call. They feel like they are going to stay within the work day, the user interface or ServiceNow user interface. I think that's the direction.\nZane Chrane: Sounds great. Well, thanks a lot and congratulations on a great quarter.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Zane.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks, Zane.\nTom McCallum: Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Koontz from Rosenblatt. Ryan, you are unmuted.\nRyan Koontz: Great. Thanks, guys. Congrats on a great quarter. Given your early success in the enterprise space, why don't you give us some color on the market verticals you're seeing the lowest hanging fruit for competitive displacements out there?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So, when we started, we were focusing on high-tech market and later on we expanded into the high-end, as well as healthcare market. Over the past two to three years, we also doubled on financial sectors, and we\u2019re going to focus on public sector as well. Over the past two quarters, we do see a very good momentum in our financial sectors. I think we are going to see more and more big enterprise customers from financial sector.\nRyan Koontz: Helpful. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Great.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thanks, Ryan.\nTom McCallum: Thank you. Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Next question is from Jonathan Kees from Summit Insights Group. Jonathan, you are unmuted.\nJonathan Kees: Great. I want to add my congratulations for the quarter. Great results. I want to ask a couple of topics. One, in regards to -- how I'm thinking about it, this is -- you beat your guidance, you beat estimates. When you gave guidance for this quarter you just reported, is about a month and a few days after the quarter ended. So, I guess, the way I'm thinking about is a lot of the revenue, a lot of the deals were more back-end loaded. Was there anything specific that caused that? Did you have any promotions or were there deals, like an HSBC deal that were in the previous quarter that came over into this report quarter? Just curious in terms of how that upside trended in terms of revenues and also, yes, what caused that?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Hi, Jonathan. We did not see a tremendous shift in our linearity for the quarter. As we move into more and more enterprise customers, some of them do buy towards the back part of the quarter. But due to the -- we have customers of all sizes, so they tend to buy consistently -- pretty consistently throughout the period. So, I think, part of the over performance against our guidance was, again, us giving guidance that we want to ensure that we can achieve as a public company.\nJonathan Kees: Okay, great. That makes sense. And second topic, if I can here, this one is more for you, Eric. I understand that you make it a task to reach out to customers who've left and try to understand why they're left or are leaving. I think that personal touch is wonderful. Just curious if you share with us any gems, anything that you've learned in terms of why these customers have left or thinking about leaving?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So, several years ago, I did spend a lot of time talking with those customers who left, but over the past two to three years, I did not spend too much time on that, because a lot of those users will cancel their service are very low and went per users. Actually, they really do not leave the Zoom. It's like they are going to take the family vacation over the summer timeframe and they cancel the service. After the summer, they're going to risk it as well, right. So we did not see any very big large enterprise customers, that's why I spend less and less time on that. So -- and yes, so really do not focus on that anymore.\nTom McCallum: Hey, Jonathan, did you get the camera we sent you?\nQ - Jonathan Kees: Yes. Wonderful. I hope -- can you see me? Is the camera off?\nTom McCallum: No, we can't.\nJonathan Kees: Oh, no.\nTom McCallum: We will help you out in the next one. I will follow up and we will make sure it gets you on there, so \u2026\nJonathan Kees: Oh, no. I'm using it right now. I guess, you can hear the mic?\nTom McCallum: Yes.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nJonathan Kees: Okay. Yes, I am using it right now. So sorry about that. I thought it was on camera.\nTom McCallum: No worries. I just want to make sure you got it. Thank you. Hey, Matt, how many more do we have?\nOperator: We have one more question. Next question and last question is from Ryan Williams from Stephens. Ryan, you are unmuted now.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Hi, Ryan.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Ryan.\nRyan MacWilliams: So, in a recent interview, Eric, you mentioned that 95% of your engineers are working on voice video. But you noted your focus is always on what customers are asking for. Are there any current capabilities customers are asking for aside from Zoom meeting phone?\nEric Yuan: I think, first of all, we already have a roadmap, right. At the same time, we wanted to talk with the customers and make sure our roadmap fits well to customer need. Having said that, we\u2019ve so many large enterprise customers, quite often if they tell us a feature or a solution, it's really hard for us to prioritize that. That's why every time we offer product managers, our sales engineers always try to understand what's the pain point from a customer side, quite often they have a same pain point. And because of that, I think you look at our feature set roadmap is not that very complex, right. It's kind of we understand the pain point and want to make sure our solution can fit very well to customer need. Having said that, I think we do not have the challenges to manage the feature request from a large enterprise customers. The roadmap is -- we always share the roadmap with our large enterprise customers, they all buy that.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks. And one last question on acquisitions. Last quarter, you mentioned that you're keeping your options open. But to this point, do you currently believe you\u2019ve the infrastructure in place to handle a large acquisition?\nEric Yuan: I think, well, in terms of acquisition, I think, we are working very hard on day-to-day execution and huge opportunity ahead of us. And we do not see any great opportunity, right. If you know of any opportunity, please let us know. Otherwise, we are just laser focused on our execution to make sure our customer happy.\nTom McCallum: 20 investment bankers are now calling you, Eric.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nEric Yuan: I do not have money. Money from Kelly's side.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks, guys.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Congratulations on new position too. So Eric, do you have any closing remarks?\nEric Yuan: So, I think, Ittai also in the call, right?\nTom McCallum: Oh, yes. Matt, does Ittai still with us?\nOperator: Let's see if we can get him back. We tried him earlier. So Ittai, you are unmuted again.\nEric Yuan: Ittai, are you on the call?\nKelly Steckelberg: Who is joining in his place?\nOperator: He did have somebody joined earlier and we did confirmed with him earlier they were on the phone. I'm not sure if they're listening at the moment.\nEric Yuan: Okay.\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\nTom McCallum: Thank you Matt.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Thank you all for joining us and we look forward to seeing many of you at Zoomtopia. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Bye, everybody.",

            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and welcome to everyone joining us today. Let me start by first reviewing financial results for Q2. And then I will discuss our outlook for Q3 and the full fiscal year. Total revenue grew 96% year-over-year in the second quarter, to $146 million. This top line result exceeded the high-end of our guidance range and had a positive impact on our profitability and free cash flow. Similar to last quarter, we executed very well in a strong demand environment for the Zoom platform. This execution was represented broadly across our major geographies and offerings. Key drivers of our revenue performance included both our acquisition of new customers and expansion of Zoom's footprint within existing customers. Specifically, new customers accounted for approximately 61% of our year-over-year growth in subscription revenue while the remaining 39% was due to additional purchases from existing customers. Here are some key customer metrics from Q2. We exited the quarter with over 66,300 customers with more than 10 employees, up 78% year-over-year. This is a record number of new customer additions in a quarter. One of our key verticals is the Financial Services sector. I am pleased to share with you that we are experiencing strong success in this segment with firms like HSBC, Moody's and Morgan Stanley becoming Zoom customers in Q2. The combination of our land and expand strategy, along with our continued up-market focus, resulted in Q2 ending with 466 customers with more than $100,000 in revenue over the last 12 months, this is up 104% year-over-year. This also led to a net dollar expansion rate that was over 130% for the 5th consecutive quarter as customers are deploying more Zoom products and adding more licenses within their organization. One example was a significant expansion with a large luxury brand. This customer began their relationship with Zoom last year and quickly deployed Zoom meetings to approximately 3,800 users to replace their legacy video conferencing provider. Because of their trust in Zoom, they then invited us to provide a modern solution for the phone service in their corporate offices and stores. After a comprehensive evaluation, they selected Zoom Phone in Q2. They cited call quality, ease of use, cost savings, and the unified Zoom platform of meetings, chat and phone as important benefits to their organization. They have already begun the rollout of 4,700 Zoom Phone licenses within their organization. The customer also plans to roll out Zoom Phone to their 750 domestic retail stores starting in early 2020 and rest of the world soon thereafter. This is an exciting win for us and it demonstrates the potential to upsell technologies when you make existing customers happy and build trust. Geographic expansion is another driver of our revenue growth as we continue to deliver strong growth internationally. In Q2, our APAC and EMEA revenue combined grew a 115% year-over-year and represented approximately 20% of revenue. Revenue from the Americas was up 91% year-over-year and represented approximately 80% of revenue. This high revenue growth and strategic customer wins are evidence that our investments to expand our global footprint are succeeding. Now turning to profitability. Here you can see we were profitable from both a GAAP and non-GAAP perspective, but I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense, and related share-based equity taxes. Non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 82.2%, compared to 82.8% in Q2 of year and 80.9% last quarter. For the full-year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of our long-term target of 80% to 82% as we continue to scale our infrastructure to support our growth. R&D expense in Q2 was approximately $13 million, up 83% on a year-over-year basis. We expect to continue to invest in innovating our platform and see R&D returning to the range of 10% to 12% of revenue which is consistent with our long-term view. Sales and marketing expense for Q2 was $69 million. This reflects an increase of 70% or $28 million over last year with investments in initiatives to drive further growth. As a percent of total revenue, Sales and Marketing was 47%, lower than Q2 last year as we have seen some efficiency gains in marketing. Looking forward, we expect to continue to invest in this area especially to drive international and up market growth. G&A expense in Q2 was $18 million and represented 12% of total revenue. This result represents our continued investment to support our status as a publicly traded company. Non-GAAP operating income was $21 million translating to a 14.2% non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter. This was an improvement of 812 basis points as compared to Q2 of last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q2 was $0.08, on approximately 292 million of non-GAAP, weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.06 higher than the high end of our guidance and $0.06 higher than Q2 of last year due to the outperformance in the quarter. Now turning to the balance sheet. We ended Q2 with approximately $755 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $181 million, up 102% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our remaining performance obligations, or RPO, totaled approximately $458 million, up 117% from $210 million last year. We expect to recognize approximately 62% or $285 million of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 68% or $143 million in Q2 of last year. This shift to a larger percentage being in non-current RPO represents longer contract lengths as we succeed with up market customers. Operating cash flow was $31 million in Q2, up from $14 million in the same period a year ago. Free cash flow was $17 million in Q2, up from $8 million in the same period a year-ago. Both of these results are due to our higher profitability, the growth in deferred revenue and strong collections. In addition, we also had a benefit of approximately $7 million to operating cash flow related to employee contributions to our Employee Stock Purchase Plan. We would expect these contributions to scale with headcount and our first ESPP purchase will be made in Q4. Going forward we expect to see benefits from contributions in Q1 and Q3 and net outflows for purchases in Q2 and Q4. Now turning to guidance. We are pleased to be increasing our outlook for Q3 and the full-year based on our view of the current economic environment, our ability to gain further market share and the momentum we achieved in the first half of FY20. For the third quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $155 million to $156 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $6 million to $7 million. This forecast includes the impact of our premier user event, Zoomtopia which will take place in Q3. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.03 based on approximately 294 million shares outstanding. For the full fiscal year '20, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $587 million to $590 million, up from our prior guidance of $535 million to $540 million. We expect to generate positive non-GAAP operating income in all four quarters of the fiscal year. For the full-year non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $42 million to $45 million, up from our prior guidance of breakeven to $3 million. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.18 to $0.19 for the full-year fiscal '20, based on approximately 293 million shares outstanding. This reflects the meaningful profitability seen in Q2, combined with the fact that we remain focused on investing aggressively in the business. We believe we have the opportunity to expand our market share and continue delivering happiness to our customers. We are confident that our long-term business model will drive growth and profitability, which is further evidenced by our Q2 results. In closing, our focus on customers led to rapid top line growth and increased profitability and positive free cash flow for the quarter and for the first half of FY20. I would like to thank the entire Zoom team for their hard work as Q2 was another quarter of strong execution, and positions us well for the full fiscal year. With that, let's open it up for questions. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue-up our first question. So, we can remain really focused on the strategy of land and expand. So even though we're seeing stronger growth in the upmarket customer base, you saw that grew more quickly than our total customer base. We are still focusing on smaller deal sizes to start and then continue expansion, which you see in the net dollar expansion rate continuously strong at that 130%. So we haven't really seen a dramatic change in our initial deal size. Thanks, Sterling. Yes. So the increase in the quarter-over-quarter gross margin was really driven by the increased revenue and the performance on the top line. Going forward, we continue to add more data centers as well as building capacity for all of our customer bases around the globe. And as we continue to invest in this infrastructure, we expect it to continue to be in the range of 80% to 82%. Yes. So thanks, Heather. We certainly are. Given that we are selling Zoom Phone into our existing customer base, they already are on the Zoom platform. And so that has accelerated the rollout of Zoom Phone. We've seen that in Q1, we talked about Ciena, and they've already continued to roll out to over 5,000 Zoom Phone users around the globe. So that's super exciting. And as you saw the customer that signed in Q2 has already started to roll out their Zoom Phone licenses as well. And interesting to note, they bought more Zoom Phone licenses, than they have with meetings, which we think is a trend will expect to see as well. And then sorry I'm just looking at ... Yes, it's doing well. We've seen traction in Zoom Phone across all segments of the business, which we think is really exciting. And approximately 50% of Zoom Phone is coming from customers with AR greater than 100K or more. Hi, Brad. Yes, we haven't seen a dramatic shift in our pricing or in the need from a competitive standpoint from a year-ago. Certainly, as you scale up to a customer size of HSBC, because of the volume and the long-term nature of the contract. We do price that accordingly, as you can imagine. And remember, we also really like the opportunity to do buyouts with our customers, which we often do if they're interested. That's one way that we get them to come in early, and especially if they're with a competitor, but they love Zoom. We want them to have Zoom as quickly as possible. Thank you, Kash. Sure. And it's a great question. So just a quick reminder, our philosophy here is that we're investing for growth with discipline and thought. So we are very careful about ensuring that every dollar we spend has an appropriate ROI. With that said, there were a few one-time benefits that we saw in Q2 that led to the higher operating margin. So we had a higher rate of capitalized software that reduced our R&D expenses as a percentage of revenue as compared to the previous quarter. You can see the dollars were about the same, but the percentage came down. We also had a slight benefit in G&A as well as we are now starting to not only collect telco taxes. If you remember, we've talked about telco taxes in the past, we have now started collecting in certain jurisdictions and passing that through, which is reducing our need to accrue for it. And we got to some agreements with some jurisdictions that helped us understand that we could reverse a little bit of our crew that we had in there for things like penalties and interest. So there were a few one-time items that we don't expect to see going forward. And we will really continue to invest in sales and marketing. So we did see -- we're seeing some efficiencies in marketing, as we discussed in the prepared remarks. But as we see opportunities, we will continue to invest in that area. Thank you, Kash. Thank you, Kash. So billings is really not a good metric for us due to the split of our customers that pay monthly versus annually. Remember, the core base of the company, while it is shifting, is still really based on SMB customers that pay monthly on a credit card. So buildings is really not a good metric for an indicator. I would certainly say that RPO is a much better metric to use. I know I love your marketing Phil. Yes. Yes. So, if you talk about when we're going into our new base of customers, and when we're going into the up market, there's certainly always an incumbent that we are replacing there. And it's all the traditional providers that you would know. In SMB, it often can either be Greenfield, or maybe three that we are competing with, or some of the more mass market vendors that you're also very familiar with. As I said earlier, your net retention expansion rate though, remains really strong at a 130%, as we continue to start with small seated land and expand and then growing up from there. Well, in terms of seat expansion, you're saying in general, or across specific customers? Yes, I mean, I think it -- customers are buying in two different ways. Obviously, we saw with HSBC, one of the largest customer deal is the largest customer single deal we've ever had. And yet now our second, our previously largest customer had another add-on in this quarter, which was over $1 million in ARR. So even in our large customers, we continue to see expansion as they add on new products like Zoom Phone, and I think very few of our customers today are wall to wall with Zoom meetings. And so, as they continue to build trust with Zoom and with the platform, then see the value they continue to expand that globally throughout their teams. Yes. Hi, Pat. It's better for you guys? Thanks, Pat. Yes, it's being driven primarily by new seats as well, you were excited about the momentum we're seeing in phone, it's still a very, very small contributor to revenue. We just reminded, we launched it only in January. It did go GA in both Australia and the U.K in Q2, but it's really having a very small impact at this point. No. The only impact for -- on margins in the second half of the year are around expanding data centers, we are planning to add two to three more, but that is not necessarily having to do with Zoom Phone. It's just adding capacity in general for our users around the globe. Hi, Meta. Thanks, Meta. Matt, can you unmute it? Tom, earlier this year we hired Lynne as our Chief People Officer, and just last week we hired a new Head of Talent Acquisition as well. And I think both of them are really focused on doing exactly what Eric said, which is hiring the right people, hiring quickly, but not lowering the bar. So, it's been a great -- two great additions to the team, yes. Yes, I think certainly we are continuing to see more and more of our revenue base come from up market customers is that's really one of our key strategic focus areas. How quickly that grows? I don't know. But absolutely, it's one of the key focuses that we've for growing the company this year. Yes. Hi, Zane. Thank you. Thanks, Zane. Yes. Hi, Jonathan. We did not see a tremendous shift in our linearity for the quarter. As we move into more and more enterprise customers, some of them do buy towards the back part of the quarter. But due to the -- we have customers of all sizes, so they tend to buy consistently -- pretty consistently throughout the period. So, I think, part of the over performance against our guidance was, again, us giving guidance that we want to ensure that we can achieve as a public company. Yes. Hi, Ryan. Yes. Thank you. Who is joining in his place? Okay. Thanks, Matt. Bye, everybody."

At this time, I'd like to turn the floor over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Matt. Hello, everyone and welcome to Zoom's earnings webinar for the first quarter fiscal 2020. Joining me today will be Zoom's President and CEO, Eric Yuan, and Zoom CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and maybe downloaded from the zoom.com site on the Investor Relations page. Also on this page you will be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and slide deck of financial highlights that along with the earnings press release include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results.  During this call we will make forward-looking statements about our future financial performance and other future events or trends, including guidance. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that could affect our financial results and the performance of our business and which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today\u2019s earnings press release and the risk factors and other information contained in the final prospectus relating to our initial public offering. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today\u2019s call. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Tom. Thank you all. So, first of all, welcome to all of you joining us on today\u2019s Zoom video webinar. I really appreciate. And hopefully after the webinar all of you can give us some feedback and of course we really want to leverage our platform for the future earnings call. Like a brag, I like you all what you brag on. Please tell about what you brag on. So this is our first earnings announcement as a public company and I am pleased to report that we delivered revenue of $122 million for the first quarter, an increase of 103% year-over-year.  In addition to tremendous growth at scale, we are also pleased that our highly efficient business model and disciplined investments contributed to positive profitability and free cash flow. Our strong first quarter results are evidence that organizations are turning to Zoom as a strategic technology partner to help them increase communications and collaboration.  Since this is our first earnings call as a public company, I would like to take a step back to share how Zoom\u2019s video first approach delivers happiness to our customers. First, we deliver a single, easy to use platform. Second, we are 100% Cloud-Native and hardware agnostic. Third, we offer high quality service globally. Fourth, we offer robust mobile functionality. Fifth, we are developer friendly with open APIs also with the market place. We believe the growth opportunity for Zoom is significant. Based on IDC estimates the markets opportunity at TAM is huge, $43 billion dollar market by 2022. But we believe that it is even larger than that as we are in the early stages of video becoming the new voice.  Our platform is fundamentally transforming the way organizations of all sizes communicate. Zoom is enabling far greater effectiveness and intimacy in human-to-human interactions over a distance, and we are witnessing the rapid adoption of Zoom for diverse use cases that were not possible with legacy technology. So let me give you an example of how our customers leverage Zoom platform. One company Ciena, networking systems, services and Software Company has been a Zoom customer, happy customer for the last two years. They have built up to a full site deployment of Zoom including Zoom Rooms, Zoom Webinar and our premium audio.  They have transformed how they conduct business and communicate with a video first culture. They are currently doing more than 10 million minutes a month on Zoom platform. When faced with replacing their legacy very complex PBX infrastructure, they turned to Zoom and Ciena was very impressed with capabilities of Zoom Phone system. So we closed a deal with Ciena in Q1 that brings their Zoom Phone licenses to 5,000 users, while significantly expanding the use of the Zoom platform within their organization. This is a great example of the trust customers have in Zoom.  Now let me discuss a few recent business and technology highlights that further reinforce our long-term growth opportunity. First, we announced that our FedRAMP authorization has been approved, with the sponsorship of the US Department of Homeland Security. This authorization allows US Federal Government agencies and contractors to securely use Zoom for video meetings, API integrations, and more.  Second, we continued to build out our best of breed partnerships with deeper relationships like HP, Salesforce.com and Slack. Many companies, they standardize on Zoom and Slack platform, that sort of like standard for collaboration. Third, we continued to enhance our core technologies that have disrupted the video communications market. During the Enterprise Connect in March, we announced additional Smart features to Zoom meetings such as real-time transcriptions. And fourth, we continue to enhance and extend the reach of Zoom Phone. We announced new features that enable Zoom Phone to elevate voice calls to Zoom Video meetings seamlessly, a bring your own carrier service and a new beta for Zoom Phone service for both the UK and Australia. In summary, I\u2019d like to thank our nearly 2,000 Zoom employees around the globe for an exceptional performance in our first quarter as a public company. Our industry leading, video-first architecture, viral adoption model, and large TAM, were also positive factors to our remarkable results this quarter. It was a great start for the year, and we are excited about the growth opportunities in front of us. We truly believe zoom is well positioned to capitalize on the transformation of how companies communicate and collaborate with their employees, partners and customers.  In many ways we are helping to drive this transformation. The strategy that we have employed over the years to make our customers happy with a frictionless communications platform is working, and it continues to deliver remarkable results.  With that, let me turn things over to Kelly. \nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric. And welcome to everyone joining us. Let me start by first reviewing financial results for Q1 and then I will discuss our outlook for Q2 and the full fiscal year. As Eric discussed, total revenue grew 103% year-over-year in the first quarter, to $122 million. Some of the key drivers of our revenue performance were our acquisition of new customers and the execution of our land and expand strategy with existing customers. Specifically, the year-over-year increase in revenue was split between subscription services provided to new customers which accounted for approximately64% of the increase while the remaining 36% increase was due to subscription services for existing customers. Here are some key customer metrics in Q1 that drove these results. We had over 58,500 customers with more than 10 employees, up nearly 86% year-over-year. We aren't just adding a large volume of new customers though. We are also winning larger customers as a result of our enterprise focus. For example, we are excited to announce, we added new customers including DocuSign and FICO. And customers of all size are deploying more Zoom products and users within their organizations as they realize the power of our platform. During the first quarter, we expanded our relationship with customers including Ciena and Take-Two Interactive. The combination of our land and expand strategy, along with our growing enterprise focus, resulted in 405 customers with more than $100,000 in revenue over the last 12 months, up 120% year-over-year. Overall, we have a loyal customer base, as evidenced by an exceptional net dollar expansion rate that has consistently been over 130% for the fourth consecutive quarter. Geographic expansion is another driver of our strong revenue growth as we continue to enjoy high demand and growth globally. Revenue in Q1 from the Americas was up 98% year-over-year and was approximately 80% of revenue.  Our APAC and EMEA revenue combined grew 127% year-over-year. We believe that this is only the beginning of a tremendous opportunity to bring the Zoom platform to customers around the world. To achieve this, we will make additional investments to expand our global footprint and drive additional growth. Now turning to profitability. Here you can see we were profitable from both a GAAP and non-GAAP perspective, but I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter was up 17 basis points to 80.9%, compared to 80.7% in Q1 last year. Our non-GAAP gross margin reflects some additional investments to increase the redundancy of our infrastructure. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP gross margins to be at the low-end of our long-term target range of 80% to 82%. R&D expense in Q1 was $13 million and represented approximately 10% of total revenue. R&D remains a major investment area as we expand our platform with new features and capabilities every quarter. Approximately one-third of our workforce is R&D, however, it is lower as a percentage of revenue because we have a highly efficient global R&D model.  Sales and marketing expense for Q1 was $61 million, representing approximately 50% of total revenue. While we expect to realize leverage in sales and marketing over the long-term, we are currently focused on adding sales capacity to drive growth and capture the large TAM in front of us. These investments include ramping key strategic initiatives such as expanding our global footprint and building out our initial sales coverage for Zoom Phone.  G&A expense in Q1 was $16 million and represented 13% of total revenue. This includes costs associated with expanding our corporate functions to effectively operate as a public company. Non-GAAP operating income was $8 million translating to a 6.7% non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter. This was 8 percentage points improvement versus the modest non-GAAP operating loss in Q1 last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q1 were $0.03, on approximately 290 million of non-GAAP, weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. Non-GAAP EPS increased three cents from Q1 of last year.  Turning to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with approximately $737 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities which is up from $176 million at the end of Q4. The significant increase in cash was due primarily to$543 million of net proceeds from our IPO and our growth in cash flow from operations. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter grew to $149 million, up 108% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO totaled approximately $377 million, up 127% year-over-year.  We expect to recognize approximately 64% of the current RPO as revenue over the next 12 months compared to 68% in Q1 last year. We were pleased with the non-current RPO growth which signals growing long-term customer commitments to our platform. Operating cash flow was $22 million in Q1, up from $3 million in the same period a year ago. Free cash flow was $15 million in Q1, compared to negative $1 million in the same period a year ago. Both of these results reflect higher profitability and growth in deferred revenue.  Before I provide the outlook for Q2 and the full year, let me reiterate our investment strategy to drive our growth initiatives. As evident from our past results, we have both a highly efficient business model, and a proven track record of running the business in a disciplined manner. The end result has been rapid top line growth combined with positive non-GAAP operating income and free cash flow. Our customers\u2019 happiness and the rapid adoption of the Zoom platform are our top priorities, and we believe our focus on investing in the business will drive increased market share and future revenue growth.  Now turning specifically to the second quarter guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $129 million to $130 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $2 million to $3 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.01 to $0.02 based on approximately 301 million shares outstanding.  For the full year of fiscal 2020, we expect revenue to be in the range of $535 million to $540 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of breakeven to $3 million. This forecast includes the impact in Q3 of our premier user event, Zoomtopia. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.02 to $0.03, based on approximately 301 million shares outstanding. In closing, Q1 was a great start to our fiscal year. We had strong execution during our first quarter as a public company, and I would like to thank the entire Zoom team for their hard work. We delivered a combination of triple digit top line growth, increased profitability and positive free cash flow. We're also pleased with the high rate at which customers are embracing our platform. We believe this trust from customers and partners for Zoom will help drive additional growth. I'm excited about our execution this past quarter and the opportunity ahead for Zoom, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you. With that, let's open it up for questions. If you have not enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue-up our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley. Meta you are unmuted.\nMetaMarshall: Great, thank you and congrats on the quarter and thanks for the question. You gave a lot of detail on the revenue mix, but maybe versus expectations what was the biggest source of surprise during the cusp that quarter was a new customer adds, faster deployments, new products. And then maybe turn into new products, understanding it's so early but just any further details on Zoom phone traction and whether any of the upside guide to the fiscal 2020 guidance is due to kind of Zoom phone expectations? That's it for me. Thanks.\nEricYuan: Yes. Sure. So from product side, customer side, we do not see the biggest surprise and we work over so hard to make sure the customer happy. And one thing probably I'd like to highlight is Zoom phone and we announced that back in January and we do have some early adopters like a Ciena admission right, they put 5,000 licenses, I think this is something I think the probably we have us more in the future. Other than that I think we just focus on our customer and the product experience.\nKellySteckelberg: I think we're also excited about the continued progress we're making in the up market, as you saw our customers in that segment grew more quickly than our general customer base, which we continue to be really excited about. We had a really large financial services organization become a customer this quarter which were really happy about.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse. Brad you are unmuted.\nBradZelnick: Great. Nice to see you all and Eric nice to see how happy you are, congratulations on great quarter for Q1 as a public company. I have one question for you Eric and one follow-up for Kelly. For Eric, I appreciate that the IPO had to --have been fantastic branding events for you. Is there any discernible impact in terms of customer ads, free to paid conversion or even top of funnel development that you've noticed since becoming a public company?\nEricYuan: Yes. So, Brad, first of all, I like with your back on, thank you. I think since we became a public company I would see very little has changed and maybe it's too early to tell, but of course sure I think our company the brand is getting much bigger from our existing installed base, after became a public company I do receive so many emails from our customers and it really expressed the all the appreciation for whatever it did before with them right. And I think from branding perspective it has certainly helped us a lot. But it's too early to tell, maybe one more quarter I can share with you more.\nBradZelnick: Great and Kelly for you, if we look at your sales and marketing expense relative to the new customer ads, it would seem that you're losing some productivity per customer. How much of that is related to Zoom phone and how should we think about your productivity moving forward?\nKellySteckelberg: Yes. So we are really focused this year on continuing to hire in international and for Zoom phone. So you are going to see some impact initially as it takes a while for all those reps to get ramped. And I think when you start to get to the back half of this year early next year you should see that taking hold.\nOperator: Our next question is from cash Kasthuri Rangan with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Kash you are unmuted.\nKasthuriRangan: Hey, Zoom team, thank you so much. I'm very happy to be joining your video conference call. I had two questions for you. One with respect to the quarter what were the one or two largest deals the company landed in the quarter? And what were the competitive dynamics and also the nature of the topology of the customers, IT infrastructure against which you were able to win this a big deployment? And secondly, you just talked about the overlap on the phone side, how our customers making the phone decision? Is it in conjunction with the video decision or as a separate standalone capability? How are they making that evaluation? Thank you so much and congrats.\nEricYuan: Yes. So about your first question, feel free to tell me about some large customer required in Q1. I think you look at a competitive landscape in Q1, I do not think there are any changes because most of our legacy players still with old solution with old architecture. And I didn't see anything new from our legacy competitors in terms of innovation or some innovative go-to-market model and everything else I think it remains the same. \nKellySteckelberg: So we were really excited. We had four deals in the quarter that were over a $1 million ARR and unfortunately can't close the names of most of those, but one of them is a really exciting large financial institution. We're thrilled to have as a new customer and a couple of them were up sells. So positive traction I would say on all fronts in that area.\nEricYuan: I think Kash was on the decision to --\nKasthuriRangan: Yes, for the second question, Zoom phone, what drive that decision-making?\nEricYuan: So for -- when we look at our go-to-market strategy for our Zoom phone system, we focus on our existing installed base because they already trust us, plus they all use of video, they all use the voice. They realize our quality. Customer told us, hey, you just added a phone number right, they do not even use any other phone system. Customer like the quality, a unified collaboration experience and ease of use and plus some individual features like seamlessly obligate your phone call to the video call and the customer really like that experience.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan. Sterling you're unmuted.\nSterlingAuty: Alright, thanks. Hi, guys. Eric, one of the questions that I consistently got through the IPO and post is the direction of the [Ucash] stage and specifically with a lot punches Zoom phone it looks like you are actually in a competitive direction with RingCentral yet you announced the extension of your partnership. And also get questions over whether you need to actually own some of the technology that you see out of Slack. So just directionally how do you see your partnership and competition in directionally what technologies you need to own versus partner going forward?\nEricYuan: Yes. Sterling, that's a great question. So if you look at it what's happening in those -- in the industry and also when we talk with customers they take a Slack upon Zoom, Slack and Zoom I think the best of partners and a lot of companies standardized on Slack and Zoom, right. It's almost just become a standard right. It's very important but we look at it user space like a video and a phone and we started from building a platform and our first application good upon that platform is video conferencing and however customer realized our voice over IP quality, it's not very hard for us to edit a phone system into module phone system, we build our own technology from the ground up, it's modern architecture compared with any other phone system right.  We did it from the group up and customer really like that experience from a phone to the video and video to the phone is one unified collaborating space. \nSterlingAuty: Alright, great. Maybe just one follow-up. I do get questions over the US-China relations and things that are happening from that perspective given the large R&D presence that you have in China, does anything change in terms of how you're managing that aspect of the business?\nEricYuan: I don't think anything change especially if you look at our whole R&D down here in our headquarter office in San Jose. And then plus we're similar to a lot of other companies who might have office there. I think we do not have enough revenue. We do not have a big business there in China. And I think --I do not think there's any impact right. So we have very, very good, the process here in terms of how to manage office or team and we have a high confidence. I do not think there are any changes in Q1.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Hedberg with RBC. Matt, you are unmuted.\nMattHedberg: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking our questions and I love this new interface, hopefully other companies will maybe embrace the same idea for earnings calls. Kelly, I want to start with you, obviously, stellar results from the top line and bottom line and you've got a lot of success in international regions. Can you walk us through how you think about balancing growth and profitability? And I guess specifically how do you think about deploying direct sales reps out into the field? Especially as you're having more success in larger deals.\nKellySteckelberg: Yes. So we are really focused on investing in both R&D, as well as sales and marketing canoeing to build out the product, as well as expanding internationally. And if you look at our overall sales hires for this year about half of them are international which means as a percentage those sales reps are going to grow much more quickly than the US-based reps we have so many more here today. So I think we mentioned this on the roadshow but we recently hired a new Head of International, Abe Smith and he's really helping accelerate our business there. So I think you'll continue to see strong results there.\nMattHedberg: That's great. And then maybe as a follow-up, in addition to the RingCentral partnership, Salesforce.com is a good partner of you guys as well and participates in the IPO. Can you talk a little bit about that relationship and how embedded is it today? Because it seems like there's obviously a logical integration point between those two -- between yourself and Salesforce?\nEricYuan: Yes. So, Matt, you are right on. We are huge fan of Salesforce.com service. Our team and I believe within the Salesforce platform but quite often when you use a Salesforce and a Zoom, the integration do not stimulus. Our system manager really wants to understand what's going on for the Zoom meetings with the customer with the prospect. And they need to go back to the Zoom and what a week our meetings over, we automatically edit a transcription back to Salesforce portal, right. With that customer can leave within Salesforce portal. I think we have to do need more partnership, integrations with Salesforce.com which we truly believe I think the sales team in the future, they are going to either live within salesforce or they can use Zoom, but they do not feel like -- they are using two different solutions right. Some of these integrations can truly help the sales productivity.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pat Walravens with JMP. Pat you are unmuted.\nPatWalravens: Great, thank you and congratulations you guys. Eric my question is for you which is, I love your whole focus on delivering happiness. And I'm wondering given how fast you're growing how are you going to make sure that your employee stay happy so they can keep your customers happy? That's the first part. And the second part is there as much of an opportunity around Zoom phone as there was around meetings? Because just our -- the meetings areas such a disaster before you guys came along. I'm not sure the same level of, yes, right. And I am not sure there is same level of pain around the phone. So those are my two happiness questions.\nEricYuan: Yes. So, Pat, first of all, I think you are reading my mind very well and the first question about a company culture, if there's a one thing that keeps me up in the night is about a company culture. Before we have 1000 people I think I can remember most of the employees name. I never spend a minute on the people related issues, experience is great for now we have almost a 2,000 employees, quite often I need to spend time to deal with those people, you might have greater issues or maybe a sexual harassment and we needed that let them go right. It's not that easy, however, we try to do all we can to make sure that open, transparent culture. We just hired our Chief People Officer. We just launched the employee survey try to understand where we can improve. So we are very paranoid. We do all we can to make sure every employee happy every morning. If they are not happy we would like them to stay at home to figure out a root cause and either tells us what had happened and helps us to fix the problem. Again this is something not very easy. We keep an eye on that. We take it to that very, very seriously. Regarding your question, you're right. Before we build another Zoom platform, I build web as before right. I did not see a single happy web at customer, you're so right but when it comes to a phone system, you look a lot in device today, most of them are still using like complex old-fashioned on-prem systems but for the full system, and were hard to maintain and also quality not as great. Plus the phone system like a Pat I call you, we still talk on the phone, really cannot upgrade of video experience, but Zoom can truly have that and if you deploy Zoom phone system, I'll call your phone number one more click we can upgrade to a video experience seamlessly. I think the customers really like that.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc. Alex you are unmuted.\nAlexKurtz: Sorry about that. So, hey, guys. So just on the on the Cisco front, they've made some big efforts in the last six months to revamp the platform, the WebEx platform. They've done some integration at a high level. They've added some AI functions at least from a marketing perspective that's been out in the marketplace. So I'm just wondering during the quarter has there been any change in their competitive posture especially in the Global 2000. Then I had a follow-up question for Kelly.\nEricYuan: I think Cisco right on. They made -- I assume right decision to put on AI, but we already started AI effort two years ago. And like first feature were announced almost two years now right, so which is meeting transcription to lever AI platform after the meeting is over we can automatically generate the meeting transcription. We are going to [adopt] on that as well because we already started at two years ahead of any other competitors.\nAlexKurtz: Okay then Kelly just around the Zoom phone contribution to the updated view for the fiscal year. I guess at this point we're not calling out any kind of like contribution at this point right?\nKellySteckelberg: That's right. We're really excited about the momentum that we saw in Q1 but we're still at such an early phase that we expect it to have kind of minimal overall contribution the way that we're forecasting it for the full year.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Roderick with Stifel. Tom you are unmuted now. \nTomRoderick: Hey, thanks for the [chat], that's a question and congratulations on the IPO. I'll second Matt's earlier comment with regards to kudos on the format. I think this means you can't make faces at when you don't like our questions any more. May be good or may be bad for you. Eric, I'm going to start with you just on the topic of the IPO and taking back to when you started this the days of bootstrapping this company. You probably didn't foresee today when you have over $700 million cash in your balance sheet. So a bit of an embarrassment of riches. What do you do with all? I know the easy answer is everything but I'm sure as a backdrop of that is investors probably want to understand it just suddenly made you an acquisitive company. Do you want to someone rate the advertising and international markets as you have this big pile of cash? How do you think about -- how you want to deploy it now you focus your resources?\nEricYuan: So, Tom, you can ask these questions to my wife as well because I have a no idea how to spend money. I would like to refer to our CFO. \nKellySteckelberg: That's funny. Well, I think it's probably thanks to Eric that we have this cash because of what he just said, but we are continuing to invest, Tom. Certainly as I said mentioned before in R&D and sales marketing. Those are the two key focus areas and then while we haven't been acquisitive historically, Eric and I have talked a lot about this that we will keep looking for companies that we think could elevate our company in terms of technology or potentially personnel if that were needed. So we're keeping our options open at this point.\nTomRoderick: Fair enough, okay, good. Quick follow-up from me just in terms of the enterprise selling motion here and looking at the numbers, I mean the number of customers you've landed greater than 10 employees up over 80% but the enterprise contribution, they're up over after 120%. So as we think about the selling motions you get reps out of the field as you deploy more products. Can you just talk about how that selling motion has changed and how you'd like to further change that as you added layer more product in to the next? Thank you.\nKellySteckelberg: Yes. So certainly our enterprise cycles differ from like our SMB approach. And it's really interesting as we've seen a wide range of selling cycles in the enterprise. For example, one of our largest customers went from beginning to end in six weeks that was really a forward-looking CIO that embraced the need to digitize their platform. I will say that is not typical though. Most of our enterprise customers, they are what you expect more traditionally they have a proof-of-concept. They have pretty extensive user acceptance testing. I think what happens is once it's in the hands of the users though and they see there's a love for Zoom that drives the demand which then from that stage usually goes pretty quickly to close.\nEricYuan: Yes. And in particular for every enterprise customers normally we started from land and expand experience, right. We never wanted to let enterprise customer deploy Zoom with a full site is [brought on the one]. We like this bottom-up approach. That's why it will take some time but it's very healthy if you look at our pipeline.\nOperator: Our next question is from Zane Chrane from Bernstein. Zane, you're unmuted.\nZaneChrane: Can you hear me? Okay, great. Eric, Kelly, Tom, hi. Congratulations on the successful IPO, very nice to see you on the first earnings webinar. I have a question on your strategy for capturing marketing industry verticals. I know for example healthcare, telemedicine very rapid growing field. I understand from people in the industry that Zoom is really one of the only platforms; it's not for typical finance that ties in with the existing major electronic medical records. That seems to be maybe an underappreciated mode in that industry. How should we think about other examples such as that they have been in different industry verticals and how do you think about developing those industry strategies?\nEricYuan: I think you are right on; it comes to vertical industry opportunity, huge opportunity. However, we just cannot speak on that. The reason why, if you look at our video collaboration, the full system also the huge opportunity back to the $43 billion opportunity. For now, we also wanted to explore some ideas. That's the reason why we introduced the marketplace, make sure it speaks about our platform to let us sort of partners developers to build those application force based on our platform for whoever whenever we are ready. I mean you want a number on both video conferencing and a full system and are in working to top down on those vertical industries, huge opportunity you are right on. Is there any question? \nZaneChrane: And I was running have you guys had any work, doing work on quantifying how TAM expanded Zoom? It seems like Zoom is very kind of similar to a lot of other industries changing companies where a company comes in with a better product, easier to use, lower cost reduction, superior functionality. Is there any sense you have forged how much that's increasing the usage of video conferencing among knowledge workers or what multiple that is on legacy habits for video conferencing?\nEricYuan: So you look at the knowledge workers today worldwide more than 1 billion knowledge workers, but today if you look at the video usage, it is still very small. I think I just spoke on today's TAM, $43 billion of market size; we do not lose the focus I think it will keep us very busy next several years.\nZaneChrane: A huge opportunity, so congratulations, best wishes. \nOperator: Our next question is from Jonathan Kees with Summit Insights Group. Jonathan, you are unmuted now.\nJonathanKees: Great. Thanks for taking my question. I hope you can hear me here. I'm having trouble with my video here. Congratulations on the quarter. And I just, yes, I wanted to ask more of a modeling question. You've talked about for the quarter -- for the year, the top line and bottom line, just curious how we should think about cash flow. At the very least you can give us direction in terms of CapEx. And, yes, how we should model that for the year? Thanks.\nKellySteckelberg: Yes. Thanks for the question. We are not going to provide guidance around cash flow but given the opportunity that you're seeing in the top line, I think you should think about that there is a positive impact on cash flow due to that. And given that we're assesses in what you can see is happening also with the change in defers, I think you should think about that and what the impact it's having on cash.\nEricYuan: Yes. Also please let me know your mail address. I will mail you our new camera.\nJonathanKees: Okay, all right, I look forward, yes; we don't normally have video meetings. If I can sneak in one another question, this is more of a high-level. I guess I'm trying to reconcile the $43 billion TAM, talking with your task peers they're also pretty excited about the expansive TAM and how it's untapped and they're just a lot of potential upwards. I guess the TAM that they talk about and obviously this is for the voice, but also includes like contacts and even video. The TAM that they've talked on this even includes RingCentral, if you include contact center and maybe video you can get up to like around $40 billion in TAM. I guess I'm just trying to reconcile if you can help me here between the TAM that you talked about and the TAM that your peers talk about.\nKellySteckelberg: Yes. I mean the way that we, what we did we looked at IDC's approach and it's even a bigger TAM of like $60 billion but we looked at it and back down into the areas we could address with our platform today. And it is estimate by 2020 it's going to be at that $43 billion number. And I think the other thing you should think about which I don't know if you mentioned exactly as you talk about but also Zoom rooms which are a really important part of our platform and addressing the whole conference room is something that Zoom can do very uniquely because of our hardware agnostic approach. That there's a significant opportunity there that I'm not sure any of our competitors are addressing completely or maybe talking about and are --we're super excited about that opportunity. End of Q&A\nOperator: That is last question.\nEric Yuan: Okay, wonderful. Well, thank you everyone. Thank you for joining us by video. That's great and we will look forward to speaking to you guys again. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: By the way, please do send out your feedback. We really want to leverage Zoom Webinar for the future earnings call. Thank you so much for time. I really appreciate. Thank you very much.",

            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. And welcome to everyone joining us. Let me start by first reviewing financial results for Q1 and then I will discuss our outlook for Q2 and the full fiscal year. As Eric discussed, total revenue grew 103% year-over-year in the first quarter, to $122 million. Some of the key drivers of our revenue performance were our acquisition of new customers and the execution of our land and expand strategy with existing customers. Specifically, the year-over-year increase in revenue was split between subscription services provided to new customers which accounted for approximately64% of the increase while the remaining 36% increase was due to subscription services for existing customers. Here are some key customer metrics in Q1 that drove these results. We had over 58,500 customers with more than 10 employees, up nearly 86% year-over-year. We aren't just adding a large volume of new customers though. We are also winning larger customers as a result of our enterprise focus. For example, we are excited to announce, we added new customers including DocuSign and FICO. And customers of all size are deploying more Zoom products and users within their organizations as they realize the power of our platform. During the first quarter, we expanded our relationship with customers including Ciena and Take-Two Interactive. The combination of our land and expand strategy, along with our growing enterprise focus, resulted in 405 customers with more than $100,000 in revenue over the last 12 months, up 120% year-over-year. Overall, we have a loyal customer base, as evidenced by an exceptional net dollar expansion rate that has consistently been over 130% for the fourth consecutive quarter. Geographic expansion is another driver of our strong revenue growth as we continue to enjoy high demand and growth globally. Revenue in Q1 from the Americas was up 98% year-over-year and was approximately 80% of revenue.  Our APAC and EMEA revenue combined grew 127% year-over-year. We believe that this is only the beginning of a tremendous opportunity to bring the Zoom platform to customers around the world. To achieve this, we will make additional investments to expand our global footprint and drive additional growth. Now turning to profitability. Here you can see we were profitable from both a GAAP and non-GAAP perspective, but I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense. Non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter was up 17 basis points to 80.9%, compared to 80.7% in Q1 last year. Our non-GAAP gross margin reflects some additional investments to increase the redundancy of our infrastructure. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP gross margins to be at the low-end of our long-term target range of 80% to 82%. R&D expense in Q1 was $13 million and represented approximately 10% of total revenue. R&D remains a major investment area as we expand our platform with new features and capabilities every quarter. Approximately one-third of our workforce is R&D, however, it is lower as a percentage of revenue because we have a highly efficient global R&D model.  Sales and marketing expense for Q1 was $61 million, representing approximately 50% of total revenue. While we expect to realize leverage in sales and marketing over the long-term, we are currently focused on adding sales capacity to drive growth and capture the large TAM in front of us. These investments include ramping key strategic initiatives such as expanding our global footprint and building out our initial sales coverage for Zoom Phone.  G&A expense in Q1 was $16 million and represented 13% of total revenue. This includes costs associated with expanding our corporate functions to effectively operate as a public company. Non-GAAP operating income was $8 million translating to a 6.7% non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter. This was 8 percentage points improvement versus the modest non-GAAP operating loss in Q1 last year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q1 were $0.03, on approximately 290 million of non-GAAP, weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. Non-GAAP EPS increased three cents from Q1 of last year.  Turning to the balance sheet. We ended Q1 with approximately $737 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities which is up from $176 million at the end of Q4. The significant increase in cash was due primarily to$543 million of net proceeds from our IPO and our growth in cash flow from operations. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter grew to $149 million, up 108% year-over-year. Our remaining performance obligations or RPO totaled approximately $377 million, up 127% year-over-year.  We expect to recognize approximately 64% of the current RPO as revenue over the next 12 months compared to 68% in Q1 last year. We were pleased with the non-current RPO growth which signals growing long-term customer commitments to our platform. Operating cash flow was $22 million in Q1, up from $3 million in the same period a year ago. Free cash flow was $15 million in Q1, compared to negative $1 million in the same period a year ago. Both of these results reflect higher profitability and growth in deferred revenue.  Before I provide the outlook for Q2 and the full year, let me reiterate our investment strategy to drive our growth initiatives. As evident from our past results, we have both a highly efficient business model, and a proven track record of running the business in a disciplined manner. The end result has been rapid top line growth combined with positive non-GAAP operating income and free cash flow. Our customers' happiness and the rapid adoption of the Zoom platform are our top priorities, and we believe our focus on investing in the business will drive increased market share and future revenue growth.  Now turning specifically to the second quarter guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect revenue in the range of $129 million to $130 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $2 million to $3 million, with non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.01 to $0.02 based on approximately 301 million shares outstanding.  For the full year of fiscal 2020, we expect revenue to be in the range of $535 million to $540 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income in the range of breakeven to $3 million. This forecast includes the impact in Q3 of our premier user event, Zoomtopia. Non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $0.02 to $0.03, based on approximately 301 million shares outstanding. In closing, Q1 was a great start to our fiscal year. We had strong execution during our first quarter as a public company, and I would like to thank the entire Zoom team for their hard work. We delivered a combination of triple digit top line growth, increased profitability and positive free cash flow. We're also pleased with the high rate at which customers are embracing our platform. We believe this trust from customers and partners for Zoom will help drive additional growth. I'm excited about our execution this past quarter and the opportunity ahead for Zoom, and I look forward to sharing our progress with you. With that, let's open it up for questions. If you have not enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue-up our first question. I think we're also excited about the continued progress we're making in the up market, as you saw our customers in that segment grew more quickly than our general customer base, which we continue to be really excited about. We had a really large financial services organization become a customer this quarter which were really happy about. Yes. So we are really focused this year on continuing to hire in international and for Zoom phone. So you are going to see some impact initially as it takes a while for all those reps to get ramped. And I think when you start to get to the back half of this year early next year you should see that taking hold. So we were really excited. We had four deals in the quarter that were over a $1 million ARR and unfortunately can't close the names of most of those, but one of them is a really exciting large financial institution. We're thrilled to have as a new customer and a couple of them were up sells. So positive traction I would say on all fronts in that area. Yes. So we are really focused on investing in both R&D, as well as sales and marketing canoeing to build out the product, as well as expanding internationally. And if you look at our overall sales hires for this year about half of them are international which means as a percentage those sales reps are going to grow much more quickly than the US-based reps we have so many more here today. So I think we mentioned this on the roadshow but we recently hired a new Head of International, Abe Smith and he's really helping accelerate our business there. So I think you'll continue to see strong results there. That's right. We're really excited about the momentum that we saw in Q1 but we're still at such an early phase that we expect it to have kind of minimal overall contribution the way that we're forecasting it for the full year. That's funny. Well, I think it's probably thanks to Eric that we have this cash because of what he just said, but we are continuing to invest, Tom. Certainly as I said mentioned before in R&D and sales marketing. Those are the two key focus areas and then while we haven't been acquisitive historically, Eric and I have talked a lot about this that we will keep looking for companies that we think could elevate our company in terms of technology or potentially personnel if that were needed. So we're keeping our options open at this point. Yes. So certainly our enterprise cycles differ from like our SMB approach. And it's really interesting as we've seen a wide range of selling cycles in the enterprise. For example, one of our largest customers went from beginning to end in six weeks that was really a forward-looking CIO that embraced the need to digitize their platform. I will say that is not typical though. Most of our enterprise customers, they are what you expect more traditionally they have a proof-of-concept. They have pretty extensive user acceptance testing. I think what happens is once it's in the hands of the users though and they see there's a love for Zoom that drives the demand which then from that stage usually goes pretty quickly to close. Yes. Thanks for the question. We are not going to provide guidance around cash flow but given the opportunity that you're seeing in the top line, I think you should think about that there is a positive impact on cash flow due to that. And given that we're assesses in what you can see is happening also with the change in defers, I think you should think about that and what the impact it's having on cash. Yes. I mean the way that we, what we did we looked at IDC's approach and it's even a bigger TAM of like $60 billion but we looked at it and back down into the areas we could address with our platform today. And it is estimate by 2020 it's going to be at that $43 billion number. And I think the other thing you should think about which I don't know if you mentioned exactly as you talk about but also Zoom rooms which are a really important part of our platform and addressing the whole conference room is something that Zoom can do very uniquely because of our hardware agnostic approach. That there's a significant opportunity there that I'm not sure any of our competitors are addressing completely or maybe talking about and are --we're super excited about that opportunity. End of Q&A Thank you."

            "name": "Eric Yuan",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom. Thank you all. So, first of all, welcome to all of you joining us on today's Zoom video webinar. I really appreciate. And hopefully after the webinar all of you can give us some feedback and of course we really want to leverage our platform for the future earnings call. Like a brag, I like you all what you brag on. Please tell about what you brag on. So this is our first earnings announcement as a public company and I am pleased to report that we delivered revenue of $122 million for the first quarter, an increase of 103% year-over-year.  In addition to tremendous growth at scale, we are also pleased that our highly efficient business model and disciplined investments contributed to positive profitability and free cash flow. Our strong first quarter results are evidence that organizations are turning to Zoom as a strategic technology partner to help them increase communications and collaboration.  Since this is our first earnings call as a public company, I would like to take a step back to share how Zoom's video first approach delivers happiness to our customers. First, we deliver a single, easy to use platform. Second, we are 100% Cloud-Native and hardware agnostic. Third, we offer high quality service globally. Fourth, we offer robust mobile functionality. Fifth, we are developer friendly with open APIs also with the market place. We believe the growth opportunity for Zoom is significant. Based on IDC estimates the markets opportunity at TAM is huge, $43 billion dollar market by 2022. But we believe that it is even larger than that as we are in the early stages of video becoming the new voice.  Our platform is fundamentally transforming the way organizations of all sizes communicate. Zoom is enabling far greater effectiveness and intimacy in human-to-human interactions over a distance, and we are witnessing the rapid adoption of Zoom for diverse use cases that were not possible with legacy technology. So let me give you an example of how our customers leverage Zoom platform. One company Ciena, networking systems, services and Software Company has been a Zoom customer, happy customer for the last two years. They have built up to a full site deployment of Zoom including Zoom Rooms, Zoom Webinar and our premium audio.  They have transformed how they conduct business and communicate with a video first culture. They are currently doing more than 10 million minutes a month on Zoom platform. When faced with replacing their legacy very complex PBX infrastructure, they turned to Zoom and Ciena was very impressed with capabilities of Zoom Phone system. So we closed a deal with Ciena in Q1 that brings their Zoom Phone licenses to 5,000 users, while significantly expanding the use of the Zoom platform within their organization. This is a great example of the trust customers have in Zoom.  Now let me discuss a few recent business and technology highlights that further reinforce our long-term growth opportunity. First, we announced that our FedRAMP authorization has been approved, with the sponsorship of the US Department of Homeland Security. This authorization allows US Federal Government agencies and contractors to securely use Zoom for video meetings, API integrations, and more.  Second, we continued to build out our best of breed partnerships with deeper relationships like HP, Salesforce.com and Slack. Many companies, they standardize on Zoom and Slack platform, that sort of like standard for collaboration. Third, we continued to enhance our core technologies that have disrupted the video communications market. During the Enterprise Connect in March, we announced additional Smart features to Zoom meetings such as real-time transcriptions. And fourth, we continue to enhance and extend the reach of Zoom Phone. We announced new features that enable Zoom Phone to elevate voice calls to Zoom Video meetings seamlessly, a bring your own carrier service and a new beta for Zoom Phone service for both the UK and Australia. In summary, I'd like to thank our nearly 2,000 Zoom employees around the globe for an exceptional performance in our first quarter as a public company. Our industry leading, video-first architecture, viral adoption model, and large TAM, were also positive factors to our remarkable results this quarter. It was a great start for the year, and we are excited about the growth opportunities in front of us. We truly believe zoom is well positioned to capitalize on the transformation of how companies communicate and collaborate with their employees, partners and customers.  In many ways we are helping to drive this transformation. The strategy that we have employed over the years to make our customers happy with a frictionless communications platform is working, and it continues to deliver remarkable results.  With that, let me turn things over to Kelly. Yes. Sure. So from product side, customer side, we do not see the biggest surprise and we work over so hard to make sure the customer happy. And one thing probably I'd like to highlight is Zoom phone and we announced that back in January and we do have some early adopters like a Ciena admission right, they put 5,000 licenses, I think this is something I think the probably we have us more in the future. Other than that I think we just focus on our customer and the product experience. Yes. So, Brad, first of all, I like with your back on, thank you. I think since we became a public company I would see very little has changed and maybe it's too early to tell, but of course sure I think our company the brand is getting much bigger from our existing installed base, after became a public company I do receive so many emails from our customers and it really expressed the all the appreciation for whatever it did before with them right. And I think from branding perspective it has certainly helped us a lot. But it's too early to tell, maybe one more quarter I can share with you more. Yes. So about your first question, feel free to tell me about some large customer required in Q1. I think you look at a competitive landscape in Q1, I do not think there are any changes because most of our legacy players still with old solution with old architecture. And I didn't see anything new from our legacy competitors in terms of innovation or some innovative go-to-market model and everything else I think it remains the same. I think Kash was on the decision to -- So for -- when we look at our go-to-market strategy for our Zoom phone system, we focus on our existing installed base because they already trust us, plus they all use of video, they all use the voice. They realize our quality. Customer told us, hey, you just added a phone number right, they do not even use any other phone system. Customer like the quality, a unified collaboration experience and ease of use and plus some individual features like seamlessly obligate your phone call to the video call and the customer really like that experience. Yes. Sterling, that's a great question. So if you look at it what's happening in those -- in the industry and also when we talk with customers they take a Slack upon Zoom, Slack and Zoom I think the best of partners and a lot of companies standardized on Slack and Zoom, right. It's almost just become a standard right. It's very important but we look at it user space like a video and a phone and we started from building a platform and our first application good upon that platform is video conferencing and however customer realized our voice over IP quality, it's not very hard for us to edit a phone system into module phone system, we build our own technology from the ground up, it's modern architecture compared with any other phone system right.  We did it from the group up and customer really like that experience from a phone to the video and video to the phone is one unified collaborating space. I don't think anything change especially if you look at our whole R&D down here in our headquarter office in San Jose. And then plus we're similar to a lot of other companies who might have office there. I think we do not have enough revenue. We do not have a big business there in China. And I think --I do not think there's any impact right. So we have very, very good, the process here in terms of how to manage office or team and we have a high confidence. I do not think there are any changes in Q1. Yes. So, Matt, you are right on. We are huge fan of Salesforce.com service. Our team and I believe within the Salesforce platform but quite often when you use a Salesforce and a Zoom, the integration do not stimulus. Our system manager really wants to understand what's going on for the Zoom meetings with the customer with the prospect. And they need to go back to the Zoom and what a week our meetings over, we automatically edit a transcription back to Salesforce portal, right. With that customer can leave within Salesforce portal. I think we have to do need more partnership, integrations with Salesforce.com which we truly believe I think the sales team in the future, they are going to either live within salesforce or they can use Zoom, but they do not feel like -- they are using two different solutions right. Some of these integrations can truly help the sales productivity. Yes. So, Pat, first of all, I think you are reading my mind very well and the first question about a company culture, if there's a one thing that keeps me up in the night is about a company culture. Before we have 1000 people I think I can remember most of the employees name. I never spend a minute on the people related issues, experience is great for now we have almost a 2,000 employees, quite often I need to spend time to deal with those people, you might have greater issues or maybe a sexual harassment and we needed that let them go right. It's not that easy, however, we try to do all we can to make sure that open, transparent culture. We just hired our Chief People Officer. We just launched the employee survey try to understand where we can improve. So we are very paranoid. We do all we can to make sure every employee happy every morning. If they are not happy we would like them to stay at home to figure out a root cause and either tells us what had happened and helps us to fix the problem. Again this is something not very easy. We keep an eye on that. We take it to that very, very seriously. Regarding your question, you're right. Before we build another Zoom platform, I build web as before right. I did not see a single happy web at customer, you're so right but when it comes to a phone system, you look a lot in device today, most of them are still using like complex old-fashioned on-prem systems but for the full system, and were hard to maintain and also quality not as great. Plus the phone system like a Pat I call you, we still talk on the phone, really cannot upgrade of video experience, but Zoom can truly have that and if you deploy Zoom phone system, I'll call your phone number one more click we can upgrade to a video experience seamlessly. I think the customers really like that. I think Cisco right on. They made -- I assume right decision to put on AI, but we already started AI effort two years ago. And like first feature were announced almost two years now right, so which is meeting transcription to lever AI platform after the meeting is over we can automatically generate the meeting transcription. We are going to [adopt] on that as well because we already started at two years ahead of any other competitors. So, Tom, you can ask these questions to my wife as well because I have a no idea how to spend money. I would like to refer to our CFO. Yes. And in particular for every enterprise customers normally we started from land and expand experience, right. We never wanted to let enterprise customer deploy Zoom with a full site is [brought on the one]. We like this bottom-up approach. That's why it will take some time but it's very healthy if you look at our pipeline. I think you are right on; it comes to vertical industry opportunity, huge opportunity. However, we just cannot speak on that. The reason why, if you look at our video collaboration, the full system also the huge opportunity back to the $43 billion opportunity. For now, we also wanted to explore some ideas. That's the reason why we introduced the marketplace, make sure it speaks about our platform to let us sort of partners developers to build those application force based on our platform for whoever whenever we are ready. I mean you want a number on both video conferencing and a full system and are in working to top down on those vertical industries, huge opportunity you are right on. Is there any question? So you look at the knowledge workers today worldwide more than 1 billion knowledge workers, but today if you look at the video usage, it is still very small. I think I just spoke on today's TAM, $43 billion of market size; we do not lose the focus I think it will keep us very busy next several years. Yes. Also please let me know your mail address. I will mail you our new camera. Okay, wonderful. Well, thank you everyone. Thank you for joining us by video. That's great and we will look forward to speaking to you guys again. Thank you. By the way, please do send out your feedback. We really want to leverage Zoom Webinar for the future earnings call. Thank you so much for time. I really appreciate. Thank you very much."

This call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to hand things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Matt. Let me jump right into the presentation here. This is my favorite cool Zoom Meeting feature, slides as a virtual background. Let me just center myself here, so I don\u2019t cover up the wording. And so, hello, everyone. Welcome to Zoom\u2019s earnings video webinar for the fourth quarter of fiscal \u201821. Joining me today will be Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan and Zoom\u2019s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg.

Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today\u2019s webinar. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Tom. First of all, I am not a cat. I\u2019m live here. So thank you all and welcome, everyone, joining us on today\u2019s Zoom Video webinar. Fiscal year 2021 was truly a pivotal year for Zoom characterized by achieving unprecedented success and overcoming tremendous challenges. My heartfelt appreciation goes out to our approximately 4,400 employees for their incredible energy, perseverance and dedication. Their focus on delivering happiness and building trust enabled us to become a household name and one of the most popular apps of the year. We are so grateful to our customers, partners, investors and the entire community for trusting us during these COVID times; and are humbled to see workers, students and families log to our platform and use it in increasingly in innovative ways to connect, contribute and collaborate. As the world emerges from the pandemic, our work has only begun. The future is here with the rise of remote and work-from-anywhere trends. We recognize this new reality and are helping to empower our own employees and those of our customers to work and thrive in a distributed manner. As companies begin their safe return to the office and reimagine their working models, Zoom is here to help, leading the transformation with an extensive and growing portfolio of offerings and product features. For example, Zoom Room enhancement connected seamlessly with Zoom Meetings enabling features like Virtual Reception, Smart Gallery and more, to provide a secure, inclusive and empowering work-from-anywhere experience. Our evolution from a leading video communications app into a video communications platform will strengthen our position in the new normal by providing customers with a growing set of innovative and integrated collaboration and productivity tools. We are very energized to help lead the evolution to enable the future of work that allows greater flexibility for both in-person and virtual connections, a future that we believe will be better for the planet, productivity and employee happiness. Next, as part of Zoom Phone\u2019s second anniversary, I\u2019d like to highlight some exciting deals where we harness the power of the channel to secure large enterprise rollouts of Zoom Phone. We are optimistic about the growth in our channel partners, including master agents who work as a liaison between customers and the telecommunications world. These channel partners are force multipliers and have proven to be strong advocates for us. So, let me share a few happy customers\u2019 stories. We are grateful to have the University of Southern California as a longstanding Zoom Meetings and a new Zoom Phone customer. Our commitment to USC and broad higher education was rewarded when the university and their master agent short-listed us in an extensive vendor review to modernize their phone systems. After a six months evaluation of the UCaaS vendors, USC chose to deploy 21,000 Zoom Phone seats. We are so thankful that USC put their trust in Zoom to deliver an increasingly comprehensive and integrated set of communications services. Another highlight this quarter was the expansion with Equinix, the world\u2019s digital infrastructure company, enabling digital leaders to harness a platform to bring it together and interconnect the foundational infrastructure that powers their success. Equinix has been a Zoom customer for several years and use Zoom Meetings and Zoom Rooms for its global employees to communicate and collaborate. We recently expanded their partnership by adding Zoom Phones with over 10,000 seats. On top of being seamlessly integrated with Zoom Meetings and Rooms, they chose Zoom Phone for our global footprint, our ability to serve Equinix data centers with zero-touch provisioning and our advanced features over other UCaaS offerings. Let me also welcome a direct sales win. We are very happy to announce that Universal Music Group, the world\u2019s leading musical company, is adopting Zoom Phone for its global workforce. UMG was looking to replace and consolidate legacy on-prem technologies with flexible, cloud PBX solutions. As an existing Zoom Meetings and Azure customers, UMG was drawn to the integrated nature of the Zoom Phone product. They will be using Zoom United, which will provide their global users with a one touch experience of video, chat and voice. Thank you, UMG. These stories are not exceptions. Enterprise customers choose to replace their legacy phone system because of their positive experiences with our high-quality products that are very easy use and are well integrated. With the value of our rapid innovation circles and ability to scale for large and global deployments, they also look to us to partner with them to deliver a unified communication solution that will make their users happy and productive. Thank you, Equinix, USC, UMG and our supportive channel partners. I love you all. With that, let me turn things over to Kelly.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric, and hello, everybody. As Eric mentioned, FY 2021 was a pivotal year for us. While the pandemic stress tested our operations, it also accelerated our growth opportunities. According to Okta\u2019s 2021 Business Network Report, which relies upon data from Okta\u2019s customers, Zoom was by far the preferred enterprise video conferencing app ranked among the most popular workplace apps overall. And we\u2019re the top app by number of customers and active unique users. In addition, analyst firm Frost & Sullivan recently recognized Zoom with its 2020 Company of the Year award, honoring Zoom\u2019s dedication to providing customers with innovative solutions that drive growth and deliver new capabilities. Thank you to our amazing customers who made these accolades possible. Bolstering the growth of our product portfolio is Zoom Phone, which has grown incredibly and turned two last quarter. We believe the opportunity ahead is significant as the TAM for telephony is forecasted to grow to $23 billion by 2024. We have seen wins from legacy on-prem providers as well as other cloud PBX vendors. Here are a few milestones to mark the anniversary. Illustrating the ability of Zoom Phone to meet the needs for large-scale enterprise rollouts, Zoom Phone finished FY \u201821 with 18 customers, each with over 10,000 paid seats. We closed FY \u201821 with approximately 10,700 Zoom Phone customers with more than 10 employees, up 269% year-over-year. We continued to drive broad adoption across industries and customer sizes. We are 60% within the mass market and 40% from the up market. With our base of approximately 467,000 customers with more than 10 employees and our growing channel presence, Zoom Phone is in a strong position as customers look to modernize their phone systems to an integrated communications platform. Now getting into the results, let me start with a few of the financial highlights and then for the full year. I will review our financial results for Q4 and finally, our outlook for Q1 and the full year of FY \u201822. Revenue grew 326% to $2.7 billion as we exited the fiscal year at an annualized run rate of $3.5 billion. We grew non-GAAP operating margin to 37.1%, up from 14.2% in FY \u201820. Free cash flow grew by over 12x to $1.4 billion for the full year. In Q4, total revenue grew 369% year-over-year to $882 million. This top line result exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $811 million due to strong sales and marketing execution in online, direct and channel businesses as well as lower-than-expected churn. The demand was widespread across products, industry verticals, geographies, new logos and customer cohorts. The year-over-year growth in revenue for the quarter was mainly driven by the sharp increase in new customers this year, which accounted for approximately 80% of the incremental revenue, up from 59% in Q4 of last year. We continue to add customers of all sizes and across industries that we anticipate will provide future up-sell opportunities. Let\u2019s take a look at the key customer metrics for the quarter. We continue to see expansion in the up market as we ended the quarter with 1,644 customers generating more than $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue, up 156% year-over-year and 28% quarter-over-quarter. This is an increase of 355 customers sequentially, the highest number of quarterly net adds for this segment. We made great progress in the up market and still see a lot of opportunity ahead. For example, we grew the number of Global 2000 customers generating at least $100,000 of ARR by more than 100% this year, but that still accounts for only 14% of the total population. We exited the quarter with approximately 467,000 customers with more than 10 employees, adding approximately 33,000 customers during the quarter and 385,000 customers during the year. In Q4, customers with more than 10 employees represented approximately 63% of revenue. We also continued to benefit from significant growth in our segment of customers with 10 or fewer employees. In Q4, customers with 10 or fewer employees represented approximately 37% of revenue, up from 20% in Q4 last year and down modestly from 38% in Q3. Our net dollar expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees exceeded 130% for the 11th consecutive quarter, as existing customers acquired more Zoom Meeting licenses, Rooms, webinars and Zoom Phone products. We value their trust in us to build their unified communications on Zoom. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Our Americas revenue grew over 292% year-over-year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew 687% year-over-year to be 33% of revenue, up from 20% a year ago. In FY \u201822, we intend to make additional investments in international resources to further capitalize on the global opportunity. Now turning to profitability, the increase in demand and strong execution drove net income profitability from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock, and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter was 71.3% compared to 84.2% in Q4 last year and 68.2% in Q3. The year-over-year decline in our gross margin is partially due to the dramatic increase in free usage related to the pandemic, including our ongoing commitment to support approximately 125,000 K-12 domains as well as the higher utilization of public cloud services. The sequential improvement mainly relates to seasonal audio usage, which decreases during the holiday season. We would expect gross margins to remain around 70% as long as we continue to support free K-12 education. Research and development expense grew by 91% year-over-year to approximately $31 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense was approximately 3.5%, which is lower than in Q4 of FY \u201820 mainly due to the strong top line growth. Though we made strides in expanding our team, we remain committed to prioritizing R&D hiring and continuing to grow in order to drive further innovation, expansion and security on our platform. Sales and marketing expense grew by 90% year-over-year to $159 million. This reflects an additional $75 million over last year, primarily due to investments in hiring to drive future growth. Sales and marketing expense was approximately 18.1% of total revenue, a decrease from Q4 of FY \u201820 mainly due to strong top line growth. We plan to continue to invest in adding sales capacity and product marketing programs over the next several quarters, focused on capturing market share. G&A expense in the quarter grew by 291% to $78 million as we continued to scale our G&A functions and invest heavily in security and compliance headcount and professional services. G&A expense was approximately 8.8% of total revenue, a decrease from Q4 of FY \u201820. The revenue upside in the quarter carried through to the bottom line, with non-GAAP operating income of $361 million exceeding our guidance. This translates to a 40.9% non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter, a large improvement from 20.4% in Q4 last year and steady improvement from 37.4% in Q3. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4, was $1.22 on approximately 301 million non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.43 above the high end of our guidance and $1.07 higher than Q4 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue at the end of the period was $883 million, up 283% year-over-year from $231 million. Also, please note we have seen a shift in the mix of invoicing to approximately 50% of business being billed monthly, up from approximately 40% in the previous year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $1.8 billion, up 190% year-over-year from $604 million. The increase in RPO is consistent with the strong demand and execution in the quarter. We expect to recognize approximately 70% or $1.2 billion of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 62% or $375 million in Q4 of FY \u201820. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding restricted cash. This balance includes approximately $2 billion from our follow-on public offering in January. We had exceptional operating cash flow in the quarter of $399 million, up from $37 million in Q4 last year. Free cash flow was $378 million, up from $27 million in Q4 last year. The increase is primarily attributable to strong billings and collections. Looking into FY \u201822, we expect to increase our capital expenditures related to the build-out of our data center infrastructure to support our growth outlook and drive additional efficiencies. Now turning to guidance, we are pleased to announce our outlook for FY \u201822 for both revenue and non-GAAP profitability. Although we remain optimistic on Zoom\u2019s outlook, please note the impact and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and people returning to in-person contact still remains largely unknown. Our outlook is based on our current assessment of the business environment. For the first quarter of FY \u201822, we expect revenue to be in the range of $900 million to $905 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $295 million to $300 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.95 to $0.97 based on approximately 307 million shares outstanding. Both Q1 and full year share count include the additional shares issued in our follow-on public offering. For the full year of FY \u201822, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.76 billion to $3.78 billion, which would represent approximately 42% to 43% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion, which would represent approximately 14% to 16% year-over-year growth. Our outlook for the non-GAAP earnings per share is $3.59 to $3.65 based on approximately 311 million shares outstanding. Before concluding, I am happy to highlight that today we announced the first group of grant recipients from our EdInnovation Awards program. This is part of our Zoom Care\u2019s philanthropic program under our ESG umbrella. We are excited to support their work, which includes promoting diversity from within the teaching profession, entrepreneurial and job training, assisting and inspiring youth in conflict-affected areas to join the digital economy and providing access to science-based approaches to reading education. We are proud to sponsor these critical and innovative education efforts around the world and support the next generation of talent. As we look forward to FY \u201822, Zoom is grateful to be a driving force, enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless and secure communications platform. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community and our investors. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of our meeting. Matt, please queue up our first question.\nOperator: Our first question is from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc.\nAlex Kurtz: Yes. Thanks for the question, and I hope everyone at Zoom is doing well. So, could you frame how much Zoom Phone versus new customers versus the expansion opportunity is driving the fiscal 2022 growth outlook? And as part of that, what churn rates are you assuming as return to office ramps later in the year? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, Alex, we are really excited about the opportunity of Zoom Phone ahead. As you have heard, they performed very well this year. They were \u2013 the Zoom Phone was the fastest-growing product line quarter-over-quarter in Q4 and we expect to see strong growth as we look towards FY 2022. As you remember, our strategy is to sell into our existing install base. So based on the customers that we have today, we see tremendous opportunity for further up-sells with Zoom Phone. And then high level in terms of the churn rates, we have seen churn like \u2013 churn rates stabilize in the back half of FY 2021. And we do though \u2013 they are certainly elevated from pre-pandemic period and we have assumed that to continue as we move through FY 2022 and the uncertainty around when people will be able to start to safely move around the world again.\nAlex Kurtz: Yes, thank you.\nTom McCallum: Next question please, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Will Power with Baird.\nWill Power: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Yes, I wanted to touch on Zoom Phone as well, terrific to see the strong results. I wonder if you could help us understand where you are in the evolution of rolling out channel partners. It sounds like that was a key contributor to some of the bigger customer additions. How much more is there to go? How much more of an acceleration could we expect there? And I guess tied to that, as you look at these bigger wins, the 10,000 seat paid customers, what\u2019s really helping differentiate you versus the other cloud providers out there?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So, that\u2019s a great question. First of all, if you look at why our customers, they choose Zoom or other cloud-based PBX solutions. First of all, you look at our existing customers, we already got their trust. They really enjoyed other very high-quality products, because of that, they would like to test the Zoom. After they have tested Zoom, they realize Zoom Phone. After they test that realize it\u2019s feature-rich, very reliable, very easy to use, modern architecture, integrated very well with our meetings, Zoom Rooms and other product lines. So as I said, from current perspective, we have high confidence. From a distribution perspective, not only did they drive the other growth from our delivery team and you see like the U.S. account, right, driven by Master Agent. I think we are doubling on that channel partners, especially look at the history of the Zoom cloud-based PBX growth, primarily driven by the channel partners. I think our strategy to focus on building a greater partnership with channel partners such as Master Agent, are really paying off. I think we are working to double down on that.\nWill Power: Congratulations. Good luck.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Will.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Hedberg with RBC.\nMatt Hedberg: Okay, thanks for taking my questions, guys, and congrats really on a stellar year. Momentum with the G2K customers over $100,000 in ARR was certainly impressive, but it still remains just vastly underpenetrated relative to your overall population. Can you talk about incremental steps you are looking at in fiscal 2022 to driving faster G2K or further G2K adoption? And then maybe just as a follow-up for Kelly, $4.2 billion in cash exiting the year, just thoughts on deploying that, just sort of \u2013 obviously, there is some CapEx expenditures, but just broader CapEx or cash expenditures?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Maybe, Matt, I can address the first part of your question. You are absolutely right it\u2019s only 14% of Global 2K customers. So, the reason why you look at our history, the way for us to grow our revenue, our user base is from the bottom up from 1 user, 2 user; one department to multiple department and we talk to the CIO, right? And we are doing something similar. That\u2019s why there is huge opportunity ahead of us. Because last year, I think that if you have talked with the enterprise customers, if you do not have a very strong brand, normally they even do not want to talk with you, right? Because last year I think Zoom has become a household brand, I think we have more and more opportunities in the pipeline and people like to talk with us now, not only from bottom-up, but also from the top down as well. Having said that, I think the rest of the Global 2K customer is basically look at international and the growth opportunity. I think the future is bright as long as we keep focusing on execution.\nKelly Steckelberg: In terms of what we are going to do with that $4.2 billion, so we, as you said, we are certainly investing in building out more data center infrastructure. And we are constantly looking for opportunities for other interesting companies, potentially M&A activity, that could add either to our talent or our technology. It\u2019s just as I\u2019m sure all of you know, Eric, has a very high bar for both. And so we just haven\u2019t quite found the right match yet, but we keep looking. Colin leads our corporate dev team, and his team are just constantly looking and seeing what\u2019s out there. It looks interesting. So we will see. We are certainly open to it. It\u2019s just finding the right match for us.\nMatt Hedberg: Thanks. Well done, guys.\nEric Yuan: By the way, Matt, if any of you have any great advice in how to do that, no, we will love all those advice. Thank you.\nMatt Hedberg: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. So were you successful in rolling out all of the countries that you wanted to for Zoom Phone during calendar 2020, what\u2019s the plan for 2021? And can you eliminate the need for the bring your own carrier program that you launched with?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So first of all, if you look at our international penetration, 42 countries you look at our Zoom Phone and the service. I think look at our Phone, the growth, 40% are from the upper market, 60% are from SMB market. If you talk about the upper market, I think more and more opportunities will come from international customers. The reason why we started, we lead the folks on North American market since last calendar year. As we started rolling out to more and more international customers, I think the international penetration, I think will be the catalyst for our future Zoom Phone growth.\nSterling Auty: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. As you think about leveraging your platform, Digital Events is something you talked about at Zoomtopia with Zoom as another kind of natural adjacency, any traction here to call out on Zoom or just how do you think about kind of finding other use cases or platforms for video usage?\nEric Yuan: Yes, Kelly, feel free to chime in. Actually in terms of Zoom, we launched [indiscernible] announced that at last October at a Zoom annual user conference, but now it\u2019s in the beta stage now, right. So \u2013 and based on our talk with those early adopters and also based on the progress, we think Zoom is not only designed for the knowledge workers, but more a consumer, right, to learn the [indiscernible] class. And also another part of on Zoom is about the overall biggest customer, enterprise customer online virtual event. This year at Zoomtopia, we will hold that event complete event on Zoom platform, essentially Zoom had two parts, consumer-driven on Zoom to allow workers to make a living to sell a yoga class, teaching anything online on our Zoom platform. And also we are beginning to expand our revenue platform to be our end-to-end corporate virtual event platform. That market also has huge growth opportunity.\nMeta Marshall: Okay, thanks guys.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Philip Winslow with Wells Fargo.\nPhilip Winslow: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I also just wanted to dig in on Zoom Phone one of the things that jumped out at me was the 18 customers with more than 10,000 seats. I was wondering is there any sort of I guess cohorts, so to speak, what you are seeing here? Are these larger customers from a particular industry? Is their workforce more distributed than others? I mean anything that you comment on and sort of how \u2013 sort of what the type of customer profile is for Zoom Phone, especially with those bigger transactions and how you think about that going forward?\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi. I think the great news, Phil, is that it\u2019s actually spread across all industries. You saw those names that we talked about, right. We had a university. We had an entertainment organization and a technology company. And that\u2019s been \u2013 I think the success of Zoom Phone from the very beginning is it\u2019s really appealed well to small and large enterprises alike and across all industries. And the reason that we win right is based on, as Eric mentioned, the trust that they already have in as well as the usability and the total cost of ownership, which plays well across all industries.\nEric Yuan: Yes.\nPhilip Winslow: Got it. And then just to follow-up on that, theoretically as companies are ramping up to return to office, how do you think about the opportunity for Zoom Phone and also additional penetration for Zoom Rooms as sort of with people not being there, it\u2019s easy to take away my phone at my desk, but nobody use any conference room, it\u2019s maybe easier to upgrade it to Zoom Room. How do you think about sort of the first half there in particular as people prep for potentially return to office?\nEric Yuan: Yes, Phil. Yes, first of all, we all want to go back to the office, right. We are stuck in our home for such a long time, so painful, but actually even if we all go back to the office, I think the product videoconferencing is well expected for the growth, but most importantly is customers who would like to consolidate it. Now, phone and video are the same thing, [indiscernible] why do they need to have another system? Why don\u2019t they deploy the hardware back to the phone? But essentially Zoom Phone already give you everything. I think in the past, also Zoom Phone is very well integrated with Zoom Meetings and Zoom Rooms, right. A lot of companies are talking about how to read into the office, especially focused on the conference room system. Recently our innovations, like a Virtual Reception, like Smart Gallery plus Zoom Phone, those two can really help us give customers unified collaboration and communication experience. That\u2019s why we are very excited.\nPhilip Winslow: Got it. Thanks very much. Appreciate it. Congrats and keep the good work.\nEric Yuan: By the way, Phil, you have a best [indiscernible] back on.\nPhilip Winslow: Thank you, Eric. Good try. Always be branded.\nOperator: Next question is from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: The regular room behind me. Can you hear me okay?\nEric Yuan: Yes.\nTyler Radke: Alright. Thanks so much. Good to see everybody again. I am curious how you are thinking about investing and compensating in the direct sales force this year. Obviously, you are talking about increased channel leverage, particularly with Zoom Phone. And I imagine renewals are going to be a pretty important topic as well for you in FY \u201822. So maybe just help me understand how fast do you expect to grow your direct sales force and if you are changing kind of the way that you are compensating them in terms of the mix of new versus renewals? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, the two areas of significant events what we are really focused on for FY \u201822 are exactly as you highlight. It\u2019s quota-carrying reps in our sales organization and it\u2019s engineers. And in both areas when we looked at the FY \u201822 plan, we looked at in terms of what\u2019s available in terms of capacity and the organization to absorb that as well as markets that are available. So you could just expect continued significant growth in the AEs in the sales organization. And then in terms of compensation, we didn\u2019t have significant change to our comp plan, but you did pick on key on one of the key points, which is renewals and retention. And historically, we have not compensated for that. So we did add a bonus component to the plan for this year to help align the reps\u2019 interest along with Zoom\u2019s as well.\nTyler Radke: Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question is from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey, Eric, Kelly, Tom. Thanks for taking my questions. It\u2019s great to see continued strong momentum and then heading into next year. I wanted to ask about maybe potential areas for expansion. You have obviously had some really great success with Zoom Phone and I appreciate that in the disclosures here. As you think about becoming a broader enterprise collaboration and communication platform, where are some other adjacencies that you think you can get into? I know you have hinted at these in the past. And philosophically, how do you think about the build versus buy, especially just given the amount of capital you have available on the balance sheet? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Yes, sure. Rishi, that\u2019s a great question. So when we started we were later looking on one thing this video conferencing app, right? But however over the past several years looking at the date, I think because of popularity of the video conferencing, a lot of people that are using Zoom during the pandemic crisis is using Zoom for videoconferencing as a company. That\u2019s the case, right? Look at Zoom video conferencing, look at Zoom Phone, look at Zoom Rooms, looking at built-in chat, and you look at also webinar, I think a huge opportunity. Almost each area item we see top down. Also look at the brand-new opportunities you look at on Zoom, I mentioned earlier, but another thing is about our ZoomX ecosystem. It\u2019s actually, Rishi, you and I, we are going to talk over Zoom, not because we have a business communication in all discussion, but also more like [indiscernible] we have that entire ecosystem. That\u2019s the reason why and we talk about how to transform our business from a [indiscernible] company to a platform company. With that in mind, I think lot of opportunity UC platform, remote work platform, and also the consumer prosumer platform. I think for sure, we cannot [indiscernible] right. We have got to be very careful, right, what we should build by ourselves what kind of product new categories we should partner or maybe go through the acquisition. That\u2019s why I like otherwise. But overall, I think to become a part of our company will open up a great opportunity for us. We are not only a videoconferencing company anymore.\nRishi Jaluria: Great, thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Zane Chrane with Bernstein.\nZane Chrane: Hi, congrats on another great quarter, team. I just want to dig in on the on Zoom offering. It seems like a really great way to improve the conversion rate of kind of prosumers and knowledge workers at the lower end of the market. Can you give us a sense of how much that\u2019s improving the paid conversion rate for free users to paid, maybe among consumers or independent contractors, freelancers, things like that? Is it a 10% increase? Is it double? And then secondly, on the gross margins for Zoom Phone, I know it\u2019s still subscale. But how should we think about the non-GAAP gross margin for that relative to videoconferencing commercing kind of in a steady state long-term? I know it\u2019s a lot less compute-intensive, so I\u2019m curious if that could potentially have higher margins. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yes, then I can address the first part. Kelly will address the second part of your question. And I hope I have a good answer for your question. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t because it\u2019s too early to tell, and we\u2019re still in the beta, right? We\u2019re trying to make sure the product experience is really solid before we announce the GA. But now it\u2019s beta right? You still can go on Zoom to register class to learn a cooking class, learn something that what kind of basic features are available. But again I think it\u2019s not a fully ready yet. I think we are obviously very optimistic down the road. Not only do we have a new \u2013 the revenue stream, not only do we have our customer more, but also look at the 3 users of online subscribers, right? We have one more opportunity. Either learn something or hold on Zoom event, more like a Uber right? I have a car at a time I have become a Uber driver. That\u2019s our strategy. But again, story is too early to tell. I do not have a very solid answer about that yet, yes.\nZane Chrane: Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And we are very optimistic. So thanks for the update.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: And Zane, sorry, did you ask about the gross margins for Zoom Phone or on Zoom?\nZane Chrane: Zoom Phone, it was a separate question a little bit. I\u2019m curious, since it\u2019s less compute-intensive if that could maybe have higher margins, especially since you don\u2019t have a free offering for that, like the video conferencing?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Pre-pandemic where \u2013 when we looked at this Zoom Phones, margins were actually slightly under the gross margin for Meetings due to the cost for the carriers on either end. So the goal though, is as we continue to grow, is to have leverage to be able to invest. And of course to see efficiencies across the overall platform that eventually those gross margins converge. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting to see right now, given the gross margin being impacted on Meetings by the free usage, Zoom Phone gross margin is probably actually even higher than Meetings right now.\nZane Chrane: Great. Very helpful. Thank you. Congrats, team.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Zane.\nOperator: The next question is from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thank you so much and so nice to see everybody. Eric, Kelly and Tom wonderful, great Q4, great year, we\u2019re all grateful. Kelly, my question is for you just around the seasonality of the business. Last year was so unusual. How are you thinking about modeling this year from a new business perspective, thinking about seasonality? And I know you caveated your guidance relative to the uncertainty of COVID. But what\u2019s the embedded assumption? Even though I totally appreciate that economies reopening doesn\u2019t mean that people stop using Zoom.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. I think first of all, you have to think about our business in terms of online and direct as they both have become very significant businesses. And there is a little bit of different behavior to the two of them. In the direct business, we expect to move back to a more normalized seasonality, if you will, as growing through the year, especially with enterprise buyers, to be a little more back-end loaded in each of the quarters as well as back-end loaded in terms of the year, especially as we\u2019re continuing to add capacity in our sales organization and having those reps ramp throughout the year as well. From online perspective, that is the one that is I think a little more uncertain, dependent upon the timing of people potentially returning to work as well as this integration with on Zoom and what we have modeled is we believe to be conservative in terms of an acceleration in churn rates. We\u2019re doing everything we can though, of course to retain those consumers and help them see the value in Zoom so that we don\u2019t see that as we move through the year.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much for taking the question.\nEric Yuan: Brad, thank you very much for wearing Zoom on top your head. I truly appreciate that.\nBrad Zelnick: Proudly, proudly. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Bhavan Suri with William Blair.\nBhavan Suri: Hey, everyone. Thanks and let me echo my congrats, a really great job. I want to chat a little bit about one specific competitor. It\u2019s our friends at Microsoft. And I\u2019d love to understand in a little more depth how that\u2019s playing out. Not today because obviously the results speak for themselves, but they are ostensibly giving a wafer free. And we know E5 is not free. Upgrading to E5 costs. But they have a lot of power in the mid-market and the enterprise. And I guess how do you feel about what they are doing? Is that a sense that at some point, maybe when you go back to work, it\u2019s good enough? Like how are you and the sales team sort of working around this issue of teams ostensively giving wafer free? That\u2019s kind of what I\u2019m getting at, specific to them, given sort of their scale and their power and their platform and they bundle it, etcetera. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yes. So I can start. Kelly, feel free to chime in. I think first of all, that is a real question. However, I\u2019d like to take a step back. I think we share I think the journey of Microsoft themselves. Because I think today Microsoft is very different. Since Satya took over the CEO job several years ago, I think Microsoft I think they are open-minded, right? Satya\u2019s a great CEO in the world, really on the market, but quite often when we talk of integration [indiscernible], they would like to work together with us. So willing to collaborate, right, that\u2019s very important. Like 10 years ago, if sometimes I think [indiscernible] concern. Today, that\u2019s not the case on Microsoft\u2019s perspective, right. I give the CEO, Microsoft CEO Satya, a great a deal of credit. That\u2019s the one who you look at from an end user perspective, expect you look at today\u2019s workforce. Almost over one-third are millennials. For one, they would like to use the best of breed service. If you give them something they do not like, they say, no, I\u2019d like to pay it with my own credit card. So the best of breed service will win, for sure. And also if you look at it even from a CIO or IT perspective, they would like to bet on good vendors, right? If you\u2019re stuck with one vendor for everything, guess what, what if there is outage? What if in the future, innovation speed slows down? That\u2019s why I\u2019m talking with the enterprise customers. They like to deploy the best of breed service. Like Zoom is video and voice is much better, right? That\u2019s why the core exists the strategy very well. Last but not least, you look at the Okta report. Probably that\u2019s the most important report for any IT professionals, right. You look at Okta report. Zoom is for number one videoconferencing app, right. And in terms of the position in terms of \u2013 based on a number of the customers, Zoom apps ranks number five. However, there is one metric that\u2019s very interesting. If you look at Okta\u2019s Microsoft Office 365, the deployment of the customers, those people use Zoom. Those use Zoom as well. That proves one thing. Customer, they would like to bet on good solutions because we can coexist very well. Again, this market size is much bigger than anyone can emerge in. That\u2019s why I think that a coexisting strategy works well. And we look at everything from a customer perspective. That\u2019s a long answer. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s answered to your question, Bhav, but that\u2019s based on our observation, yes.\nBhavan Suri: Yes. That\u2019s a great answer. I appreciate the color and the candor. Thank you all.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Richard Valera with Needham.\nRichard Valera: Thank you. And let me add my congratulations to a really great year and fourth quarter. So question on the education vertical, which has gotten a lot of sort of attention, and your thoughts on the trajectory of that business for you, you could maybe argue that there is a headwind if maybe decreased usage as folks go back to in-person school. But you guys have \u2013 I think it\u2019s 125,000 K-12 customers that are free now, but presumably at some point will be paying. And so I just wanted to check about how you\u2019re thinking about that revenue trajectory and the potential to monetize them? And if the July 31 date on your website is sort of the date that you\u2019re going to turn off free or is that sort of just a placeholder for now?\nKelly Steckelberg: In terms of the future and the opportunity ahead for education, as you noted, we have 125,000 K-12 domains that are using the product and have really become believers in Zoom. And what we expect is that as we look forward to students being able to return to campuses in person, that there is even a hybrid approach in education. We always joke, right, that students are going to hate us because there is no such thing as a snow day any longer. And imagine the benefit that has \u2013 the parents have also received from being able to attend PTA meetings from home, to be able to do parent-teacher conferences. So there are many, many use cases that extend beyond just the students being in the classroom, that we foresee these domains wanting to continue to work with us on. And in terms of the date that\u2019s on the website, I \u2013 as always, I believe that Zoom will do whatever the right thing is as we continue to assess how the pandemic could \u2013 progresses. The goal of that was really to minimize the disruption in learning, and we remain committed to that.\nRichard Valera: Great, thanks. Thanks very much, Kelly.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan MacWilliams with Stephens.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks for taking the questions. Can you talk about enterprise Zoom Meeting purchasing that you saw in the quarter? Like did enterprise customers increasingly go wall to wall and consolidate pockets of Zoom usage and business silos? And then separately, with the improving Zoom Phone momentum that you\u2019re seeing, do you see attach rates for contact center increase alongside that? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: In terms of \u2013 you saw the significant growth in the customers with greater than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue. And that, I think, is an indicator of all of those enterprise customers that we\u2019ve seen purchase this year, continuing to roll out and expand. In terms of wall to wall, we continue to see customers that are adding in terms of number of seats as well as buying broader. So I think it\u2019s a combination of both. And then in terms of contact center within Zoom Phone, Eric, do you want to?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Sure, sure, yes. I think in terms of a contact center, and I think for now, I think our strategy to work together with other contact center solutions like Five9, Genesys, InContact, Talkdesk and others, I think working very well, because customer, they talk about how do you seamlessly integrated others. Take Five9 for example, and good partner, Rob and I, we share the same vision, how to further improve their product experience. I love that. I think to have a much better seamless integration, that\u2019s the right approach and truly deliver happiness to our mutual customers.\nOperator: Our next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hey, guys. Congrats on excellent year. Really appreciate what you have done. Well, it was an impressive enterprise addition this quarter. Just trying to understand how much of these additions came from moving commerce customers up from Phone or \u2013 Phone within that commercial Meeting installed base. For new customer wins versus other items differentiate? Thanks. \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, it\u2019s really a combination of all of the above. So we continue to see customers that bought earlier this year deploying and rolling out and adding to their services. You heard some of the great wins that we talked about specifically on the call, as well as continued up-sells in terms of just expansion in terms of Meetings and continuing to make sure that their employees are being as efficient as possible. So it\u2019s not something specifically that we break out. I can just tell you that it\u2019s a combination of all of the above.\nJames Fish: Got it. Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Matthew VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I guess I wanted to dig a little deeper not just on the contact center side. But as customer experience really becomes a greater focus for larger enterprises, just what the opportunity is to embed Zoom from a partnership perspective, either in other software platforms or just kind of in company websites, things of that nature, to help facilitate a more interactive approach with customers and sort of how you can better monetize that in the long run?\nEric Yuan: Yes, Matt, that\u2019s a great question. That\u2019s overall our platform play. So today, in addition to having the APIs and SDKs to give the third-party companies and partners [indiscernible] vertical apps like online education, telemedicine apps via our platform SDK, we also introduced the Zoom Apps. I think \u2013 I think that\u2019s our future. Because the reason why some not only build for the business indications, but also offer our people-centric interface. You and I kind of use Zoom and also have a window, right. You are not putting games together. You approve my expense report of the integration with the service [indiscernible] sales force and all kinds of applications, not only for business apps, but also for consumer assets. Well, today, if you look at our marketplace, we already have over 1,000 apps by published in marketplace. So, we are going to double down on our Zoom App ecosystem, essentially, that\u2019s the future for our platform play and down the road, let\u2019s say, you have a lot of new applications or existing integrations. You have more in many ways to monetize down the road. The goal is to offer a people-centric Zoom interface for other applications to be integrated into Zoom.\nMatthew VanVliet: Great. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: The next question is from Imtiaz Koujalgi with Guggenheim. It looks like he has audio only.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Hey, guys. Can you hear me?\nEric Yuan: Yes.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Hi, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I have a question for Eric or Kelly on Zoom Phone Attach versus Zoom Meetings. So let\u2019s say a customer has both Zoom Meetings and Zoom Phone. I am assuming that any user who would have a Zoom Phone license versus Zoom Meetings, then only the host needs Zoom Meetings. Is there like a rule of thumb or what you are seeing in the customer base now in terms of what the vision of Zoom Meeting licenses to Zoom Phones is and what that potentially can be going forward?\nKelly Steckelberg: Generally, what we see is that your point is that not everybody needs a Zoom Meetings license, because only the host needs them. What we see from most organizations is they actually buy Zoom Meeting licenses for all of their employees as they want them to be as efficient as possible and then they buy a corresponding number of Zoom Phone seats as well. So typically, when a company is doing \u2013 our customers are doing a full deployment, it\u2019s a 1:1 ratio of Zoom Meetings to Zoom Phone.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Are there cases where customers end up buying more or less is it different by different vertical or customer size or is it typically \u2013 it is usually 1 to 1?\nKelly Steckelberg: It depends on the stage of where our company is in terms of its rollout and its deployment as they often start with Meetings and then add Zoom Phone and they may take some time to roll it out depending on its market, geographic location. The case for example that I do remember where there were more Zoom Phone licenses bought than Zoom Meeting, it was the case of a retailer that had Zoom Meetings and Zoom Phone in their corporate headquarters, but for example, they wanted to deploy Zoom Phone into their retail locations in the malls. And so there wasn\u2019t really a need for Zoom Meetings in the mall, but Zoom Phone was a really great fit for them. So, that\u2019s really the only case that I remember specifically where there were more Zoom Phone licensees sold than Zoom Meeting licenses.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Got it. Very, very helpful color. Thank you very much, Kelly.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Imtiaz.\nOperator: The next question is from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Hey, thanks for taking my question. Eric, I just wanted to ask on the product side, last year, I think more focus you had on security and are you looking at this year and your product team, what are you more excited about? Where you are more focused on?\nEric Yuan: I think first of all, security and privacy is always very important. Last year, I think Zoom has become a much stronger company, because we embraced a lot of consumers, right to serve consumers in terms of private security is very different compared to what we did before, but we did learn a lot. We really attributed on the team size, lot of the consulting and the third-party companies. And I think today, look at some Zoom privacy and security policy and the practice is totally different now, right. We have high confidence, but however, we are not going to say, it\u2019s done. No, this is ongoing effort. Privacy and security is a part of our company. Having said that, we also need to continue innovating, right. That\u2019s why how to transform our business to become a platform company at the same time, any new service, new feature, that new process, make the private security always there, not only for business or government customers, but also what\u2019s more important in that are consumers as well, right. That\u2019s \u2013 I think that\u2019s why the future is bright, because not only do we have new opportunities, but also the privacy and security story is much better than before.\nSiti Panigrahi: Okay, thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. And our last question will be from Tom Roderick with Stifel.\nTom Roderick: Great. Well, hi, Eric. Hi, Kelly. Hi, Tom. Great to see you all. Congratulations on a fantastic finish to what was a crazy year, but a fantastic one for you all. As we are going on almost a year now of sitting in our home offices and our bosses are telling us in a variety of ways that we are probably not going back to the old normal whether it\u2019s this year or next year or at all. I am curious for your thoughts on how you think about the way the world has changed and the way that you run Zoom, whether that\u2019s more remote offices, R&D specialists in different parts of the world? Is the cost structure sort of permanently changed for your vision of the world, because it seems like for the rest of us, it is changing in that way. I would love to hear your thoughts on that?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Kelly, please.\nKelly Steckelberg: Sure. So, I think the amazing thing that\u2019s happened during this pandemic it has opened us up to be able to hire talent wherever. We have really taken advantage of the opportunity, engineers, for example, which are highly competitive that we are now looking to hire the best talent from anywhere in the globe almost and really focused on especially in the U.S., diversifying outside of San Jose, which has been a great win for us. In terms of long-term growth \u2013 sorry, expense impact, we have not modeled in this year, at least for FY \u201822 expenses associated with return to work as we continue to evaluate when it feels safe to support our employees and moving back into the office and coming back together in person. And once we have more clarity around that, of course we will assess how that impacts our operating margins.\nOperator: That\u2019s great. I will turn it back to you. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Alright. Well, thank you so much for joining us today. We really appreciate it. Look forward to FY \u201822.\nTom McCallum: Thank you everybody.\nEric Yuan: Thank you all.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, guys.",

            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and hello, everybody. As Eric mentioned, FY 2021 was a pivotal year for us. While the pandemic stress tested our operations, it also accelerated our growth opportunities. According to Okta's 2021 Business Network Report, which relies upon data from Okta's customers, Zoom was by far the preferred enterprise video conferencing app ranked among the most popular workplace apps overall. And we're the top app by number of customers and active unique users. In addition, analyst firm Frost & Sullivan recently recognized Zoom with its 2020 Company of the Year award, honoring Zoom's dedication to providing customers with innovative solutions that drive growth and deliver new capabilities. Thank you to our amazing customers who made these accolades possible. Bolstering the growth of our product portfolio is Zoom Phone, which has grown incredibly and turned two last quarter. We believe the opportunity ahead is significant as the TAM for telephony is forecasted to grow to $23 billion by 2024. We have seen wins from legacy on-prem providers as well as other cloud PBX vendors. Here are a few milestones to mark the anniversary. Illustrating the ability of Zoom Phone to meet the needs for large-scale enterprise rollouts, Zoom Phone finished FY \u201821 with 18 customers, each with over 10,000 paid seats. We closed FY \u201821 with approximately 10,700 Zoom Phone customers with more than 10 employees, up 269% year-over-year. We continued to drive broad adoption across industries and customer sizes. We are 60% within the mass market and 40% from the up market. With our base of approximately 467,000 customers with more than 10 employees and our growing channel presence, Zoom Phone is in a strong position as customers look to modernize their phone systems to an integrated communications platform. Now getting into the results, let me start with a few of the financial highlights and then for the full year. I will review our financial results for Q4 and finally, our outlook for Q1 and the full year of FY \u201822. Revenue grew 326% to $2.7 billion as we exited the fiscal year at an annualized run rate of $3.5 billion. We grew non-GAAP operating margin to 37.1%, up from 14.2% in FY \u201820. Free cash flow grew by over 12x to $1.4 billion for the full year. In Q4, total revenue grew 369% year-over-year to $882 million. This top line result exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $811 million due to strong sales and marketing execution in online, direct and channel businesses as well as lower-than-expected churn. The demand was widespread across products, industry verticals, geographies, new logos and customer cohorts. The year-over-year growth in revenue for the quarter was mainly driven by the sharp increase in new customers this year, which accounted for approximately 80% of the incremental revenue, up from 59% in Q4 of last year. We continue to add customers of all sizes and across industries that we anticipate will provide future up-sell opportunities. Let's take a look at the key customer metrics for the quarter. We continue to see expansion in the up market as we ended the quarter with 1,644 customers generating more than $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue, up 156% year-over-year and 28% quarter-over-quarter. This is an increase of 355 customers sequentially, the highest number of quarterly net adds for this segment. We made great progress in the up market and still see a lot of opportunity ahead. For example, we grew the number of Global 2000 customers generating at least $100,000 of ARR by more than 100% this year, but that still accounts for only 14% of the total population. We exited the quarter with approximately 467,000 customers with more than 10 employees, adding approximately 33,000 customers during the quarter and 385,000 customers during the year. In Q4, customers with more than 10 employees represented approximately 63% of revenue. We also continued to benefit from significant growth in our segment of customers with 10 or fewer employees. In Q4, customers with 10 or fewer employees represented approximately 37% of revenue, up from 20% in Q4 last year and down modestly from 38% in Q3. Our net dollar expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees exceeded 130% for the 11th consecutive quarter, as existing customers acquired more Zoom Meeting licenses, Rooms, webinars and Zoom Phone products. We value their trust in us to build their unified communications on Zoom. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Our Americas revenue grew over 292% year-over-year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew 687% year-over-year to be 33% of revenue, up from 20% a year ago. In FY \u201822, we intend to make additional investments in international resources to further capitalize on the global opportunity. Now turning to profitability, the increase in demand and strong execution drove net income profitability from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock, and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter was 71.3% compared to 84.2% in Q4 last year and 68.2% in Q3. The year-over-year decline in our gross margin is partially due to the dramatic increase in free usage related to the pandemic, including our ongoing commitment to support approximately 125,000 K-12 domains as well as the higher utilization of public cloud services. The sequential improvement mainly relates to seasonal audio usage, which decreases during the holiday season. We would expect gross margins to remain around 70% as long as we continue to support free K-12 education. Research and development expense grew by 91% year-over-year to approximately $31 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense was approximately 3.5%, which is lower than in Q4 of FY \u201820 mainly due to the strong top line growth. Though we made strides in expanding our team, we remain committed to prioritizing R&D hiring and continuing to grow in order to drive further innovation, expansion and security on our platform. Sales and marketing expense grew by 90% year-over-year to $159 million. This reflects an additional $75 million over last year, primarily due to investments in hiring to drive future growth. Sales and marketing expense was approximately 18.1% of total revenue, a decrease from Q4 of FY \u201820 mainly due to strong top line growth. We plan to continue to invest in adding sales capacity and product marketing programs over the next several quarters, focused on capturing market share. G&A expense in the quarter grew by 291% to $78 million as we continued to scale our G&A functions and invest heavily in security and compliance headcount and professional services. G&A expense was approximately 8.8% of total revenue, a decrease from Q4 of FY \u201820. The revenue upside in the quarter carried through to the bottom line, with non-GAAP operating income of $361 million exceeding our guidance. This translates to a 40.9% non-GAAP operating margin for the fourth quarter, a large improvement from 20.4% in Q4 last year and steady improvement from 37.4% in Q3. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q4, was $1.22 on approximately 301 million non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.43 above the high end of our guidance and $1.07 higher than Q4 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue at the end of the period was $883 million, up 283% year-over-year from $231 million. Also, please note we have seen a shift in the mix of invoicing to approximately 50% of business being billed monthly, up from approximately 40% in the previous year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $1.8 billion, up 190% year-over-year from $604 million. The increase in RPO is consistent with the strong demand and execution in the quarter. We expect to recognize approximately 70% or $1.2 billion of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 62% or $375 million in Q4 of FY \u201820. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities excluding restricted cash. This balance includes approximately $2 billion from our follow-on public offering in January. We had exceptional operating cash flow in the quarter of $399 million, up from $37 million in Q4 last year. Free cash flow was $378 million, up from $27 million in Q4 last year. The increase is primarily attributable to strong billings and collections. Looking into FY \u201822, we expect to increase our capital expenditures related to the build-out of our data center infrastructure to support our growth outlook and drive additional efficiencies. Now turning to guidance, we are pleased to announce our outlook for FY \u201822 for both revenue and non-GAAP profitability. Although we remain optimistic on Zoom's outlook, please note the impact and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and people returning to in-person contact still remains largely unknown. Our outlook is based on our current assessment of the business environment. For the first quarter of FY \u201822, we expect revenue to be in the range of $900 million to $905 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $295 million to $300 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.95 to $0.97 based on approximately 307 million shares outstanding. Both Q1 and full year share count include the additional shares issued in our follow-on public offering. For the full year of FY \u201822, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.76 billion to $3.78 billion, which would represent approximately 42% to 43% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.13 billion to $1.15 billion, which would represent approximately 14% to 16% year-over-year growth. Our outlook for the non-GAAP earnings per share is $3.59 to $3.65 based on approximately 311 million shares outstanding. Before concluding, I am happy to highlight that today we announced the first group of grant recipients from our EdInnovation Awards program. This is part of our Zoom Care's philanthropic program under our ESG umbrella. We are excited to support their work, which includes promoting diversity from within the teaching profession, entrepreneurial and job training, assisting and inspiring youth in conflict-affected areas to join the digital economy and providing access to science-based approaches to reading education. We are proud to sponsor these critical and innovative education efforts around the world and support the next generation of talent. As we look forward to FY \u201822, Zoom is grateful to be a driving force, enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless and secure communications platform. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community and our investors. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of our meeting. Matt, please queue up our first question. So, Alex, we are really excited about the opportunity of Zoom Phone ahead. As you have heard, they performed very well this year. They were \u2013 the Zoom Phone was the fastest-growing product line quarter-over-quarter in Q4 and we expect to see strong growth as we look towards FY 2022. As you remember, our strategy is to sell into our existing install base. So based on the customers that we have today, we see tremendous opportunity for further up-sells with Zoom Phone. And then high level in terms of the churn rates, we have seen churn like \u2013 churn rates stabilize in the back half of FY 2021. And we do though \u2013 they are certainly elevated from pre-pandemic period and we have assumed that to continue as we move through FY 2022 and the uncertainty around when people will be able to start to safely move around the world again. In terms of what we are going to do with that $4.2 billion, so we, as you said, we are certainly investing in building out more data center infrastructure. And we are constantly looking for opportunities for other interesting companies, potentially M&A activity, that could add either to our talent or our technology. It's just as I'm sure all of you know, Eric, has a very high bar for both. And so we just haven't quite found the right match yet, but we keep looking. Colin leads our corporate dev team, and his team are just constantly looking and seeing what's out there. It looks interesting. So we will see. We are certainly open to it. It's just finding the right match for us. Hi. I think the great news, Phil, is that it's actually spread across all industries. You saw those names that we talked about, right. We had a university. We had an entertainment organization and a technology company. And that's been \u2013 I think the success of Zoom Phone from the very beginning is it's really appealed well to small and large enterprises alike and across all industries. And the reason that we win right is based on, as Eric mentioned, the trust that they already have in as well as the usability and the total cost of ownership, which plays well across all industries. So, the two areas of significant events what we are really focused on for FY \u201822 are exactly as you highlight. It's quota-carrying reps in our sales organization and it's engineers. And in both areas when we looked at the FY \u201822 plan, we looked at in terms of what's available in terms of capacity and the organization to absorb that as well as markets that are available. So you could just expect continued significant growth in the AEs in the sales organization. And then in terms of compensation, we didn't have significant change to our comp plan, but you did pick on key on one of the key points, which is renewals and retention. And historically, we have not compensated for that. So we did add a bonus component to the plan for this year to help align the reps' interest along with Zoom's as well. And Zane, sorry, did you ask about the gross margins for Zoom Phone or on Zoom? Yes. Pre-pandemic where \u2013 when we looked at this Zoom Phones, margins were actually slightly under the gross margin for Meetings due to the cost for the carriers on either end. So the goal though, is as we continue to grow, is to have leverage to be able to invest. And of course to see efficiencies across the overall platform that eventually those gross margins converge. And that's what we're expecting to see right now, given the gross margin being impacted on Meetings by the free usage, Zoom Phone gross margin is probably actually even higher than Meetings right now. Yes. I think first of all, you have to think about our business in terms of online and direct as they both have become very significant businesses. And there is a little bit of different behavior to the two of them. In the direct business, we expect to move back to a more normalized seasonality, if you will, as growing through the year, especially with enterprise buyers, to be a little more back-end loaded in each of the quarters as well as back-end loaded in terms of the year, especially as we're continuing to add capacity in our sales organization and having those reps ramp throughout the year as well. From online perspective, that is the one that is I think a little more uncertain, dependent upon the timing of people potentially returning to work as well as this integration with on Zoom and what we have modeled is we believe to be conservative in terms of an acceleration in churn rates. We're doing everything we can though, of course to retain those consumers and help them see the value in Zoom so that we don't see that as we move through the year. In terms of the future and the opportunity ahead for education, as you noted, we have 125,000 K-12 domains that are using the product and have really become believers in Zoom. And what we expect is that as we look forward to students being able to return to campuses in person, that there is even a hybrid approach in education. We always joke, right, that students are going to hate us because there is no such thing as a snow day any longer. And imagine the benefit that has \u2013 the parents have also received from being able to attend PTA meetings from home, to be able to do parent-teacher conferences. So there are many, many use cases that extend beyond just the students being in the classroom, that we foresee these domains wanting to continue to work with us on. And in terms of the date that's on the website, I \u2013 as always, I believe that Zoom will do whatever the right thing is as we continue to assess how the pandemic could \u2013 progresses. The goal of that was really to minimize the disruption in learning, and we remain committed to that. In terms of \u2013 you saw the significant growth in the customers with greater than $100,000 of trailing 12 months revenue. And that, I think, is an indicator of all of those enterprise customers that we've seen purchase this year, continuing to roll out and expand. In terms of wall to wall, we continue to see customers that are adding in terms of number of seats as well as buying broader. So I think it's a combination of both. And then in terms of contact center within Zoom Phone, Eric, do you want to? Yes. So, it's really a combination of all of the above. So we continue to see customers that bought earlier this year deploying and rolling out and adding to their services. You heard some of the great wins that we talked about specifically on the call, as well as continued up-sells in terms of just expansion in terms of Meetings and continuing to make sure that their employees are being as efficient as possible. So it's not something specifically that we break out. I can just tell you that it's a combination of all of the above. Hi. Generally, what we see is that your point is that not everybody needs a Zoom Meetings license, because only the host needs them. What we see from most organizations is they actually buy Zoom Meeting licenses for all of their employees as they want them to be as efficient as possible and then they buy a corresponding number of Zoom Phone seats as well. So typically, when a company is doing \u2013 our customers are doing a full deployment, it's a 1:1 ratio of Zoom Meetings to Zoom Phone. It depends on the stage of where our company is in terms of its rollout and its deployment as they often start with Meetings and then add Zoom Phone and they may take some time to roll it out depending on its market, geographic location. The case for example that I do remember where there were more Zoom Phone licenses bought than Zoom Meeting, it was the case of a retailer that had Zoom Meetings and Zoom Phone in their corporate headquarters, but for example, they wanted to deploy Zoom Phone into their retail locations in the malls. And so there wasn't really a need for Zoom Meetings in the mall, but Zoom Phone was a really great fit for them. So, that's really the only case that I remember specifically where there were more Zoom Phone licensees sold than Zoom Meeting licenses. Sure. So, I think the amazing thing that's happened during this pandemic it has opened us up to be able to hire talent wherever. We have really taken advantage of the opportunity, engineers, for example, which are highly competitive that we are now looking to hire the best talent from anywhere in the globe almost and really focused on especially in the U.S., diversifying outside of San Jose, which has been a great win for us. In terms of long-term growth \u2013 sorry, expense impact, we have not modeled in this year, at least for FY \u201822 expenses associated with return to work as we continue to evaluate when it feels safe to support our employees and moving back into the office and coming back together in person. And once we have more clarity around that, of course we will assess how that impacts our operating margins. Alright. Well, thank you so much for joining us today. We really appreciate it. Look forward to FY \u201822."

Fiscal year 2021 was truly a pivotal year for Zoom characterized by achieving unprecedented success and overcoming tremendous challenges. My heartfelt appreciation goes out to our approximately 4,400 employees for their incredible energy, perseverance and dedication. Their focus on delivering happiness and building trust enabled us to become a household name and one of the most popular apps of the year. We are so grateful to our customers, partners, investors and the entire community for trusting us during these COVID times; and are humbled to see workers, students and families log to our platform and use it in increasingly in innovative ways to connect, contribute and collaborate. As the world emerges from the pandemic, our work has only begun. The future is here with the rise of remote and work-from-anywhere trends. We recognize this new reality and are helping to empower our own employees and those of our customers to work and thrive in a distributed manner. As companies begin their safe return to the office and reimagine their working models, Zoom is here to help, leading the transformation with an extensive and growing portfolio of offerings and product features. For example, Zoom Room enhancement connected seamlessly with Zoom Meetings enabling features like Virtual Reception, Smart Gallery and more, to provide a secure, inclusive and empowering work-from-anywhere experience. Our evolution from a leading video communications app into a video communications platform will strengthen our position in the new normal by providing customers with a growing set of innovative and integrated collaboration and productivity tools. We are very energized to help lead the evolution to enable the future of work that allows greater flexibility for both in-person and virtual connections, a future that we believe will be better for the planet, productivity and employee happiness. Next, as part of Zoom Phone's second anniversary, I'd like to highlight some exciting deals where we harness the power of the channel to secure large enterprise rollouts of Zoom Phone. We are optimistic about the growth in our channel partners, including master agents who work as a liaison between customers and the telecommunications world. These channel partners are force multipliers and have proven to be strong advocates for us. So, let me share a few happy customers' stories. We are grateful to have the University of Southern California as a longstanding Zoom Meetings and a new Zoom Phone customer. Our commitment to USC and broad higher education was rewarded when the university and their master agent short-listed us in an extensive vendor review to modernize their phone systems. After a six months evaluation of the UCaaS vendors, USC chose to deploy 21,000 Zoom Phone seats. We are so thankful that USC put their trust in Zoom to deliver an increasingly comprehensive and integrated set of communications services. Another highlight this quarter was the expansion with Equinix, the world's digital infrastructure company, enabling digital leaders to harness a platform to bring it together and interconnect the foundational infrastructure that powers their success. Equinix has been a Zoom customer for several years and use Zoom Meetings and Zoom Rooms for its global employees to communicate and collaborate. We recently expanded their partnership by adding Zoom Phones with over 10,000 seats. On top of being seamlessly integrated with Zoom Meetings and Rooms, they chose Zoom Phone for our global footprint, our ability to serve Equinix data centers with zero-touch provisioning and our advanced features over other UCaaS offerings. Let me also welcome a direct sales win. We are very happy to announce that Universal Music Group, the world's leading musical company, is adopting Zoom Phone for its global workforce. UMG was looking to replace and consolidate legacy on-prem technologies with flexible, cloud PBX solutions. As an existing Zoom Meetings and Azure customers, UMG was drawn to the integrated nature of the Zoom Phone product. They will be using Zoom United, which will provide their global users with a one touch experience of video, chat and voice. Thank you, UMG. These stories are not exceptions. Enterprise customers choose to replace their legacy phone system because of their positive experiences with our high-quality products that are very easy use and are well integrated. With the value of our rapid innovation circles and ability to scale for large and global deployments, they also look to us to partner with them to deliver a unified communication solution that will make their users happy and productive. Thank you, Equinix, USC, UMG and our supportive channel partners. I love you all. With that, let me turn things over to Kelly. Yes. So, that's a great question. First of all, if you look at why our customers, they choose Zoom or other cloud-based PBX solutions. First of all, you look at our existing customers, we already got their trust. They really enjoyed other very high-quality products, because of that, they would like to test the Zoom. After they have tested Zoom, they realize Zoom Phone. After they test that realize it's feature-rich, very reliable, very easy to use, modern architecture, integrated very well with our meetings, Zoom Rooms and other product lines. So as I said, from current perspective, we have high confidence. From a distribution perspective, not only did they drive the other growth from our delivery team and you see like the U.S. account, right, driven by Master Agent. I think we are doubling on that channel partners, especially look at the history of the Zoom cloud-based PBX growth, primarily driven by the channel partners. I think our strategy to focus on building a greater partnership with channel partners such as Master Agent, are really paying off. I think we are working to double down on that. Thank you. Yes. Maybe, Matt, I can address the first part of your question. You are absolutely right it's only 14% of Global 2K customers. So, the reason why you look at our history, the way for us to grow our revenue, our user base is from the bottom up from 1 user, 2 user; one department to multiple department and we talk to the CIO, right? And we are doing something similar. That's why there is huge opportunity ahead of us. Because last year, I think that if you have talked with the enterprise customers, if you do not have a very strong brand, normally they even do not want to talk with you, right? Because last year I think Zoom has become a household brand, I think we have more and more opportunities in the pipeline and people like to talk with us now, not only from bottom-up, but also from the top down as well. Having said that, I think the rest of the Global 2K customer is basically look at international and the growth opportunity. I think the future is bright as long as we keep focusing on execution. By the way, Matt, if any of you have any great advice in how to do that, no, we will love all those advice. Thank you. Yes. So first of all, if you look at our international penetration, 42 countries you look at our Zoom Phone and the service. I think look at our Phone, the growth, 40% are from the upper market, 60% are from SMB market. If you talk about the upper market, I think more and more opportunities will come from international customers. The reason why we started, we lead the folks on North American market since last calendar year. As we started rolling out to more and more international customers, I think the international penetration, I think will be the catalyst for our future Zoom Phone growth. Yes, Kelly, feel free to chime in. Actually in terms of Zoom, we launched [indiscernible] announced that at last October at a Zoom annual user conference, but now it's in the beta stage now, right. So \u2013 and based on our talk with those early adopters and also based on the progress, we think Zoom is not only designed for the knowledge workers, but more a consumer, right, to learn the [indiscernible] class. And also another part of on Zoom is about the overall biggest customer, enterprise customer online virtual event. This year at Zoomtopia, we will hold that event complete event on Zoom platform, essentially Zoom had two parts, consumer-driven on Zoom to allow workers to make a living to sell a yoga class, teaching anything online on our Zoom platform. And also we are beginning to expand our revenue platform to be our end-to-end corporate virtual event platform. That market also has huge growth opportunity. Thank you. Yes. Yes, Phil. Yes, first of all, we all want to go back to the office, right. We are stuck in our home for such a long time, so painful, but actually even if we all go back to the office, I think the product videoconferencing is well expected for the growth, but most importantly is customers who would like to consolidate it. Now, phone and video are the same thing, [indiscernible] why do they need to have another system? Why don't they deploy the hardware back to the phone? But essentially Zoom Phone already give you everything. I think in the past, also Zoom Phone is very well integrated with Zoom Meetings and Zoom Rooms, right. A lot of companies are talking about how to read into the office, especially focused on the conference room system. Recently our innovations, like a Virtual Reception, like Smart Gallery plus Zoom Phone, those two can really help us give customers unified collaboration and communication experience. That's why we are very excited. By the way, Phil, you have a best [indiscernible] back on. Yes. Yes, sure. Rishi, that's a great question. So when we started we were later looking on one thing this video conferencing app, right? But however over the past several years looking at the date, I think because of popularity of the video conferencing, a lot of people that are using Zoom during the pandemic crisis is using Zoom for videoconferencing as a company. That's the case, right? Look at Zoom video conferencing, look at Zoom Phone, look at Zoom Rooms, looking at built-in chat, and you look at also webinar, I think a huge opportunity. Almost each area item we see top down. Also look at the brand-new opportunities you look at on Zoom, I mentioned earlier, but another thing is about our ZoomX ecosystem. It's actually, Rishi, you and I, we are going to talk over Zoom, not because we have a business communication in all discussion, but also more like [indiscernible] we have that entire ecosystem. That's the reason why and we talk about how to transform our business from a [indiscernible] company to a platform company. With that in mind, I think lot of opportunity UC platform, remote work platform, and also the consumer prosumer platform. I think for sure, we cannot [indiscernible] right. We have got to be very careful, right, what we should build by ourselves what kind of product new categories we should partner or maybe go through the acquisition. That's why I like otherwise. But overall, I think to become a part of our company will open up a great opportunity for us. We are not only a videoconferencing company anymore. Thank you. Yes, then I can address the first part. Kelly will address the second part of your question. And I hope I have a good answer for your question. Unfortunately, I don't because it's too early to tell, and we're still in the beta, right? We're trying to make sure the product experience is really solid before we announce the GA. But now it's beta right? You still can go on Zoom to register class to learn a cooking class, learn something that what kind of basic features are available. But again I think it's not a fully ready yet. I think we are obviously very optimistic down the road. Not only do we have a new \u2013 the revenue stream, not only do we have our customer more, but also look at the 3 users of online subscribers, right? We have one more opportunity. Either learn something or hold on Zoom event, more like a Uber right? I have a car at a time I have become a Uber driver. That's our strategy. But again, story is too early to tell. I do not have a very solid answer about that yet, yes. Thank you. Thank you, Zane. Brad, thank you very much for wearing Zoom on top your head. I truly appreciate that. Thank you. Yes. So I can start. Kelly, feel free to chime in. I think first of all, that is a real question. However, I'd like to take a step back. I think we share I think the journey of Microsoft themselves. Because I think today Microsoft is very different. Since Satya took over the CEO job several years ago, I think Microsoft I think they are open-minded, right? Satya's a great CEO in the world, really on the market, but quite often when we talk of integration [indiscernible], they would like to work together with us. So willing to collaborate, right, that's very important. Like 10 years ago, if sometimes I think [indiscernible] concern. Today, that's not the case on Microsoft's perspective, right. I give the CEO, Microsoft CEO Satya, a great a deal of credit. That's the one who you look at from an end user perspective, expect you look at today's workforce. Almost over one-third are millennials. For one, they would like to use the best of breed service. If you give them something they do not like, they say, no, I'd like to pay it with my own credit card. So the best of breed service will win, for sure. And also if you look at it even from a CIO or IT perspective, they would like to bet on good vendors, right? If you're stuck with one vendor for everything, guess what, what if there is outage? What if in the future, innovation speed slows down? That's why I'm talking with the enterprise customers. They like to deploy the best of breed service. Like Zoom is video and voice is much better, right? That's why the core exists the strategy very well. Last but not least, you look at the Okta report. Probably that's the most important report for any IT professionals, right. You look at Okta report. Zoom is for number one videoconferencing app, right. And in terms of the position in terms of \u2013 based on a number of the customers, Zoom apps ranks number five. However, there is one metric that's very interesting. If you look at Okta's Microsoft Office 365, the deployment of the customers, those people use Zoom. Those use Zoom as well. That proves one thing. Customer, they would like to bet on good solutions because we can coexist very well. Again, this market size is much bigger than anyone can emerge in. That's why I think that a coexisting strategy works well. And we look at everything from a customer perspective. That's a long answer. I'm not sure it's answered to your question, Bhav, but that's based on our observation, yes. Thank you. Yes. Sure, sure, yes. I think in terms of a contact center, and I think for now, I think our strategy to work together with other contact center solutions like Five9, Genesys, InContact, Talkdesk and others, I think working very well, because customer, they talk about how do you seamlessly integrated others. Take Five9 for example, and good partner, Rob and I, we share the same vision, how to further improve their product experience. I love that. I think to have a much better seamless integration, that's the right approach and truly deliver happiness to our mutual customers. Yes, Matt, that's a great question. That's overall our platform play. So today, in addition to having the APIs and SDKs to give the third-party companies and partners [indiscernible] vertical apps like online education, telemedicine apps via our platform SDK, we also introduced the Zoom Apps. I think \u2013 I think that's our future. Because the reason why some not only build for the business indications, but also offer our people-centric interface. You and I kind of use Zoom and also have a window, right. You are not putting games together. You approve my expense report of the integration with the service [indiscernible] sales force and all kinds of applications, not only for business apps, but also for consumer assets. Well, today, if you look at our marketplace, we already have over 1,000 apps by published in marketplace. So, we are going to double down on our Zoom App ecosystem, essentially, that's the future for our platform play and down the road, let's say, you have a lot of new applications or existing integrations. You have more in many ways to monetize down the road. The goal is to offer a people-centric Zoom interface for other applications to be integrated into Zoom. Thank you, Matt. Yes. I think first of all, security and privacy is always very important. Last year, I think Zoom has become a much stronger company, because we embraced a lot of consumers, right to serve consumers in terms of private security is very different compared to what we did before, but we did learn a lot. We really attributed on the team size, lot of the consulting and the third-party companies. And I think today, look at some Zoom privacy and security policy and the practice is totally different now, right. We have high confidence, but however, we are not going to say, it's done. No, this is ongoing effort. Privacy and security is a part of our company. Having said that, we also need to continue innovating, right. That's why how to transform our business to become a platform company at the same time, any new service, new feature, that new process, make the private security always there, not only for business or government customers, but also what's more important in that are consumers as well, right. That's \u2013 I think that's why the future is bright, because not only do we have new opportunities, but also the privacy and security story is much better than before. Yes. Kelly, please. Thank you all."

And at this time, I'm going to hand the call over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Matt.

Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today\u2019s webinar. Now let\u2019s hear from Eric\nEric Yuan: Hello, I hope you are all doing well. I am so sorry that I can\u2019t join you all live today, but I had a personal conflict arise. As we are in the season of Thanksgiving in the U.S., I wanted to express my ongoing gratitude for the commitment of our Zoom employees and the support of our customers, partners and investors during these unprecedented times. You all truly inspire and motivate us every day. Now let me share with you a few recent business highlights. First, revenue grew 367% year-over-year in Q3. Second, with a strong sales execution, our customers with more than 10 employees grew 485% year-over-year. And we are very delighted that, just recently, Gartner Research has named Zoom a leader in the 2020 Magic Quadrant for Meeting Solutions, as well as a leader in the Magic Quadrant for Unified Communications as a Service. This is the first year Zoom has qualified for inclusion in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for UCaaS and in the sixth year of Meeting Solutions. We are also very thrilled to welcome Secretary Janet Napolitano to our Board of Directors. We also had exciting wins in the quarter where customers committed to multiple Zoom products to provide a high-quality experience for their users. First, I would like to welcome Peloton to the Zoom family. Peloton is a leading interactive fitness platform. In Q3, Peloton consolidated to one vendor, buying both Zoom Meetings and Zoom Rooms to provide a more feature-rich video communication service to their employees. We are very honored to have Peloton committed to a long-term engagement, where they will deploy services across all locations and employees. A global customer increasing their commitment with Zoom is Rakuten. Rakuten is a global leader in Internet services with 1.4 billion members around the world. Impressed by the simplicity in the Zoom technology, the ease of facilitating the service and the feature-rich application, Rakuten has committed to the full Zoom UCaaS deployment. They have grown to 42,000 meetings licenses, more than 1,000 Zoom Rooms and are currently deploying Zoom Phones across the globe. We also want to recognize the Israel Ministry of Education, which oversees public education institutions. The Ministry of Education has enabled about 200,000 teachers and 1.2 million students to use Zoom. The leadership at the Ministry has told me that, Zoom became the most popular app for video meetings in Israel\u2019s schools because of its simplicity, stability and many options for security and privacy. Thank you for their hard work to provide for children\u2019s educational needs during this crisis. And to all educators around the globe, you are all heroes. Thank you, Peloton. Thank you, Rakuten. Thank you, Israel Ministry of Education. I love you all. Also thank you as well to all other customers. Your trust and happiness energize the entire Zoom team. Now let me talk about my favorite event of the year, Zoomtopia. In October, we had over 155,000 unique viewers attend Zoomtopia, our premier customer and community event. This year\u2019s event was held virtually on Zoom technology. We also had over 140 customer speakers, ranging from Fortune 50 companies to small businesses, and across all verticals, sharing stories of how they have integrated Zoom into all aspects of their communication and collaboration. We showcased several customers who are not just conducting their business over Zoom, they are reimagining and delivering new business services over Zoom as well, including the new OnZoom platform. I\u2019m very proud of the Zoom team that delivered this successful event to our user community and at the size and scope that is truly incredible for virtual events. We were also able to demonstrate to the world that you can do this too with Zoom.  In summary, Zoom performed well for our customers and communities during the third quarter. I want to thank our over 3,800 employees who continue to scale our business and truly deliver happiness. With that, let me turn things over to Kelly, but first here is a look of what our new OnZoom platform has to offer. Thank you. [Audio-Visual Presentation]\nKelly Steckelberg: Hello, everybody. We\u2019re so glad you could join us today. In Q3, we continued to be inspired by the many creative ways our customers have been using Zoom to work anywhere, learn anywhere and connect anywhere. Let me start by reviewing our financial results for Q3, then discuss our increased outlook for Q4 and the full-year FY 2021. Total revenue grew 367% year-over-year to $777 million in Q3, achieving a $3 billion revenue run rate. This top line result exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $690 million due to strong sales and marketing execution in both our online and direct businesses, as well as lower-than-expected churn. For the quarter, the year-over-year growth in revenue was primarily due to subscriptions provided to new customers, which accounted for approximately 81% of the increase, while subscriptions provided to existing customers accounted for approximately 19% of the increase. This demand was broad-based across products, industry verticals, geographies and customer cohorts. Let\u2019s take a look at the key customer metrics for Q3. We continue to see expansion in the upmarket as we ended Q3 with 1,289 customers generating more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue, up 136% year-over-year. This is an increase of more than 300 customers over Q2, the highest number of adds we have had in a quarter. We exited the quarter with a total of approximately 433,700 customers with more than 10 employees. We added approximately 63,500 of these customers during Q3. Year-over-year, we added approximately 360,000 new customers with more than 10 employees, representing a 485% increase. In Q3, customers with more than 10 employees represented approximately 62% of revenue. We also continue to benefit from significant growth in our segment of customers with 10 or fewer employees, as small businesses and individuals adopted and maintained their Zoom licenses. In Q3, customers with 10 or fewer employees represented approximately 38% of revenue, up from 36% in Q2. Our net dollar expansion for customers with more than 10 employees was over 130% for the 10th consecutive quarter as existing customers continue to support and trust Zoom to be their video communications platform of choice. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Americas grew over 300% year-over-year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew 629% year-over-year and was consistent with Q2 at 31% of revenue. We plan to continue to invest in international expansion to capitalize on our brand awareness and the increased global opportunity. Now turning to profitability. The increase in demand and strong execution drove net income profitability from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 68.2%, compared to 82.9% in Q3 last year and 72.3% last quarter. The impact to our gross margin is partially due to the dramatic increase in usage related to the pandemic, as we are experiencing a higher percentage of free users, including those in over 125,000 K-12 educational institutions that went back to school in the fall. It is also due to the continued higher utilization of public cloud services.  We ended the quarter with an annualized run rate of 3.5 trillion meeting minutes, approximately 75% growth quarter-over-quarter. We are thrilled that a significant percentage of the usage was from both paid and free participants in the education sector, as millions of students and teachers returned to the classroom virtually. With the uncertainty of the longevity of the pandemic, it is unclear how long gross margins will be impacted as we remain committed to supporting the global community. Consequently, we expect gross margins to be consistent with Q3 into the next fiscal year before starting to improve towards our long-term target margin. R&D expense in Q3 was approximately $25 million, up 80% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense was approximately 3%, which was lower than Q3 last year mainly due to the strong top line growth. We are committed to prioritize R&D hiring to drive further innovation, expansion and security into our platform. Sales and marketing expense for Q3 was $141 million. This reflects an increase of 71% or $59 million over last year primarily due to investments to drive future growth. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expense was approximately 18%, a decrease from Q3 last year mainly due to strong top line growth and marketing efficiencies from the virtual production of Zoomtopia. We plan to continue to invest in adding sales capacity and marketing programs over the next several quarters to capture market share and to deliver on our growth opportunities. G&A expense in Q3 was $73 million, up 257% on a year-over-year basis as we continued to scale our G&A functions to support a company of our size. As a percentage of total revenue, G&A expense was approximately 9%, a decrease from Q3 last year. The revenue upside in the quarter carried over to the bottom line, with non-GAAP operating income of $291 million exceeding our guidance. This translates to a 37.4% non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter. This is an increase compared to Q3 last year\u2019s result of 12.8%, and a decrease from Q2 FY21\u2019s margin of 41.7%. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q3 was $0.99, on approximately 299 million of non-GAAP, weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.25 more than the high end of our guidance and $0.90 higher than Q3 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $855 million, up 324% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $1.6 billion, up 215% from $517 million year-over-year. The increase in RPO is consistent with the strong demand and execution in the quarter. We expect to recognize approximately 72% or $1.2 billion of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 64% or $330 million in Q3 last year.  We ended Q3 with approximately $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had exceptional operating cash flow in Q3 of $412 million, up from $62 million in Q3 last year. Free cash flow was $388 million, up from $55 million in Q3 last year. The increase is attributable to strong billings and collections. For the fourth quarter, we expect to have additional capital expenditures related to the build out of our data center infrastructure. And as a reminder, we will see the semi-annual cadence of net cash outflows from ESPP purchases to occur in Q4.  Now turning to guidance, we\u2019re pleased to raise our outlook for FY21 for both revenue and non-GAAP profitability. And although we remain optimistic on Zoom\u2019s outlook, please note that the impact and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated economic concerns remain largely unknown. Our higher outlook for FY21 is based on our current perspective of the business environment. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $806 million to $811 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $243 million to $248 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.77 to $0.79 based on approximately 306 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY21, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.75 [ph] [Sic, $2.575] billion to $2.58 billion, which would be approximately 314% year-over-year growth.  We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $865 million to $870 million which would be approximately 876% to 881% year-over-year growth. Our outlook for the non-GAAP earnings per share is $2.85 to $2.87, based on approximately 300 million shares outstanding. In closing, as the world is changing, Zoom is privileged to be a driving force enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless and secured communications platform. Thank you to the entire Zoom team. With that, let\u2019s open it up for questions. If you\u2019ve not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue up our first question. \nOperator: And our first question is from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.\nPhilip Winslow: Hi. Yes. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on another fabulous quarter. I really want to focus in on that customer segment with fewer than 10 employees, obviously, strong again this quarter. Really two questions here that I want to focus on. First, you talked about some initiatives over the past couple of calls to translate more of these customers from monthly to annual contracts. Wondering if you could give us an update on that? And then second question is, I wonder if you could compare and contrast maybe the trends that you're seeing in terms of Zoom Phone attach between these small businesses and then 10% plus -- I'm sorry, 10 employee-plus segment?\nKelly Steckelberg: So in terms of the activities that we're doing to convert those monthly customers to annual, those continue. It's a significant part of the focus of our marketing team, and we have seen movement in that area. It's not something we're going to talk about really specifically, but we're excited about the prospects and people to continue to see the value of Zoom and want to connect to longer-term agreements. So that's great.  And then in terms of Zoom Phone, what's great about this, we have seen consistent performance across all segments of the business, all the way from small business up to enterprise. In fact, as we continue to see strong performance in Zoom Phone, we once again had our highest deal to date in Q3. So very excited about continuing to see progress there.\nPhilip Winslow: Great. Thanks, Kelly. And once again, thanks for your support of K-12 education. I've been on two Zooms with my daughter\u2019s school over the past few weeks. Thank you for that.\nKelly Steckelberg: Great. Thank you, Phil.\nTom McCallum: Next question please, Matt. \nOperator: Our next question is from Bhavan Suri with William Blair.\nBhavan Suri : Hey, guys. Let me echo my congrats there. Two quick ones. One, Kelly, on linearity in the quarter, was there any in terms of deals? And then really quickly, as you look at the expansion of the product, you've built Zoom Phone, you've got the PBX work, and you've got a global -- you've gone into various areas, but a natural extension might be something like call center. I\u2019d love to understand how you think about that opportunity, and what you might -- is that an area you might explore, an area you might visit? Or is that sort of too far afield? \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, great to see you, Bhavan. Thank you. So in terms of Q3 linearity, it was more front-end loaded than our traditional seasonality, especially as we continue to see strength in that customer base with fewer than 10 employees, that many of them are buying online and they're buying via credit card. What we expect to see as, especially as we move into Q4, that we're going to start, and as we move more towards fulfillment through our direct sales channel, that it will be more back-end loaded and more kind of our traditional seasonality that we saw pre-COVID. And then, in terms of call center strategy, we agree with you. The call center contact center is a really important part of the strategy around Zoom Phone. And the way we're approaching that today is through partnerships with many of the great contact center providers that are out there today. And we think that works really well as we have strong integrations with them. And it gives our customers the opportunity to work with the contact center provider of their choice, but to do it with Zoom Phone in a very seamless way.\nBhavan Suri : Got it. Thank you. \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. So Kelly, I want to circle back to the customers with less than 10 employees. And specifically, you made the comment that churn was better than expected in the quarter. Was that attributable to the entire customer base, or specifically to these smaller customers?\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Sterling. Churn was actually better across all segments of the business. So as we \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, the marketing team is very focused on trying to convert monthly to annual customers in that fewer than 10 base. But we've also seen, even in the upmarket people that are also expanding, continuing to buy more products, which makes them more integrated into the Zoom ecosystem and makes them more retentive. So we saw that across all segments of the business actually.\nSterling Auty: Should the under 10% of revenue, the 38% perhaps fall back as you get in to that end-of-year budget flush and maybe bigger spend by large enterprise?\nKelly Steckelberg: We think certainly over time that we will move back towards more of our sales and bookings being dominated by our direct sales channel, which then yes, would ultimately eventually drive down that percentage of revenue from the fewer than 10 employee base. \nSterling Auty: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hey, Kelly. Hope you had a great holiday. I know our focus would be here on Zoom Phone. But just curious on OnZoom, it's still in beta is my understanding. But how has the monetization strategy developed over the last few weeks since Zoomtopia? What commission does Zoom take? And is there any way to think about the size of this business a few years down the road? And if I can squeeze in a second one, additionally, what percentage of revenue this quarter came from the greater than $100,000 customers this quarter?\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay. Hi, James, great to see you. In terms of OnZoom, yes, it is still in beta at this point. And we have not yet announced what our monetization strategy is around that platform. We've certainly been working on internally, but we're more focused on ensuring that the platform is ready and is meeting the needs of not only the host, but also the customers and making that a really seamless transition or transaction for them. I hope you saw the video, some of the really cool things that are happening on the platform. And if you guys haven't checked it out, just go look, and you can see the classes and events that are happening there.  We will announce our monetization strategy probably sometime next year. But in terms of how we're thinking about it, we don't expect it to have a significant contribution to revenue next year. And we're really focusing on building out the platform itself.  And then in terms of your second question, that percentage of revenue from customers greater than 100. Yes, I need to look, sorry, one second. I just need to look and see exactly what that is. Let me come back to you, James. I have it my stuff. Let me come back to you. \nJames Fish: Just have Tom or come back to me later. Sounds good. Thank you.\nOperator: All right. The next question will be from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Hi, thanks. So you noted at Zoomtopia kind of expansion capability or expansion room within the Global 2K, given a lot of room to grow within that customer subset. I just wanted to see how do you feel that you\u2019re staffed to attack that opportunity? Do you feel you\u2019re staffed up to attack the Global 2K? And then maybe just in terms of, you have a pretty meaningful cash balance at this point. There\u2019s meaningful M&A kind of being discussed in the space. How does that change kind of your viewpoint of how you're looking at M&A? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Meta, nice to see you. So certainly, in terms of addressing and how we\u2019re staffed to serve and take share - continue to take share in the Global 2K, international expansion is a huge area of focus for us, and we talked a little bit about this in the past. But with the increase of brand awareness around the globe, it has really created an opportunity for us to hire into markets very quickly, where historically it would have taken us time to see those markets with marketing spend and now we're able to just go in there, because we're seeing tremendous demand. So we're excited about the opportunity. And yes, Abe Smith and our international team are growing very quickly to address that. And then, in terms of cash balance and M&A, we certainly continuously watch for opportunities to do something with that cash, that would be additive. I think we've talked about in the past, we would look for opportunities in M&A that could either extend our technology or our talents. And those are the two areas that we're continuously watching for the right opportunity.\nMeta Marshall: Thanks. \nTom McCallum: Hi, this is Tom. Just wanted to point out on the last question that James asked, it is 18% coming from the greater than 100k.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Tom.\nOperator: Next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. \nHeather Bellini: Hey, Kelly, thank you so much. I\u2019ve two quick questions. One, just -- I guess, just thinking about chat functionality and team-based chat collaboration specifically, given that category has seen tremendous growth during the pandemic as well. And just giving the competitive dynamics there right now, if you guys have any thoughts on how you see that playing out and your ability to compete there. And also just a follow-up, how much Zoom Phone, driving customers over 100,000 were -- you continue to have another really big quarter there in terms of adds.\nKelly Steckelberg: So our chat product is a really important part of our overall product suite, especially when you look at Zoom Phone. It's a very natural tie into it. And as we've seen the expansion in Zoom Phone we've seen customers continue to ask for more features and functionality and we certainly are committed to continuing to develop and innovate around Zoom Chat. And as a reminder, it does come embedded with our meetings product itself.  And then in terms of how much Zoom Phone is driving customers greater than 100k, I don't think that we have explicitly called out the number of Zoom Phone customers we have in that specific category. As we said about Zoom Phone metrics, we'll continue to look at opportunities for milestone metrics along the way. And that could be something we would disclose in the future. We just haven't done it yet today.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you. \nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Heather.\nOperator: Next question is from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Hi, Kelly. Thanks for taking my question. I was wanting to ask about the sales productivity. You added a lot of sales people this year. So could you talk about the sales productivity in fiscal Q3, million dollar up market? And what are you assuming in terms of productivity or expense in the up market segment in your fiscal Q4 guidance?\nKelly Steckelberg: So in Q3, we continue to see strong sales productivity across all segments of the business. But when you care -- when you look at the results, from Q1 to Q2 to Q3, they are starting to come down to down to more normalized rates. And when we're looking forward and thinking about Q4, and into next year, you should think about that our reps are returning to more normalized pre-COVID sales productivity levels. And that's how we're thinking about it. We're still obviously working on our FY22 plan but that's how we're thinking about it at a high level.\nSiti Panigrahi: Great, thank you. \nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks, Siti.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet : Hi, thanks for taking the question. Can you [technical difficulty] dig in a little bit more on the international side of the business? How are you seeing the sort of difference in terms of what the U.S. looks like? And then secondarily, are you have any markets that are -- were a little bit more difficult to penetrate, whether it's from security or infrastructure elements that are now either being invested in or you've sort of gotten past those impediments to start?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So let me talk about the second part of the question, first, in terms of security and privacy, we've obviously focused a lot on this as a company on a global basis over the last nine months. And all of the initiatives that we have taken certainly have borne fruit. As we've continued to invest as well as putting teams in local markets, that helps a lot with also building the trust and confidence of the customer base there. So certainly we've seen the progress there. And then, in terms of what was the question, how is the US different in terms of -- did you ask about minutes usage, is that what you asked? \nMatthew VanVliet : No, just mix of, are you seeing larger customers, whether it's our [ph] customers, are there more kind of individuals there, any differences? \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Again, we've seen strength across all segments internationally. You remember, I think it was last quarter, our largest customer in the quarter was an international customer. So we're really excited about the progress we're continuing to make there.\nMatthew VanVliet : Thank you. \nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Will Power with Baird.\nWill Power : Great, thanks. Yes. Kelly, you noted the really strong usage growth, I guess, sequentially. You cited 75% usage growth. Anyway to kind of help frame how much that was driven by education versus broader verticals. I guess the other way to kind of cut that would be to kind of look at any color, you could provide around, free growth generally versus we're seeing in terms of paid growth. And I've a second question. \nKelly Steckelberg: So as I said in the prepared remarks, a large percentage of the growth in the usage was from education, but both free and paid. And paid is certainly an elevated percentage of our total usage. Education continues to be one of our strong verticals. It was the second fastest growing vertical again in Q3. So really excited about the progress we continue to make there as well. \nWill Power : Okay, and then my second question, you noted the record number of 100,000 [ph] customers in the quarter, which was great. Anything you'd point to with respect to key drivers that -- were there any particular verticals that stood out among that largest cohort, geographies and stood out, any changes in go to market? Kind of what kind of drove the improvement there? \nKelly Steckelberg: No, I think that it was really diversified across all markets, all segments and all verticals as well. I think it's more about the continued expansion in our sales organization as well as the increased brand awareness. And as companies are continuing to think about the extension of this remote working and ensuring that they are keeping their employees productive as well as safe during this time.\nWill Power : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Taz Koujalgi with Guggenheim.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on the average deal sizes. If you look at the number of new customers you're adding every quarter that has gone down, which is expected. But can you comment on the average deal sizes for new consumers? Has that changed at all, the last few quarters, the initial land sizes?\nKelly Steckelberg: We haven't seen a significant change in our overall deal size. If you remember, land and expand is still a very important part of our sales strategy. And we see customers doing it. We also see customers that are starting with for example, Zoom Meetings, and then add on -- two of the customers we talked about today, Peloton and Rakuten, that added on Zoom Phone later. So not really a significant change in the overall deal size, especially at the start.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citi.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hey, Walter. \nWalter Pritchard: There we are. Okay. Sorry about that. You noted that churn was below what you expected. But I'm wondering within that -- of the customers that did churn, did you notice any trends or commonality that seemed to be coincident or causing the churn that you could help us understand?\nKelly Steckelberg: No, it's -- the churn correlate somewhat to the overall pandemic. And so as we continue to see uncertainty in terms of markets, locations, with shutdown, or shelter in place orders, we see variance. We see the most volatility, of course, in the segment of customers with 10 or fewer employees. But even that was at an improved level than what we were originally forecasting. As I talked about before that's due in part to these actions where we're having success. It's definitely converting customers from monthly to annual contracts.\nWalter Pritchard: Thank you. \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from Zane Chrane with Bernstein.\nZane Chrane: Hi, Kelly, thanks for taking the time. I was wondering if you could explain to us what portion of business customers are on the active host pricing model versus a named host pricing model? And why do you make that distinction? What does it mean for you in terms of strategy, adoption, overall growth? And then I have a quick follow up. \nKelly Steckelberg: Sure, hi, Zane. So in terms of the approach, and why we have active hosts versus named hosts is because it allows customers that aren't sure exactly what their uses are going to be, to come in and buy Zoom at a level that feels comfortable to them, and then grow into that. So it's a very effective mechanism for maybe somebody that's newly adopting video communications, or expanding and extending it to a part of their organization that may not have used it before. And it's a great way for them to have the opportunity to assess what that level of usage is going to be.  In terms of what percentage comes from that, that's not something that we disclose. It's really a mix, depending on the customer segments, and how those customers want to buy.\nZane Chrane: That's helpful. And as far as the customers that are on the active host pricing model, how long is the lag? Or how should we think about the relationship between revenue and usage? Is it a one month lag between monetization versus usage? Is it a quarter? Is it a year? How should we think about that in general? \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, so the active host model is most prevalent in our up market customers. And the typical structure -- of course, again, we're focused on delivering happiness to our customers. So these are all things that are negotiable. The typical structure of a deal would be, they would have access to a certain -- a set number of licenses. They would pay for some fraction of that for the first year. And then after a year, we would look at where their high watermark was of usage for those hosts. And that would be their true up then for the next year. \nZane Chrane: So should we interpret that as meaning customers that have not hit that one year anniversary? Those may be in Q1 or Q2, that have expanded significantly in the last year, we should still see improved monetization of those in Q2, Q3 next year maybe? \nKelly Steckelberg: There's absolutely the potential in that scenario, that yes, there's a step up for those customers if they've expanded through where we started them in their minimum commitments at the beginning of their contract. Yes. \nZane Chrane: Super helpful. Thank you very much and congrats again. \nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks Zane.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thank you so much. Hi, Kelly. Hey, Tom. How are you guys doing? \nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Brad. I'm good. How are you? \nBrad Zelnick: Very well. Thank you. I echo my congrats. Just a question, following up on an earlier question about geographies, seems healthy growth all around. But if I look at EMEA, only 5%, growth sequentially, just -- any reason to call out why it would be a little bit weaker relative to the Americas or Asia-Pac?\nKelly Steckelberg: No, nothing significant there to call out. Some of these regions are just impacted by larger deals in the quarter, and otherwise nothing significant really happening that's of note. Again, some of the growth across these regions is dependent upon where these markets are from the pandemic sort of cycle. And if you look back to Q3, I think at the beginning of Q3, Europe was in a very optimistic situation. And unfortunately, we've seen sort of some of that reverting as we've gotten to the back half of Q3. So it's a little bit variable with what's happening in the overall pandemic itself. \nBrad Zelnick: Great. If I could throw in a follow-up for you, just on the channel strategy, any updates that you can share? What's the measure of success there? And how are you performing against that?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So first of all, the channel continues to be important part of our long term strategy, especially internationally and around Zoom Phone itself. And the way that we measure it internally, or one of the ways that we measure it internally is by looking at the percentage of revenue that is touched, is touched -- come through the channel or is touched through the channel. That's not something that we've disclosed publicly in a long time, but it might be something that we continue to evaluate for potential disclosure in the future.\nBrad Zelnick: Great, thank you so much for taking the question. \nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Brad.\nOperator: Up next we have Richard Valera with Needham. Hey Richard, can you unmute?\nRichard Valera : Sorry about that. Sorry. Hi, Kelly. Sorry about that.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hey, Rich.\nRichard Valera : Yes, so question on operating margins. You looked like this quarter, you finally started to see expenses catching up with revenue. And you had that expected decline in op margin. You\u2019re guiding for another one in the fourth quarter. I think last quarter, you said you expected several quarters of decreasing operating margins. And I know that kind of takes us into fiscal \u201821. Can you talk about how you think about that trajectory of expenses versus revenue and op margins for the next few quarters? \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, so I think if you look across some of our areas of functional spend, we want to continue to invest in R&D. That is an area we're absolutely focused on prioritizing, hiring at 3% of revenue. We would really like that to be closer to our long term target margin of 8% to 10%. And then, of course, in sales as well, focusing on adding sales capacity, and also spending a little bit more around marketing, as we think about promoting Zoom Phone and some of the other new products and platforms like on Zoom.  So those are the areas that we're thinking about investing in. And that's over -- as we said over the long term, why you should expect to see that margin continue to decrease. \nRichard Valera : Got it, just a quick follow up, if I could on phone. You've added a lot of functionality to that product over its short lifetime. And I guess most recently really expanded the international footprint. Where are you now in terms of where you want that product to be? And where you need to be competitively Are there any major outstanding features or functionality you think you need to add to phone to complete it? \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, we think we're very well situated from a competitive feature and functionality perspective. And as you said, we announced last quarter that we're in 44 markets from a native Zoom Phone deployment perspective. So really feel great about the progress we've made around that and are excited about the continued progress that we're seeing in Phone. \nRichard Valera : Great. Thanks, Kelly. \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rishi Jaluria with DA Davidson. \nRishi Jaluria : Hey, Kelly, thanks so much for taking my questions. Nice to see continued strength in the business. Just wanted to touch on gross margins again. Look, I think the rationale of free users makes a ton of sense, especially given you're enabling K-12. And you're doing some very customer friendly things like removing the free limits on Thanksgiving, so people don't have to travel, which, we all appreciate you doing those things? Can you help us I think directly understand how big of an impact is that -- is there? And since you're talking about this impact going into next year, is there a point at which it makes sense actually start to break down the cost associated with free customers?  And then just along -- a follow up on the Zoom Phone side, apologize if you already mentioned this, but how many only Zoom Phone seats you added within the quarter? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So hi, Rishi, thanks to you too. In terms of the gross margin, as we [technical difficulty] also looking on the holidays like Thanksgiving, and we're really excited about the opportunity for us to do that. At this point, we aren\u2019t prepared to give you a change in the outlook around gross margin and for the foreseeable future, you should expect it to be in this range, for at least several quarters before it eventually starts moving again back towards our long term target. And then in terms of breaking out the free, I don't think we're going to want to break out. We really value our free customers, our free hosts, and we think they're a very -- they continue to be a very important part of this ecosystem. So I think of it as if we weren't -- if we didn't have them sitting in our gross margin, they would be sitting in sales and marketing in terms of those expenses. So this is just the way that we've chosen to build our go-to-market and that's just what the trade-off compares to other companies why you might see a difference in those functional spend.\nRishi Jaluria : Thank you. I'm sorry, just in terms of Zoom Phone seats out in the quarter, did you\u2026? \nKelly Steckelberg: Sorry, yes, we don't disclose -- we're not disclosing exactly the number of seats added in any quarter. I will tell you as I said, we had the highest, the largest deal to date in Q3 and other record setting deals. So very excited about that. \nRishi Jaluria : Wonderful. Thank you, Kelly.\nOperator: The next question is from Alex Zukin with RBC.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, Kelly and Tom. Thanks for taking the question, and congrats on a good quarter. I guess Kelly, we haven't talked a lot about next year. I know you're not guiding to next year. But you can imagine the question we get all the time from investors is, how does Zoom grow post-pandemic, was this a pull forward? And as people go back to work, do they turn -- school, do they turn off their Zoom?  So given the commentary that you that you talked about with respect to churn rate for the business being better than you expected, given the commentary around Zoom Phone attach? Again, not asking for specific guidance, but at a high level, how would you think -- how would you kind of talk to us about calibrating growth for next year? Is it more going to be swung by churn, is it more going to be swung by Zoom Phone attach, any clarity you can provide, I think would go a long way. \nKelly Steckelberg: Sure, I think a couple of things. First of all, the remote working trends that started pre-pandemic have certainly accelerated during this period of time. And while we all hope for a vaccine as soon as possible, I think that remote work trends are here to stay. And we're excited about some of the features and functionality that we announced at Zoomtopia, for example, to enable this and to support customers and employees that are thinking about potentially going back to work likely in some sort of a hybrid work environment.  So these are things like Smart Gallery, which are really meant to enable better communications when people -- some of the employees are working remotely and some of them are in the office. So we're really looking towards supporting an environment like that, and believe that our -- especially our up market, customers are going to continue to want to provide that flexibility to their employees.  And then, in terms of key growth drivers, absolutely. Zoom Phone is one of the key drivers for next year. It was absolutely the fastest growing product in Q3. So excited to see that momentum. And if you think about this significant base of Zoom meetings customers that we've acquired in Q1, Q2 and Q3, they are there to continue to support our strategy of selling into our install base. And we absolutely expect that to be a key driver for next year.\nAlex Zukin: And then just as a follow up Kelly on churn, right, if you think about the cohorts and breaking down those churn rates, and particularly on the consumer cohort, what is the assumption for Q4 and then as you go now -- as you start to go into a more vaccine-led world, again, even when you do give guidance, it's not like you're going to have great -- you are seeing some engagement trends globally from some regions that are in a different stage of the pandemic today. But what's going to give you the confidence around that -- those churn assumptions for next year? \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, I mean, we are taking an approach where we can't predict the pandemic and so we are taking what we believe is a prudent approach. We do assume that the churn in the mass market, so the customers with fewer than 10 will continue to be elevated compared to both, the pre-pandemic level that we saw, as well as extremely elevated compared to the up market segment of our customer base.  So our -- overall, like the relative assumptions haven't changed. We've just seen slight improvements from what we were expecting. I think that's due to many factors we've already talked about, people continuing to see the value in Zoom, people embracing this remote work and assuming this is how this is going to be for a very long time, as well as the efforts that we're making to help people see the value and convert from monthly to annual.\nAlex Zukin: Great, thank you so much. Stay safe.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Alex. Thank you, you too.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt Securities.\nRyan Koontz: Hi, great. Thanks for the question. Can you expand a little bit in your relationship with the Lumen Technologies, former CenturyLink, a little bit there? And do you envision that\u2019s something that you would expand the DSP market, potential channel relationships? How do you frame that up? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So as I mentioned earlier, channel continues to be an area of focus and an opportunity for growth for us. We don't really comment on specific relationships, because we love all of our channel partners equally. But certainly this is an area that will be a driver -- an area driving growth for next year.\nRyan Koontz: Helpful, thank you. \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question is from Tom Roderick with Stifel.\nTom Roderick: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Hi, Kelly, great to see you. Thanks for doing this. So I want to go back -- the one question before was sort of on operating margin and the leverage in the model, and obviously, the investments in sales and marketing, we all get that. Very interesting to see R&D be down sequentially, especially with all of the advancements, enhancements that we've seen in the product. Can you talk a little bit a bit more about just structurally R&D? How much more do you need to throw at it for Zoom Phone on Zoom? We've seen a lot of developments just with the numbers where they're at.  And then, as they come back to structurally, geographically does R&D just rise over time as you disperse geographies or help us think about that as we go into next year. \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, sure. So in terms of the dollar decrease that you mentioned, from Q2 to Q3, that's due to the fact that there was a pretty significant consulting agreement in Q2, related to continuing to build out security and privacy on the platform. And that's why you see that decrease from a dollar perspective, quarter-over-quarter. And then long term, our target R&D is to be 10%-ish. That's really where we want that level of investment to be. And your point is exactly right. It will start to increase naturally, as we diversify our talent pool, in terms of geographic locations and hiring. We\u2019re really focused on hiring the best talent wherever they are. And working remotely has really enabled us to do that and define great talent in multiple locations in the U.S., and also continuing to expand as we've talked about previously in India, as well.  So all of that will help us not only increase our spending, as it diversifies our talent pool and opportunity for hiring, but also to give us this 24/7, follow the sun development approach as well.\nTom Roderick: Yes, and I'm glad you mentioned the consulting agreement. So just really quickly as a follow-up, I mean, you got the end to end encryption, really, quite quickly. What's been the feedback from corporate clients on that? And how has the performance of the overall system held up relative to keeping that an option for all customers out there and not just paying?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, so just to clarify, it is available today for all free and paid customers with up to 200 participants in their meeting. So far we are in this state of -- it's generally available but in technical review. So taking feedback from our customers, and so far, that has largely been positive. And we haven't seen any impact that would indicate that we need to approach our go to market any differently with it.\nTom Roderick: Great. Congratulations. Thank you. \nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you. Thank you, Tom.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ittia Kidron with Oppenheimer. \nIttia Kidron : Thanks. Hi, Kelly. Thanks again, great results. Just a clarification and a question for me as a clarification regarding Alex's question on churn, just to make sure I understand your churn change assumptions heading into the fourth quarter. Are you assuming the same assumption that you made heading into the third quarter or you're taking the churn assumption that actually transpired in actual in the third quarter?  And then my question is about the vertical depth -- I'm sorry, the Federal vertical, it is a September quarter that you ran for the vertical. So it fell within your October quarter. How did God behave and how does the pipeline look around that vertical going forward? \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So as we are looking into Q4, we continue to assume that the churn assumptions that we're using are more consistent -- we're using modeling are more consistent with how we were thinking about it as we came into Q3. And not necessarily assuming that we see that improvement that came to actuality in Q3. And then in terms of the verticals heading into Q4, I mentioned early education was one of our strongest growing verticals, government was actually our strongest growing vertical quarter-over-quarter in Q3. So excited about the progress that team is continuing to make. \nIttia Kidron : That's great. Thanks. \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, thank you, Ittia.\nOperator: Our next question is from Shelby Seyrafi with FBN Securities. Hey, Shelby, are you there? \nShelby Seyrafi: Can you hear me? \nOperator: Yes, here we go. \nKelly Steckelberg: There you are, hi, Shelby.\nShelby Seyrafi: Yes, hi. So on the gross margin, which was pressured in Q3, and you're lowering the outlook for the near term. Was the bigger factor, the free usage or the public cloud, increase?\nKelly Steckelberg: They are both having about the same impact honestly. It's a pretty comparable split between the two. \nShelby Seyrafi: Okay. And the second one I have for you, is we're in the middle of a brutal second wave. And obviously, last time when the first wave hit, you guys benefited a lot. So I'm just trying to see if, over the past month or two, you've seen some inflection point higher than the typical trend over the past six months, because of the second wave?\nKelly Steckelberg: I wouldn't say that we've seen an inflection point like we experienced in Q1. \nShelby Seyrafi: No, I know that, but just slightly higher, because of the second wave, any kind of positive effect.\nKelly Steckelberg: It's really early. I think that -- I mean, whichever way you're describing of when you're characterizing the second wave is happening, some of that would be falling into Q4. And thus that would be reflected in the guidance that we just gave in terms of what we're currently seeing around the business environment that we're seeing based on what we understand to be true around the pandemic. \nShelby Seyrafi: Okay, thanks a lot. \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nOperator: All right. We have time for one more question. So our last question is from Ryan McWilliams with Stephens.\nRyan MacWilliams: Hey, Kelly. Thanks, guys for squeezing me in once again.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hey, Ryan.\nRyan MacWilliams: One thing we haven't talked about recently is Zoom Rooms, and maybe I'm taking an optimistic approach here. But hopefully as things return to normal into next year, are you seeing enterprises starting discussions now about rationalizing their office footprint and video enabling more Zoom Rooms, and just talk about how that's changing? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, we actually are. So we're seeing customers that are taking this opportunity while their offices are empty to update or put in Zoom Rooms. And especially thinking about how this is going to work if they potentially go back in a hybrid environment and how they're going to create an inclusive environment, if they have an employee workforce that is now split between remote and people working in the office. That's why I'm so excited about for example, Smart Gallery, which is really going to enable and empower an experience that's beneficial, and really maintains this -- I will call the democratization communication that's been created as we're all working from home, right. All of our squares the same size on this screen.  And so Smart Gallery is going to enable companies to continue to provide that to their remote workers when we eventually start to go back in some sort of a hybrid approach.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the results. \nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, thank you, Ryan.\nOperator: That was our last question for today. \nKelly Steckelberg: Okay. Thank you, Matt. And thank you all so much for joining us. We appreciate your support during Q3, and thank you again to all of our Zoom employees that made our quarter possible.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, everyone.",

            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Hello, everybody. We're so glad you could join us today. In Q3, we continued to be inspired by the many creative ways our customers have been using Zoom to work anywhere, learn anywhere and connect anywhere. Let me start by reviewing our financial results for Q3, then discuss our increased outlook for Q4 and the full-year FY 2021. Total revenue grew 367% year-over-year to $777 million in Q3, achieving a $3 billion revenue run rate. This top line result exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $690 million due to strong sales and marketing execution in both our online and direct businesses, as well as lower-than-expected churn. For the quarter, the year-over-year growth in revenue was primarily due to subscriptions provided to new customers, which accounted for approximately 81% of the increase, while subscriptions provided to existing customers accounted for approximately 19% of the increase. This demand was broad-based across products, industry verticals, geographies and customer cohorts. Let's take a look at the key customer metrics for Q3. We continue to see expansion in the upmarket as we ended Q3 with 1,289 customers generating more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue, up 136% year-over-year. This is an increase of more than 300 customers over Q2, the highest number of adds we have had in a quarter. We exited the quarter with a total of approximately 433,700 customers with more than 10 employees. We added approximately 63,500 of these customers during Q3. Year-over-year, we added approximately 360,000 new customers with more than 10 employees, representing a 485% increase. In Q3, customers with more than 10 employees represented approximately 62% of revenue. We also continue to benefit from significant growth in our segment of customers with 10 or fewer employees, as small businesses and individuals adopted and maintained their Zoom licenses. In Q3, customers with 10 or fewer employees represented approximately 38% of revenue, up from 36% in Q2. Our net dollar expansion for customers with more than 10 employees was over 130% for the 10th consecutive quarter as existing customers continue to support and trust Zoom to be their video communications platform of choice. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Americas grew over 300% year-over-year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew 629% year-over-year and was consistent with Q2 at 31% of revenue. We plan to continue to invest in international expansion to capitalize on our brand awareness and the increased global opportunity. Now turning to profitability. The increase in demand and strong execution drove net income profitability from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin in the third quarter was 68.2%, compared to 82.9% in Q3 last year and 72.3% last quarter. The impact to our gross margin is partially due to the dramatic increase in usage related to the pandemic, as we are experiencing a higher percentage of free users, including those in over 125,000 K-12 educational institutions that went back to school in the fall. It is also due to the continued higher utilization of public cloud services.  We ended the quarter with an annualized run rate of 3.5 trillion meeting minutes, approximately 75% growth quarter-over-quarter. We are thrilled that a significant percentage of the usage was from both paid and free participants in the education sector, as millions of students and teachers returned to the classroom virtually. With the uncertainty of the longevity of the pandemic, it is unclear how long gross margins will be impacted as we remain committed to supporting the global community. Consequently, we expect gross margins to be consistent with Q3 into the next fiscal year before starting to improve towards our long-term target margin. R&D expense in Q3 was approximately $25 million, up 80% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense was approximately 3%, which was lower than Q3 last year mainly due to the strong top line growth. We are committed to prioritize R&D hiring to drive further innovation, expansion and security into our platform. Sales and marketing expense for Q3 was $141 million. This reflects an increase of 71% or $59 million over last year primarily due to investments to drive future growth. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing expense was approximately 18%, a decrease from Q3 last year mainly due to strong top line growth and marketing efficiencies from the virtual production of Zoomtopia. We plan to continue to invest in adding sales capacity and marketing programs over the next several quarters to capture market share and to deliver on our growth opportunities. G&A expense in Q3 was $73 million, up 257% on a year-over-year basis as we continued to scale our G&A functions to support a company of our size. As a percentage of total revenue, G&A expense was approximately 9%, a decrease from Q3 last year. The revenue upside in the quarter carried over to the bottom line, with non-GAAP operating income of $291 million exceeding our guidance. This translates to a 37.4% non-GAAP operating margin for the third quarter. This is an increase compared to Q3 last year's result of 12.8%, and a decrease from Q2 FY21's margin of 41.7%. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q3 was $0.99, on approximately 299 million of non-GAAP, weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.25 more than the high end of our guidance and $0.90 higher than Q3 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $855 million, up 324% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $1.6 billion, up 215% from $517 million year-over-year. The increase in RPO is consistent with the strong demand and execution in the quarter. We expect to recognize approximately 72% or $1.2 billion of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 64% or $330 million in Q3 last year.  We ended Q3 with approximately $1.9 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had exceptional operating cash flow in Q3 of $412 million, up from $62 million in Q3 last year. Free cash flow was $388 million, up from $55 million in Q3 last year. The increase is attributable to strong billings and collections. For the fourth quarter, we expect to have additional capital expenditures related to the build out of our data center infrastructure. And as a reminder, we will see the semi-annual cadence of net cash outflows from ESPP purchases to occur in Q4.  Now turning to guidance, we're pleased to raise our outlook for FY21 for both revenue and non-GAAP profitability. And although we remain optimistic on Zoom's outlook, please note that the impact and extent of the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated economic concerns remain largely unknown. Our higher outlook for FY21 is based on our current perspective of the business environment. For the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $806 million to $811 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $243 million to $248 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.77 to $0.79 based on approximately 306 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY21, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.75 [ph] [Sic, $2.575] billion to $2.58 billion, which would be approximately 314% year-over-year growth.  We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $865 million to $870 million which would be approximately 876% to 881% year-over-year growth. Our outlook for the non-GAAP earnings per share is $2.85 to $2.87, based on approximately 300 million shares outstanding. In closing, as the world is changing, Zoom is privileged to be a driving force enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless and secured communications platform. Thank you to the entire Zoom team. With that, let's open it up for questions. If you've not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue up our first question. So in terms of the activities that we're doing to convert those monthly customers to annual, those continue. It's a significant part of the focus of our marketing team, and we have seen movement in that area. It's not something we're going to talk about really specifically, but we're excited about the prospects and people to continue to see the value of Zoom and want to connect to longer-term agreements. So that's great.  And then in terms of Zoom Phone, what's great about this, we have seen consistent performance across all segments of the business, all the way from small business up to enterprise. In fact, as we continue to see strong performance in Zoom Phone, we once again had our highest deal to date in Q3. So very excited about continuing to see progress there. Great. Thank you, Phil. Yes, great to see you, Bhavan. Thank you. So in terms of Q3 linearity, it was more front-end loaded than our traditional seasonality, especially as we continue to see strength in that customer base with fewer than 10 employees, that many of them are buying online and they're buying via credit card. What we expect to see as, especially as we move into Q4, that we're going to start, and as we move more towards fulfillment through our direct sales channel, that it will be more back-end loaded and more kind of our traditional seasonality that we saw pre-COVID. And then, in terms of call center strategy, we agree with you. The call center contact center is a really important part of the strategy around Zoom Phone. And the way we're approaching that today is through partnerships with many of the great contact center providers that are out there today. And we think that works really well as we have strong integrations with them. And it gives our customers the opportunity to work with the contact center provider of their choice, but to do it with Zoom Phone in a very seamless way. Yes, thank you. Hi, Sterling. Churn was actually better across all segments of the business. So as we \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, the marketing team is very focused on trying to convert monthly to annual customers in that fewer than 10 base. But we've also seen, even in the upmarket people that are also expanding, continuing to buy more products, which makes them more integrated into the Zoom ecosystem and makes them more retentive. So we saw that across all segments of the business actually. We think certainly over time that we will move back towards more of our sales and bookings being dominated by our direct sales channel, which then yes, would ultimately eventually drive down that percentage of revenue from the fewer than 10 employee base. Okay. Hi, James, great to see you. In terms of OnZoom, yes, it is still in beta at this point. And we have not yet announced what our monetization strategy is around that platform. We've certainly been working on internally, but we're more focused on ensuring that the platform is ready and is meeting the needs of not only the host, but also the customers and making that a really seamless transition or transaction for them. I hope you saw the video, some of the really cool things that are happening on the platform. And if you guys haven't checked it out, just go look, and you can see the classes and events that are happening there.  We will announce our monetization strategy probably sometime next year. But in terms of how we're thinking about it, we don't expect it to have a significant contribution to revenue next year. And we're really focusing on building out the platform itself.  And then in terms of your second question, that percentage of revenue from customers greater than 100. Yes, I need to look, sorry, one second. I just need to look and see exactly what that is. Let me come back to you, James. I have it my stuff. Let me come back to you. Hi, Meta, nice to see you. So certainly, in terms of addressing and how we're staffed to serve and take share - continue to take share in the Global 2K, international expansion is a huge area of focus for us, and we talked a little bit about this in the past. But with the increase of brand awareness around the globe, it has really created an opportunity for us to hire into markets very quickly, where historically it would have taken us time to see those markets with marketing spend and now we're able to just go in there, because we're seeing tremendous demand. So we're excited about the opportunity. And yes, Abe Smith and our international team are growing very quickly to address that. And then, in terms of cash balance and M&A, we certainly continuously watch for opportunities to do something with that cash, that would be additive. I think we've talked about in the past, we would look for opportunities in M&A that could either extend our technology or our talents. And those are the two areas that we're continuously watching for the right opportunity. Thank you, Tom. So our chat product is a really important part of our overall product suite, especially when you look at Zoom Phone. It's a very natural tie into it. And as we've seen the expansion in Zoom Phone we've seen customers continue to ask for more features and functionality and we certainly are committed to continuing to develop and innovate around Zoom Chat. And as a reminder, it does come embedded with our meetings product itself.  And then in terms of how much Zoom Phone is driving customers greater than 100k, I don't think that we have explicitly called out the number of Zoom Phone customers we have in that specific category. As we said about Zoom Phone metrics, we'll continue to look at opportunities for milestone metrics along the way. And that could be something we would disclose in the future. We just haven't done it yet today. Thank you, Heather. So in Q3, we continue to see strong sales productivity across all segments of the business. But when you care -- when you look at the results, from Q1 to Q2 to Q3, they are starting to come down to down to more normalized rates. And when we're looking forward and thinking about Q4, and into next year, you should think about that our reps are returning to more normalized pre-COVID sales productivity levels. And that's how we're thinking about it. We're still obviously working on our FY22 plan but that's how we're thinking about it at a high level. Thanks, Siti. Yes. So let me talk about the second part of the question, first, in terms of security and privacy, we've obviously focused a lot on this as a company on a global basis over the last nine months. And all of the initiatives that we have taken certainly have borne fruit. As we've continued to invest as well as putting teams in local markets, that helps a lot with also building the trust and confidence of the customer base there. So certainly we've seen the progress there. And then, in terms of what was the question, how is the US different in terms of -- did you ask about minutes usage, is that what you asked? Yes. Again, we've seen strength across all segments internationally. You remember, I think it was last quarter, our largest customer in the quarter was an international customer. So we're really excited about the progress we're continuing to make there. Thank you, Matt. So as I said in the prepared remarks, a large percentage of the growth in the usage was from education, but both free and paid. And paid is certainly an elevated percentage of our total usage. Education continues to be one of our strong verticals. It was the second fastest growing vertical again in Q3. So really excited about the progress we continue to make there as well. No, I think that it was really diversified across all markets, all segments and all verticals as well. I think it's more about the continued expansion in our sales organization as well as the increased brand awareness. And as companies are continuing to think about the extension of this remote working and ensuring that they are keeping their employees productive as well as safe during this time. We haven't seen a significant change in our overall deal size. If you remember, land and expand is still a very important part of our sales strategy. And we see customers doing it. We also see customers that are starting with for example, Zoom Meetings, and then add on -- two of the customers we talked about today, Peloton and Rakuten, that added on Zoom Phone later. So not really a significant change in the overall deal size, especially at the start. Hey, Walter. No, it's -- the churn correlate somewhat to the overall pandemic. And so as we continue to see uncertainty in terms of markets, locations, with shutdown, or shelter in place orders, we see variance. We see the most volatility, of course, in the segment of customers with 10 or fewer employees. But even that was at an improved level than what we were originally forecasting. As I talked about before that's due in part to these actions where we're having success. It's definitely converting customers from monthly to annual contracts. Yes. Sure, hi, Zane. So in terms of the approach, and why we have active hosts versus named hosts is because it allows customers that aren't sure exactly what their uses are going to be, to come in and buy Zoom at a level that feels comfortable to them, and then grow into that. So it's a very effective mechanism for maybe somebody that's newly adopting video communications, or expanding and extending it to a part of their organization that may not have used it before. And it's a great way for them to have the opportunity to assess what that level of usage is going to be.  In terms of what percentage comes from that, that's not something that we disclose. It's really a mix, depending on the customer segments, and how those customers want to buy. Yes, so the active host model is most prevalent in our up market customers. And the typical structure -- of course, again, we're focused on delivering happiness to our customers. So these are all things that are negotiable. The typical structure of a deal would be, they would have access to a certain -- a set number of licenses. They would pay for some fraction of that for the first year. And then after a year, we would look at where their high watermark was of usage for those hosts. And that would be their true up then for the next year. There's absolutely the potential in that scenario, that yes, there's a step up for those customers if they've expanded through where we started them in their minimum commitments at the beginning of their contract. Yes. Thanks Zane. Hi, Brad. I'm good. How are you? No, nothing significant there to call out. Some of these regions are just impacted by larger deals in the quarter, and otherwise nothing significant really happening that's of note. Again, some of the growth across these regions is dependent upon where these markets are from the pandemic sort of cycle. And if you look back to Q3, I think at the beginning of Q3, Europe was in a very optimistic situation. And unfortunately, we've seen sort of some of that reverting as we've gotten to the back half of Q3. So it's a little bit variable with what's happening in the overall pandemic itself. Yes. So first of all, the channel continues to be important part of our long term strategy, especially internationally and around Zoom Phone itself. And the way that we measure it internally, or one of the ways that we measure it internally is by looking at the percentage of revenue that is touched, is touched -- come through the channel or is touched through the channel. That's not something that we've disclosed publicly in a long time, but it might be something that we continue to evaluate for potential disclosure in the future. Thank you, Brad. Hey, Rich. Yes, so I think if you look across some of our areas of functional spend, we want to continue to invest in R&D. That is an area we're absolutely focused on prioritizing, hiring at 3% of revenue. We would really like that to be closer to our long term target margin of 8% to 10%. And then, of course, in sales as well, focusing on adding sales capacity, and also spending a little bit more around marketing, as we think about promoting Zoom Phone and some of the other new products and platforms like on Zoom.  So those are the areas that we're thinking about investing in. And that's over -- as we said over the long term, why you should expect to see that margin continue to decrease. Yes, we think we're very well situated from a competitive feature and functionality perspective. And as you said, we announced last quarter that we're in 44 markets from a native Zoom Phone deployment perspective. So really feel great about the progress we've made around that and are excited about the continued progress that we're seeing in Phone. Yes, thank you. So hi, Rishi, thanks to you too. In terms of the gross margin, as we [technical difficulty] also looking on the holidays like Thanksgiving, and we're really excited about the opportunity for us to do that. At this point, we aren't prepared to give you a change in the outlook around gross margin and for the foreseeable future, you should expect it to be in this range, for at least several quarters before it eventually starts moving again back towards our long term target. And then in terms of breaking out the free, I don't think we're going to want to break out. We really value our free customers, our free hosts, and we think they're a very -- they continue to be a very important part of this ecosystem. So I think of it as if we weren't -- if we didn't have them sitting in our gross margin, they would be sitting in sales and marketing in terms of those expenses. So this is just the way that we've chosen to build our go-to-market and that's just what the trade-off compares to other companies why you might see a difference in those functional spend. Sorry, yes, we don't disclose -- we're not disclosing exactly the number of seats added in any quarter. I will tell you as I said, we had the highest, the largest deal to date in Q3 and other record setting deals. So very excited about that. Sure, I think a couple of things. First of all, the remote working trends that started pre-pandemic have certainly accelerated during this period of time. And while we all hope for a vaccine as soon as possible, I think that remote work trends are here to stay. And we're excited about some of the features and functionality that we announced at Zoomtopia, for example, to enable this and to support customers and employees that are thinking about potentially going back to work likely in some sort of a hybrid work environment.  So these are things like Smart Gallery, which are really meant to enable better communications when people -- some of the employees are working remotely and some of them are in the office. So we're really looking towards supporting an environment like that, and believe that our -- especially our up market, customers are going to continue to want to provide that flexibility to their employees.  And then, in terms of key growth drivers, absolutely. Zoom Phone is one of the key drivers for next year. It was absolutely the fastest growing product in Q3. So excited to see that momentum. And if you think about this significant base of Zoom meetings customers that we've acquired in Q1, Q2 and Q3, they are there to continue to support our strategy of selling into our install base. And we absolutely expect that to be a key driver for next year. Yes, I mean, we are taking an approach where we can't predict the pandemic and so we are taking what we believe is a prudent approach. We do assume that the churn in the mass market, so the customers with fewer than 10 will continue to be elevated compared to both, the pre-pandemic level that we saw, as well as extremely elevated compared to the up market segment of our customer base.  So our -- overall, like the relative assumptions haven't changed. We've just seen slight improvements from what we were expecting. I think that's due to many factors we've already talked about, people continuing to see the value in Zoom, people embracing this remote work and assuming this is how this is going to be for a very long time, as well as the efforts that we're making to help people see the value and convert from monthly to annual. Thank you, Alex. Thank you, you too. Yes. So as I mentioned earlier, channel continues to be an area of focus and an opportunity for growth for us. We don't really comment on specific relationships, because we love all of our channel partners equally. But certainly this is an area that will be a driver -- an area driving growth for next year. Yes. Yes, sure. So in terms of the dollar decrease that you mentioned, from Q2 to Q3, that's due to the fact that there was a pretty significant consulting agreement in Q2, related to continuing to build out security and privacy on the platform. And that's why you see that decrease from a dollar perspective, quarter-over-quarter. And then long term, our target R&D is to be 10%-ish. That's really where we want that level of investment to be. And your point is exactly right. It will start to increase naturally, as we diversify our talent pool, in terms of geographic locations and hiring. We're really focused on hiring the best talent wherever they are. And working remotely has really enabled us to do that and define great talent in multiple locations in the U.S., and also continuing to expand as we've talked about previously in India, as well.  So all of that will help us not only increase our spending, as it diversifies our talent pool and opportunity for hiring, but also to give us this 24/7, follow the sun development approach as well. Yes, so just to clarify, it is available today for all free and paid customers with up to 200 participants in their meeting. So far we are in this state of -- it's generally available but in technical review. So taking feedback from our customers, and so far, that has largely been positive. And we haven't seen any impact that would indicate that we need to approach our go to market any differently with it. Thank you. Thank you, Tom. Yes. So as we are looking into Q4, we continue to assume that the churn assumptions that we're using are more consistent -- we're using modeling are more consistent with how we were thinking about it as we came into Q3. And not necessarily assuming that we see that improvement that came to actuality in Q3. And then in terms of the verticals heading into Q4, I mentioned early education was one of our strongest growing verticals, government was actually our strongest growing vertical quarter-over-quarter in Q3. So excited about the progress that team is continuing to make. Yes, thank you, Ittia. There you are, hi, Shelby. They are both having about the same impact honestly. It's a pretty comparable split between the two. I wouldn't say that we've seen an inflection point like we experienced in Q1. It's really early. I think that -- I mean, whichever way you're describing of when you're characterizing the second wave is happening, some of that would be falling into Q4. And thus that would be reflected in the guidance that we just gave in terms of what we're currently seeing around the business environment that we're seeing based on what we understand to be true around the pandemic. Yes. Hey, Ryan. Yes, we actually are. So we're seeing customers that are taking this opportunity while their offices are empty to update or put in Zoom Rooms. And especially thinking about how this is going to work if they potentially go back in a hybrid environment and how they're going to create an inclusive environment, if they have an employee workforce that is now split between remote and people working in the office. That's why I'm so excited about for example, Smart Gallery, which is really going to enable and empower an experience that's beneficial, and really maintains this -- I will call the democratization communication that's been created as we're all working from home, right. All of our squares the same size on this screen.  And so Smart Gallery is going to enable companies to continue to provide that to their remote workers when we eventually start to go back in some sort of a hybrid approach. Yes, thank you, Ryan. Okay. Thank you, Matt. And thank you all so much for joining us. We appreciate your support during Q3, and thank you again to all of our Zoom employees that made our quarter possible."

            "content": "Hello, I hope you are all doing well. I am so sorry that I can't join you all live today, but I had a personal conflict arise. As we are in the season of Thanksgiving in the U.S., I wanted to express my ongoing gratitude for the commitment of our Zoom employees and the support of our customers, partners and investors during these unprecedented times. You all truly inspire and motivate us every day. Now let me share with you a few recent business highlights. First, revenue grew 367% year-over-year in Q3. Second, with a strong sales execution, our customers with more than 10 employees grew 485% year-over-year. And we are very delighted that, just recently, Gartner Research has named Zoom a leader in the 2020 Magic Quadrant for Meeting Solutions, as well as a leader in the Magic Quadrant for Unified Communications as a Service. This is the first year Zoom has qualified for inclusion in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for UCaaS and in the sixth year of Meeting Solutions. We are also very thrilled to welcome Secretary Janet Napolitano to our Board of Directors. We also had exciting wins in the quarter where customers committed to multiple Zoom products to provide a high-quality experience for their users. First, I would like to welcome Peloton to the Zoom family. Peloton is a leading interactive fitness platform. In Q3, Peloton consolidated to one vendor, buying both Zoom Meetings and Zoom Rooms to provide a more feature-rich video communication service to their employees. We are very honored to have Peloton committed to a long-term engagement, where they will deploy services across all locations and employees. A global customer increasing their commitment with Zoom is Rakuten. Rakuten is a global leader in Internet services with 1.4 billion members around the world. Impressed by the simplicity in the Zoom technology, the ease of facilitating the service and the feature-rich application, Rakuten has committed to the full Zoom UCaaS deployment. They have grown to 42,000 meetings licenses, more than 1,000 Zoom Rooms and are currently deploying Zoom Phones across the globe. We also want to recognize the Israel Ministry of Education, which oversees public education institutions. The Ministry of Education has enabled about 200,000 teachers and 1.2 million students to use Zoom. The leadership at the Ministry has told me that, Zoom became the most popular app for video meetings in Israel's schools because of its simplicity, stability and many options for security and privacy. Thank you for their hard work to provide for children's educational needs during this crisis. And to all educators around the globe, you are all heroes. Thank you, Peloton. Thank you, Rakuten. Thank you, Israel Ministry of Education. I love you all. Also thank you as well to all other customers. Your trust and happiness energize the entire Zoom team. Now let me talk about my favorite event of the year, Zoomtopia. In October, we had over 155,000 unique viewers attend Zoomtopia, our premier customer and community event. This year's event was held virtually on Zoom technology. We also had over 140 customer speakers, ranging from Fortune 50 companies to small businesses, and across all verticals, sharing stories of how they have integrated Zoom into all aspects of their communication and collaboration. We showcased several customers who are not just conducting their business over Zoom, they are reimagining and delivering new business services over Zoom as well, including the new OnZoom platform. I'm very proud of the Zoom team that delivered this successful event to our user community and at the size and scope that is truly incredible for virtual events. We were also able to demonstrate to the world that you can do this too with Zoom.  In summary, Zoom performed well for our customers and communities during the third quarter. I want to thank our over 3,800 employees who continue to scale our business and truly deliver happiness. With that, let me turn things over to Kelly, but first here is a look of what our new OnZoom platform has to offer. Thank you. [Audio-Visual Presentation]"

At this time, I'll hand it over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Matt. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Joining me today will be Zoom's Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan; and Zoom's CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page on the zoom.com Web site. Also, on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that along with our earnings release, including a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements about market size and growth strategy, our estimated and projected cost, margins, revenue, expenditures, investments, growth rates, our future financial performance, and other future events or trends, including guidance for the third quarter 2021 and full fiscal year 2021, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth initiative strategies and the impact to our business from the COVID-19 pandemic. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today's earnings press release and our latest 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement we may make on today's webinar. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Hey, Tom, thank you. Hello. I hope you are all doing well. I want to thank our customers, investors and community for their support of Zoom. Their care, feedback and trust of Zoom make a huge difference, and we grew our business from being a start-up to a [non start-up] [ph] public company to be a long-term sustainable company. We might be facing all kinds of challenges, but no matter how busy we are, no matter what challenges we are facing, we are always recharged when we think about our customers' support and become even more motivated to serve them better. With the pandemic persisting, we are very committed to work hard and are humbled by our role of enabling communications worldwide during this challenging time. As remote work trends have accelerated during the pandemic, organizations have moved beyond addressing immediate business continuity needs to actively redefining and embracing new approaches to support a future of working anywhere, learning anywhere and connecting anywhere, and we continued to see meaningful adoption of Zoom's video-first unified communication platform across industries and geographies. So, let me share with you just a few key metrics that reflect this. Revenue grew 355% year-over-year in Q2. Customers with more than 10 employees grew 458% year-over-year as new customers chose Zoom to be their preferred communication and collaboration solutions, and we had over 35,000 educators, school administrators, and IT professionals from around the world join our free virtual Zoom Summer Academy. The successful two-day Zoom event was our biggest educational event to date, bringing together thought leadership in remote learning, practical training and networking opportunities, and we remain committed to helping our education customers, including the more than 100,000 K-12 schools who have signed up to use the platform for free during the pandemic. Moving on to a few recent business highlights. We completed our 90-day plan on security and privacy. A comprehensive summary of accomplishment is available on our Web site. I'm very proud of our team's swift and transparent response as well as the resulting improvements we made to our platform. Although the 90-day initiative is over, security and privacy matters will remain an important part of Zoom's strategy and DNA moving forward as we strive to maintain our customers' and other stakeholders' trust. We also made two exciting hardware announcement in the quarter. First is the launch of Zoom Hardware as a Service, which offers customers a variety of subscription opportunities for phone and meeting room hardware from leading hardware manufacturers. This offering makes Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms more accessible by minimizing friction around hardware procurement. Second is Zoom for Home, our new innovative category of software experience and hardware device partnerships to support remote work use cases. We launched this program with our partner DTEN in July, and this month, we announced its expansion to Amazon, Facebook and Google devices. We also achieved significant accomplishments for Zoom Phone. In mid-June, Zoom Phone was authorized under the FedRAMP, enabling federal agencies to consolidate their costly, legacy telephony systems onto our unified modern cloud solutions. This month, we expanded the availability of Zoom Phone service to 25 additional countries and territories. Zoom now provides local telephone service and domestic calling in more than 40 countries and territories. On a final note, we welcome our new CISO, Jason Lee, former SVP of Security Operations at Salesforce, and our new General Counsel, Jeff True, former EVP and General Counsel at Palo Alto Networks. We are very excited to have them. Now let's talk about some exciting wins in the quarter. Let me start with a couple of new customers that represent some of the largest companies in their industry. First, we are thrilled to welcome ExxonMobil, one of the largest publicly traded international energy companies, to the Zoom family. ExxonMobil develops and applies next-generation technologies to help safely and responsibly meet the world's growing needs for energy and chemical products. They recently used their scale and capabilities to ramp up production to make medical-grade masks, shields and hand sanitizers. We are grateful that ExxonMobil chose Zoom as their unified communications platform. ExxonMobil wanted a solution that would enable them to collaborate reliably and securely with their teams, customers and partners around the world. ExxonMobil employees are now using Zoom video communications across their global business. Second, Activision Blizzard, a member of the Fortune 500, had chosen Zoom to modernize and consolidate onto a single communication platform across their business units and gaming franchises. As a leading interactive entertainment company, connecting and engaging the world through epic entertainment, Activision committed to a full enterprise rollout of Zoom Meeting and Zoom Rooms to increase their mix of legacy video conferencing products. Our ability to expand with existing customers also helped drive our results this quarter. One of the highlights this quarter was the expansion with ServiceNow, who has been a Zoom customer since 2018, using Zoom Meetings for its 11,000 global employees. Since the global pandemic, ServiceNow employees working from home have relied heavily on Zoom's easy-to-use interface to stay productive and connected with our customers. As the Zoom platform has become a core piece of ServiceNow's technology ecosystem, this past quarter, the company chose to replace its legacy hardware PBX system with Zoom Phone across their organization, further elevating their teams' work-anywhere experience with seamless, one-touch communication and collaboration. Thank you, ExxonMobil, Activision Blizzard, ServiceNow and all our wonderful customers for trusting Zoom. I love you. All Zoom employees love you. Thank you. In summary, we continued to scale and expand our business to meet the need of our customers and the global community. I'm very proud of our achievements and thank our more than 3,400 employees for another exceptional quarter. Let's remain focused on delivering happiness to our customers and community. With that, let me turn things over to Kelly.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. Q2 was a remarkable quarter for Zoom as we continued to rapidly grow and invest in our business to meet the demands of our customers and communities. Let me start by reviewing our financial results for Q2, then discuss our outlook for Q3 and the increased view of our full-year FY'21. Total revenue grew 355% year-over-year to $664 million in Q2. This top line results significantly exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $500 million as demand remained at heightened levels, combined with lower-than-expected churn and exceptional sales execution. For the quarter, the year-over-year growth in revenue was primarily due to subscription provided to new customers, which accounted for approximately 81% of the increase, while subscriptions provided to existing customers accounted for approximately 19% of the increase. This demand was broad-based across industry verticals, geographies and customer cohorts. Let's take a look at the key customer metrics for Q2. We continue to see expansion in the upmarket as we ended Q2 at 988 customers generating more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue, up 112% year-over-year. This is an increase of 219 customers over Q1, the highest number of adds in a quarter. We exited the quarter with a total of approximately 370,000 customers with more than 10 employees. We added approximately 105,000 of these customers in Q2, the second highest number of adds in any quarter. Year-over-year, we added approximately 304,000 new customers with more than 10 employees for 458% growth. We have continued to benefit from significant growth in our customer segment with 10 or fewer employees as small businesses and individuals adopted and maintained their Zoom licenses for various uses during the pandemic. In Q2, customers with 10 or fewer employees represented 36% of revenue, up from 30% in Q1 and 20% in Q4 of last year. The increase in customers with 10 or fewer employees continues to shift our billing mix as these customers generally pay monthly rather than annually as do most enterprise customers. This shift is an important point for our outlook, which I will discuss in just a moment. Our net dollar expansion for customers with more than 10 employees was over 130% for the ninth consecutive quarter as existing customers continue to support and trust Zoom to be their video communications platform of choice. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Americas grew at a rate of 288% year-over-year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue accelerated to 629% year-over-year and represented approximately 31% of revenue. We will continue to invest in international expansion to capitalize on our brand awareness and the increased global opportunity. Now turning to profitability, the increase in demand and strong execution drove net income profitability from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 72.3% compared to 82.2% in Q2 last year and 69.4% last quarter. The incremental improvement from Q1 reflects our strategy to increase our co-located data center capacity while leveraging the public cloud as needed. We expect gross margin for the rest of the year to be consistent with Q2. However, actual results may vary as gross margin is contingent upon the percentage of free users and the utilization of public cloud during the pandemic. R&D expense in Q2 was approximately $29 million, up 128% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D was approximately 4%, which was lower than Q2 last year, mainly due to the strong top line growth. In FY'21, we will continue to invest in R&D to drive innovation across all aspects of our platform. We also plan to diversify our engineering talent as reflected by our expansion in the U.S. and India. Sales and marketing expense for Q2 was $123 million. This reflects an increase of 78% or $54 million over last year with investments to drive future growth. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing was approximately 19%, a decrease from Q2 last year, due mainly to strong top line growth and marketing efficiencies from our increased global awareness. Overall, we plan to add sales capacity quickly over the next several quarters. The swift ramping of our sales organization to further capitalize on market opportunities is a priority. G&A expense in Q2 was $51 million, up 189% on a year-over-year basis due to higher accruals for telco taxes correlated to higher billings, professional services and additional hiring to meet the functions of a public company of this scale. As a percentage of total revenue, G&A expense was approximately 8%, a decrease from Q2 last year as we gained leverage on our investments with a rapid growth in revenue. The substantial revenue upside in the quarter carried over to the bottom line with non-GAAP operating income of $277 million, far exceeding our guidance, translating to a 41.7% non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter. This compares to Q2 last year's result of $21 million and 14.2% margin. The significant margin expansion year-over-year is due to the steep increase in revenue in Q2, which outpaced the rate of investment even as we added over 500 employees in Q2, a 20% increase from last quarter and a 53% growth year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q2 was $0.92 on approximately 297 million of non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding and adjusted for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.46 higher than the high end of our guidance and $0.84 higher than Q2 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $743 million, up 309% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $1.4 billion, up 209% from $458 million year-over-year. The increase in RPO is consistent with the strong demand and execution in the quarter. We expect to recognize approximately 72% or $1 billion of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 62% or $285 million in Q2 last year. This indicates a shift in our renewal seasonality, which was historically weighted towards Q2 and Q4 and has now shifted to Q1 due to the strength of last quarter's performance. As a reminder, we do not focus on calculated billings as a metric for our business. We have a diverse business that spans from enterprises to individuals. With the changing mix of our business, annual billing terms and the growing level of monthly billing terms, such calculations have become less meaningful, especially now that we have a full quarter of monthly billings making up a bigger part of our revenue. We ended Q2 with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. Similar to Q1, we had exceptional operating cash flow in Q2 of $401 million, up from $31 million in Q2 last year. Free cash flow was $373 million, up from $17 million in Q2 last year. The increase is attributable to strong collections from the large increase in top line growth and higher percentage of monthly contracts throughout the quarter. For the second-half of the fiscal year, we expect to increase capital expenditures for additional data center infrastructure. As a reminder, we will see the semi-annual cadence of net cash inflows from ESPP purchases to occur in Q3. Now turning to guidance, we are pleased to raise our outlook for FY'21 for both revenue and non-GAAP profitability. Although we remain optimistic on Zoom's outlook, please note that the impact and extent of the COVID-19 prices and its associated economic concerns remain largely unknown. Our higher outlook for FY'21 is based on our view of the current business environment. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $685 million to $690 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $225 million to $230 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.73 to $0.74 based on approximately 300 million shares outstanding. Before giving you the full-year outlook, let me provide some context on our assumptions. While better-than-expected churn was one of the drivers to our Q2 outperformance, we did experience a significantly higher level of overall churn in Q2 as compared to historical rates. As customers with 10 or fewer employees have increased to 36% of our revenue, we are assuming a higher rate of churn due to this mix shift. From an expense perspective, we continue to focus on investing for growth, targeting investments that are appropriate for our market opportunity and the size of the business that we have become. Looking ahead, we expect operating margins to decrease from the peak in Q2 over the balance of this year as our hiring and spending catch up was a much greater scale of our business. It is prudent to expect margins to normalize to lower levels over the next several quarters. For the full-year of FY'21, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.37 billion to $2.39 billion, which will be approximately 281% to 284% year-over-year growth. This implies that Q3 and Q4 revenue will be only modestly higher than Q2, indicating a decline in quarter-over-quarter growth. For the full-year of FY'21, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $730 million to $750 million. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.40 to $2.47 for the full-year FY'21 based on approximately 300 million shares outstanding. In closing, we executed well in the first-half of our fiscal year. With our commitment to delivering customer happiness, we believe we will grow to over $2 billion in total revenue this fiscal year, which will be a remarkable milestone considering our guidance was below $1 billion in revenue at the start of this fiscal year. We are proud of how our team continued to perform in support of our customers and global community. Thank you to the entire Zoom team. Before we move to our Q&A session, let me turn it back to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Hey, thank you, Kelly. By the way, I wanted to invite you all to our virtual Zoomtopia event on October 14 and 15 with too many cool features like video filter. We hope to see you all there at Zoomtopia. Now let me turn it back to Tom. Tom?\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Eric. And with that, let's open it up for questions. If you have not enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. [Operator Instructions] And Matt, please queue up the first question.\nOperator:\nA - Matt Caballero: First question is from Alex Zukin with RBC.\nAlex Zukin: Thank you. Thanks, Matt, and Eric, first, I want to say thank you from the analyst community and as a parent, as a husband. Yes, you've made a substantive difference in all our lives. So I guess the question I get most frequently, Eric, is most people are now staring at their Zoom screens probably more than watching any kind of content globally. So, outside of starting to show commercials in between your relevant Zoom calls, talk about the biggest opportunity for continued bookings growth, whether it's Zoom Phones, opening up to the APIs, monetizing consumers filters that you just showed, but can you tell us you know, the more -- the better you do this year, the harder it is for us to know and understand what's the durable growth rate, how do you comp this amazing spectacular performance. So I'll stop there. I could go on for a bit.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Alex, first of all, I surely appreciate for your continued support for many years. I think you're fully right. It looks like there are so many opportunities here and there, all kinds of use cases, right, my kids also use Zoom and telemedicine, telehealth. I think it's clearer to define now our top priority is to help people stay connected and make sure our service always up. Quickly, based on the customer feedback, add some features, and make sure when you have multiple meetings, you do not have a meeting fatigue, right? I think that's our top priority. So we would like you to maybe leave for the future for how to further monetize that. Again, that's not our top priority. We got to laser-focus on one thing, how to truly make a customer happy rather than stay negative, especially during this pandemic time.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect, and then maybe if I could squeeze one in for Kelly; Kelly, you talked about the differences in churn that you're experiencing from the new customer cohort that you onboarded through the pandemic, and we've talked previously about what your historical churn looked like for monthly customers, and we know, I think, a little bit about how it looked in guidance before. Can you level set at a high level, what did you experience with that cohort versus where it's been historically, and at a high-level, what are you assuming in your guidance for that churn, for that monthly cohort of new users?\nKelly Steckelberg: So, remember going all the way back to the S-1, we talked about that the monthly customers churn on average about 4% per month. Their monthly rate is about 4%, and we did see an increase against that in Q2, and we have modeled at that same level going forward with all the uncertainty with how long this pandemic will last and what other potential economic uncertainty there is, we've modeled at that same rate going forward.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: All right, great. Thanks and congratulations. Just wanted to get a sense of where you think you are kind of innings or percentage-wise on working with organizations that may have kind of adopted you in a department or adopted you in part of having multiple services, of displacing those solutions or kind of having a more full organization discussion as well as having a follow-up discussion as well of attacking on phone or rooms or webinar type services, and do you have the sales teams in place to just start having those conversations on broader organization and deployments?\nEric Yuan: Kelly, do you want to take it?\nKelly Steckelberg: Sure. So we continue to see growth in the period from both new customers as well as existing customers and tremendous opportunity with webinar, especially as well as Zoom Phone. We actually signed our largest Zoom Phone deal to date in Q2. So exciting to see that continued momentum. We also saw customers that were doubling one of them that quadrupled their existing deployment. So we are still in early stages, and when we look at penetration, like we look at it in the Global 2000, like there's a small percentage that have a significant spend with us, so there's tremendous opportunity still ahead, Meta. Meta, I'm sorry, you went back on mute.\nMeta Marshall: Oh, sorry. Just whether you have the kind of sales organization in place to kind of have that gather, or gather conversation?\nKelly Steckelberg: So, as I said earlier, we are hiring very quickly to keep up with all of the demand that's potential. The team, thank you to our amazing Zoom team, which are really working around the clock to keep up with the demand today and to support and serve our customers and the community, but we are hiring; absolutely. This is one of the biggest priorities for the rest of this year.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks and congrats.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America.\nNikolay Beliov: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to continue on the topic from the last question, Eric and Kelly, as the business grows at unprecedented rates, can you help us understand what's happening internally, your customer support organization, your sales organization, your ERP system, HCM system, onboarding like hyper growth scenarios, so many people and maybe putting pressure on the systems, and also culturally, what's happening inside the organization?\nEric Yuan: Yes. That's a great question. So, prior to pandemic crisis, we maintain a steady growth and make sure our internal systems, processes, procedures, everything is doing well, and however, due to this pandemic crisis, I think the business growth is just unprecedented. The good news, on the one hand, we had a very solid company culture. Nobody complained. We all worked very hard. Looked at are there any other holes in terms of procedure, process, and also we hired a lot of employees, double down our support resources and customer success management team, to further help because there's so many new use cases, new customers. That's why we hired lots of employees. On the other hand, we also wanted to leverage opportunities that could transform our business to next level. In terms of privacy, security and internal process and systems, I think, again, we are very committed, right? Every day, we work so hard, what kind of new issues, like even the free calls or online paid subscribers, when they try to come for service, we would like to respond in a timely manner. I am not saying, well, we are perfect, but we are very committed to really double down on our execution to make sure truly they're all happening to all the users.\nNikolay Beliov: And Eric, which use cases, new use cases you're most excited about and surprised you the most? That's it for me.\nEric Yuan: My golly, if I talk about new use cases, probably I can speak for four or five minutes. I'll give you several. Like you see the PropNex uses Zoom for their virtual property tour. During the last 10 weeks, they have closed over 50% of the newly launched properties in Singapore over Zoom, and also the CSK, first law firm in Florida to have virtual trial by jury, and also, like South Coast Community Services, which is largest mental health service provider in California also use Zoom to offer mental health being mental health is becoming a very big problem. A lot of new use cases like that. So every day, I feel very, very excited to see so many new use cases, not to mention, like we just announced the partnership with the United States Tennis Association to offer the virtual experience is very cool.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Taz Koujalgi with Guggenheim.\nTaz Koujalgi: Hey, guys, can you hear me? Can you guys hear me?\nTom McCallum: Yes, we hear you, Taz.\nTaz Koujalgi: A question for you, Eric, I think you mentioned that one of the customers that you signed this year was with ServiceNow and replace the legacy PBX system with Zoom, does that mean that you're offering video and phone to ServiceNow that they base all their collaboration tools with one product, Zoom?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So, you know, first of all, ServiceNow has been a customer since 2018. They deployed Zoom to replace other video conferencing, web conferencing service with Zoom video conferencing. Over the past several years, we already established a great trust. We also announced the partnership. When they looked at their entire usage rate, they also deployed legacy, very costly, very complex, on-prem PBX system, why not consolidate into one system with a very consistent product front end experience, same back end architecture and in terms of total costs, much lower, user experience also much better? So that's why they decided to replace their legacy PBX system with one safety, standardized on Zoom unified communication solution.\nTaz Koujalgi: That's very helpful. Just one follow-up, Kelly, I think you mentioned that you signed your largest phone deal this quarter. Was that also an upsell to an existing video customer, or was that a new customer who signed up with Zoom Phone?\nKelly Steckelberg: No, it was already a meetings customer as well, a video customer as well.\nTaz Koujalgi: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. So, now that the 90-day feature freeze is complete, Eric, I'm kind of curious, where is the focus of R&D going forward? And you mentioned diversifying into India and the U.S. How are you structurally changing your R&D effort? And is that in relation to any type of geopolitical pressure?\nEric Yuan: Yes. First of all -- and we accomplished a lot over the past 90 days, but I can tell you that we take privacy and security extremely seriously. I'm not seeing we are going to give any of that. I would say the journey just starts, right? We are going to double down on privacy and security, and inside that, we also have a big R&D team, and our core technology, engineered leadership team here in San Jose. We also have an offshore team. Look at a lot of new use cases not only for enterprise, but also the kids' education, K-12 schools and telemedicine, there are so many use cases. I think this R&D team, I do not think that is -- we can really handle that in terms of scalability. We have to find more talents in a timely manner, and that's why we opened up 2 R&D offices in Phoenix and in Pittsburgh, and also, we would -- we like this onshore/offshore R&D model. That's why India have also opened up a big office. We hired our President of Product and Engineering for China, right, great leader, right? With that, we really want to hire engineers and not only here, but also other site, also even including remote engineers, right, because there are so many features and tasks, and that's why I want to invite you to join our Zoomtopia, which is our annual user conference. We'd like to service you very good product road map.\nSterling Auty: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nMatt Caballero: The next question is from Richard Valera with Needham.\nRichard Valera: Thank you. Let me add my congratulations on another incredible quarter, team. So, the question is on pipeline. Kelly, you were sort of on the record saying that you entered Q2 with a bigger pipeline than you had entering Q1. I'm wondering if you could give any similar color on how you entered Q3 from a pipeline perspective and if there's been any change in the composition of that pipeline in terms of product or geography.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, certainly, coming into the quarter, our pipeline is still strong, and we're continuing to see demand, but based on our guidance, you can see that the demand for the year was front-end loaded, and we saw that in the performance in Q1, the benefit of which we saw in Q2, and that's why the guidance is highlighting that we expect revenue for the back half of the year to be effectively consistent with Q2.\nRichard Valera: Got it. Just in terms of the contribution of phone in the pipeline, has that changed much? Any color at all on how you're thinking about the magnitude of phone in the balance of the year?\nKelly Steckelberg: No, it's performing as we expected, and as I said, we're really excited to see our largest deal to date and ongoing upsell. So, really still can see strong demand for Zoom Phone, and we see a lot of potential there for the future.\nRichard Valera: Got it, thank you.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Tom Roderick with Stifel.\nTom Roderick: Great, thank you guys, great job on another outstanding quarter. Eric, this is going to kind of go in conjunction with the question on Zoom Phone and kind of was thinking about it as a unified communications platform, not just a communications tool for video. I'd love to hear about some of the strategic conversations you're having in the context of digital transformation and what else these customers want you to do, and if you can elaborate in there in conjunction with how your customers are thinking about your next game plan in security, that would be great.\nEric Yuan: Yes, that's a great question. So, I would say this pandemic crisis completely accelerated every enterprise, every business customer's digital transformation, because you want to support employees no matter where they are, right, where the traditional on-prem system really is not applicable anymore, right? That's why you look at all the cloud with these software service companies doing very well. With respect to Zoom Phone, I think, overall, that's a part of our video conferencing offering. We truly believe video is the new voice. There's no reason for any business to deploy two separate systems, totally different experience. Hindsight of that, when customers who still deploy on-prem, legacy PBX system, when they migrate to cloud, they want to understand who has the better architecture. They want to consolidate into one system. That's the reason why we're positioned very well, and some other SMB customers already deploy maybe some other cloud with the PBX systems, they also want to consolidate into one system to further solidify their experience. So, overall, we even do not think that's two separate markets. It is just one thing. Video conferencing and cloud-based PBX are converged into one service. So that's our story when we talk with customers. The customer really likes that.\nTom Roderick: And Kelly, a quick one for you in terms of the conversation around security, but as you've agreed to enable end-to-end security for not just paying customers but for all customers, which is a recent pronouncement, I think, what does that do to the cost structure? Is that meaningful? Will we have noticed that? Can you just talk about that a little bit?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. No, you won't see a meaningful impact. We certainly have been investing in both our security team. We're thrilled to have Jason Lee have joined us, and you'll continue to see some ongoing investments there, but it doesn't really have a meaningful impact on the margins.\nTom Roderick: Got it, thank you. Great job, appreciate it.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs, who's joined in by phone. [Operator Instructions]\nHeather Bellini: Great, yes. Yes, great, thank you so much, and congratulations, and I think as Alex started out by saying, Eric and team, just thank you for keeping everybody connected. We're so appreciative that school started today on Zoom. So my kids were app users today. For the question I had, was really just a little bit on Zoom Phone, and I know, Kelly, you've just answered a handful of questions, but Eric or Kelly, I'm just wondering if you could share with us how fast do you think you can see these kind of legacy phone systems. Like how fast do you think this work-from-home benefit can drive displacement of legacy PBXs, which we've all been waiting for, for quite a long time, and I know this is only sold to new customers, but you have so many of those -- or to existing customers, but you have so many of those at this point, and is there any kind of typical competition sphere that you're seeing as you're talking to customers and they're making the migration? Thank you so much.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Heather, that's a very great question. So I think prior to this pandemic crisis, if you look at enterprise, a very high percentage of customers is still deployed with the traditional on-prem legacy, costly PBX systems. However, I think this pandemic crisis, I think, is sort of like a wake-up call. You got to think about how to and focus, embrace digital transformation. Having cited that, in the cloud-based PBX, for sure, it's one of the things we've got to look into that. Another thing that's top priority as compared to the video conferencing, but for sure, it's on -- a lot of enterprise customers read that script. At the same time, I think they have a lot of other systems, not only for PBX, but also a lot of other systems. They also look at the cloud-based solution. I think this crisis just accelerated that migration from a traditional PBX and into the cloud-based system, and also Zoom is very well positioned. With a customer, they do not want to -- oh, I migrated to the cloud, and they also want to look at the new user experience, like a Zoom solution because this is the one existing. I think in the next 12 to 18 months, I would say you will see a little bit higher acceleration rate for enterprise customers to migrate to unified collaboration and communication solutions as Zoom. In terms of -- yes, just quickly in terms of competition, right, still the traditional legacy system and some other cloud-based PBX, but again, Zoom is much better positioned because we have one unified solution. Thank you, Heather.\nHeather Bellini: Thank you, again.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Will Power with Robert W. Baird.\nWill Power: Great, thank you. I want to ask a question on the rest of world strength. You saw a surge in activity there. Usage revenue obviously grew significantly as a percentage of the total. I wonder if you could speak to how broad-based that was. Were there any particular regions or countries that stood out? I know you talked a bit about India, and how do we think that progressing from here? Do you expect that to continue to grow as a percent of revenue? And what might that mean for the margin impact of the business, if any?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So, if you look at\u2026\nKelly Steckelberg: Go ahead, Eric.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Yes. So if you look at our free users or paid online subscriptions, right, it's coming almost everywhere. However, if you look at the number of visitors to our Web site, top countries like, for sure, U.S. obviously number one; and India number two; Japan number three; Canada, U.K. number four and number five. I think users are almost from every country, right? They try to use Zoom because it's very easy. It's free, and if 40 minutes are not enough, they would like to pay, and some SMB customers, they also try our webinar service, and also the enterprise customer might try the phone service. I think organic growth because of the brand awareness, I think, really helped us. So for now, we just say, no matter where the users come from, we would like to take a step back to see where we can do differently to serve them better in terms of having a local data center, like we just announced a data center in Singapore, and also that we double down our India presence, and we are going to have a team to capture the growth from international expansions. Kelly, sorry, feel free to chime in.\nKelly Steckelberg: No, that's okay. I was just going to say that the strength in the growth outside the world was really consistent between EMEA and APAC. So, we're very pleased with that, and overall, the market -- the pricing is adjusted for the market, so you shouldn't see significant impact on the long-term margins based on the structure that we have in place for our pricing today.\nWill Power: Great, thank you.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Rishi Jaluria with D.A. Davidson.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey, everyone. Thank you so much for taking my question, and I'll echo a truly outstanding quarter I think beyond what any of us could have imagined. I wanted to follow up a little bit on an earlier question, which is some of the moves in China, right? I mean stopped free trials, recently stopped direct sales there, at the same time, expanding R&D efforts in India and in the U.S. as well. Just what's kind of the impetus for this move? Is this a signal of kind of distancing a little bit away from China, maybe in response to geopolitical pressure? And then for Kelly, what sort of impact would this have from a model perspective, both on the top line and margins? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, we don't have any current plans to move our engineering talent out of China. We are focusing on diversifying it by adding talent in the U.S. and India. That's really the goal, and our leadership team is currently based in San Jose, so there's no change in that overall structure. For the long term, if there were -- something were to change, there would be no immediate impact on our service or our ability to provide services to our customers -- sorry, in the short term and the medium term. Over the long-term, there could be a potential impact on the margins as we would need to replace those talents 8somewhere else potentially.\nEric Yuan: Yes, just to add on to what Kelly said, revenue-wise is very small, no impact. Previously, if you look at almost every country, we have online subscription. We have a direct sales out of China, but in China, the overall revenue were small, the online subscription, you need to have a special license, we already sold that before. So we would like to simplify our go-to-market because actually the support and sales associates, a lot of resources, right, why not simplify that just to leverage our third-party partners with a white labeling solution. I think that that's very sustainable and is good from our side.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thank you, Kelly and Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.\nPhil Winslow: Hey, thanks guys for taking my question, and congratulations on another phenomenal quarter. I wanted to talk about converting monthly users to annual users; Kelly, that was one of the things you talked about on the last call. I wonder if you can give us an update on sort of what you saw from the, call it, the Q1 cohort during Q2 in terms of your ability to convert those, and how should we think about any sort of the promotions, sort of initiatives changing going forward? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, of course. So, our marketing team is really focused on this, running campaigns and reaching out to these customers to provide them the opportunity to convert from monthly to annual, and we were happy with the success that we saw in Q2 and are continuing to focus on this, and we've also made some changes to our online buy flow to make it easier for the customers as well to self-serve and upgrade if they're so inclined. So, we expect to see this to continue to be a focus for us as we move through Q3.\nPhil Winslow: Got it, thanks.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yes, thank you very much. A question for Kelly, you're guiding revenue to be up around 3% sequentially, but if I assume that your customer count is at least flattish Q-to-Q, your average customer count is going to be up around 16% Q-to-Q, which implies that your ARPU is implicitly guided to be down 13% Q-to-Q, and so my question is I've never seen a double-digit decline in your ARPU before, what would drive that?\nKelly Steckelberg: Well, as we're sitting here right now, looking forward, I think it's more around the uncertainty around churn and what's going to happen with the overall economy. That's really the uncertainty there and why we're guiding flat for Q3 to -- Q3 and Q4 revenue will be flat, modestly up from Q2, and we've had a significant increase in our mass market customers, where there just remains limited visibility in terms of the long-term contribution for those customers. So, I don't think that we necessarily expect that dramatic increase in ARPU that you're pointing out. It's more around the uncertainty in churn and what does that mean for the top line growth.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay, thank you.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Brad Zelnick with Credit Suisse.\nBrad Zelnick: Great. Thank you so much, and I echo my congratulations and gratitude all around, and it's nice to see everybody. My question is for Eric. Eric, from a product perspective, how might Zoom in the future be able to go deeper into the context in which communications is happening? I'm thinking about human behavior or human intent, for example, to help make the experience even more valuable.\nEric Yuan: Yes. That's a great question. That's why please join our Zoomtopia. I think, first of all, you're absolutely right. Zoom is not only a communications tool, go deep, right, because our mission is to develop a better service, better online video conferencing service, even better than face-to-face meeting, how to lever AI functionality, like not only have you the meeting transcription, but also how to analyze that in a timely manner. Let's say, if you change a topic, give you a quick reminder, hey, please slow down, right? So, based on face detection or something like that, all those AI features, and for us, look at it in the long run, right, language translation real time, and also how to shake hand remotely, a lot of cool features like that, and in the past, you look at the inflow of video and perspective, right, how to add some of the fun features like video filter and how to make the 3D video, leverage AR. I think a lot of technologies, right, not to mention 5G and in the future, I think that if you look at the future, a lot of those good technologies can truly make the video conferencing experience much better.\nBrad Zelnick: Thank you so much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you. Please join us on -- at Zoomtopia. Thank you.\nBrad Zelnick: I wouldn't miss it.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Ryan Koontz with Rosenblatt Securities.\nRyan Koontz: Hi, great, thanks for the question. With regards to the sales and marketing investment, it came in a little light there, and obviously, have a really strong customer pull for the product. How are you thinking about your go-to-market motion, how you might change your sales strategy relative to your prolific success to date, and are you looking at reseller channels or other technology platform partners to take you to market into the enterprise? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: So the decline in sales and marketing was partly due to just the strong top line performance as well as efficiencies that we're seeing in marketing. When we expect that as a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing to increase through the back half of the year, as we're really focused on continuing to hire globally, we did -- if you remember, we announced the master agent program for Zoom Phone in Q2 and are really excited about that program and expect it to go -- continue to contribute more significantly as we move through the year, and on the meeting side, continuing our mostly direct model, which has been very successful for us to date.\nEric Yuan: So, just to briefly add on to what Kelly said, if you look at the marketing efficiency, you look at our marketplace, we already have more than 700 third-party applications. That's another way for us, right, to promote our brand awareness, right? More and more integrations certainly can help our marketing efficiency.\nRyan Koontz: Okay, thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nMatt Caballero: The next question is from Bhavan Suri with William Blair.\nBhavan Suri: Great, thanks for taking my questions, and congrats, I guess I want to touch on something a little more probably high level and strategic. Obviously asked you in the past about the convergence and where does Slack and collaboration fit in. So, let's turn this a little bit differently. You're going to host Zoomtopia, and this whole event planning space is a huge market, and it feels like it would be an obvious fit for you, and you have partners there, but the natural extension of this into events and meeting seems to make a lot of sense. How do you think about that market, and then do you think about sort of maybe using the stock as a way to buy, but you could also build. I mean Kelly has got it to R&D coming up. You've got a lot of points between 40 and 30 to spend on R&D, and not all it is going to go to support the existing platform. So just some sense on the event space, how you think about it. Is that a build versus buy decision or a partner decision? Thank you.\nEric Yuan: First of all, I think you have a great question. So you have our vision right down. It looks like you have some great ideas. Actually, maybe after the call, I'd like to connect you with our product managers. I think you're absolutely right. If you look at our Zoomtopia, right, not only do we have webinar, but also we need to look at our entire online event management experience, right? It's not only to the real-time part, pre event and planning and marketing and promotion, marketing content and materials, every event, right, a lot of, I think, the content, right? I think having cited that, I think we believe this service has a strategic value to help further expand our webinar reach. Having cited that, I think in terms of sort of we do that everything by ourselves or bring a partner, maybe acquire somebody, I think it's too early to tell, but strategy-wise, you're absolutely right. That's got to be our focus, our priority. It's low-hanging fruits, right?\nBhavan Suri: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citi.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi, thanks. I'm curious this quarter just as it related to the really strong new customer adds and the revenue that came from that channel. Are you seeing an uptick in customers that are coming in through sort of displacements that had maybe not an older-generation solution but had tried something in the last three to six months and weren't happy with it and has switched over?\nEric Yuan: Kelly, do you want to take it?\nKelly Steckelberg: I don't think that we saw as much of that. I mean it's definitely -- customers have been using something. I think that what has happened over the last 4 to 5 months is people have realized that the solution they had in place just wasn't up for -- up to the strength of what it needed to be in this pandemic, and so, we've continued to see amazing brands move over from some of the competitors as they're really looking for something to ensure that they can keep their employees really effectively [technical difficulty] keeping them safe as well, and then, of course, we're super excited about some of the school districts that we've seen sign up. We have the top two school districts in the U.S. as our customers today. So that really highlights the scalability of the platform and then wanting to ensure that they have a really reliable solution as they went back to school.\nWalter Pritchard: And then when do you think you can give phone customer count, any horizon on that?\nKelly Steckelberg: That's one of the things we're considering, Walter, that we'll talk about. We've said that for Zoom Phone, we'll give milestone updates. We'll look at it at Zoomtopia and see if that makes sense. The last update we gave was actually at the anniversary date of Zoom Phone, so we might wait until then.\nWalter Pritchard: Okay, thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Matthew VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question, a great quarter there. You talked a little bit about channel partners still remains a fairly low portion of your overall sales, but curious what the uptake is in total partners registering as part of the program. Is it something that you're proactively doing? Or is it just the demand for the product sort of pulling them in? And then on sort of a related note from an international market perspective, do you feel like you can hire aggressively enough from a sales head count internationally? Or do you need to look at partnerships in specific markets that could be smaller growth areas, but growth areas nonetheless?\nKelly Steckelberg: So, from the hiring side, we definitely believe we can hire everything that we need internationally. We've really invested in our talent acquisition team and are doing that on a broad base around the globe to ensure that we are able to hire as quickly as possible. As you know, there's a little bit of a longer lead time for notice periods internationally, but we're hiring as quickly as we can, and then in terms of the uptick kind of the partners in the channel, we don't give out those specifics, but we are continuously looking at our channel programs to ensure that they are not only competitive but driving the results that we want. So it's something we evaluate on a constant basis.\nMatthew VanVliet: Okay, thank you.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Quinton Gabrielli with Piper Sandler.\nQuinton Gabrielli: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a great quarter. Really just one quick question from our end, obviously, you guys saw some really strong enterprise traction for Q2. Just wondering if we could get some idea of the percentage of revenues from enterprise customers compared to the 23% we saw in the last quarter. Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: We are sharing that the revenue -- we don't call out specifically customers, but we -- I'm sorry, enterprise customers, but that the revenue from effectively customers with fewer than 10 was 20% in Q2, which is consistent with previous quarters in that same range.\nQuinton Gabrielli: Got it, all right, thank you.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Ittai? Okay, we'll come back. Our next question is from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc.\nAlex Kurtz: Yes, thanks for taking the question. Actually, someone at Zoom did a good job because we just switched our school district from Google meeting over to Zoom for the start of the fall semester. So someone deserves a raise. So, Kelly, as you think about OpEx trending into next fiscal year, I know you don't -- aren't going to talk explicitly to it yet, but a lot of churn to assume, especially in that Q1 of next year, and you have a lot of investments that you're making as far as R&D and sales and marketing. So as we're working through our models and looking into OpEx levels from Q4 to Q1, how should we be -- what's the framework for that?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, you should expect the operating margins to decrease incrementally each quarter going forward as we are continuing to, as you said, invest in R&D and invest more in our sales and marketing teams as well and getting towards that longer-term margin that we've talked about historically. We're going to talk in more detail around this at Analyst Day, but the last time we updated you on this, we still said that our long-term margins were around 20%. So I think you should assume we're getting more in that range, nearer to that than the 41.7%.\nAlex Kurtz: Okay.\nEric Yuan: Alex, by the way, if your kid's school district had any questions or any feedback to Zoom, please let them know you know Zoom's CEO and can be there.\nAlex Kurtz: I will send them right to you, Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Alex.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Ryan MacWilliams with Stephens.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks, guys for the question. So, for Zoom Phone, pretty unbelievable rate of achieving global service coverage, so congrats on the expansion there; Kelly, when you mentioned doubling or tripling the Zoom Phone seats and various deployments, is that a part of this expanding global service coverage, and have you seen more enterprises trialing Zoom Phone as a result of this additional coverage? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: All right. So, certainly, international expansion, I think we've said historically, that was the biggest opportunity for us, and I think a perfect example of that is the 2 largest Zoom Phone deals in Q2 were outside the U.S. So that really shows the strength and what the international coverage is bringing to Zoom Phone, and sorry, what was the other one -- oh, enterprise customers trialing Zoom. Yes, absolutely. There are some amazing names that we can't talk about yet, but we're excited about the traction that we're seeing in the enterprise customer base as well.\nRyan MacWilliams: Best of luck. Thanks, guys.\nMatt Caballero: Our next question is from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities.\nPat Walravens: Oh, great, thank you. If she comes in on time, I'm going to give you some real feedback from one of your customers. Here she is.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hello.\nPat Walravens: Okay. [Gigi], [ph] what -- so Gigi's school also just switched from Google to Zoom, and Gigi, what is it that you like best about Zoom?\nUnidentified Analyst: The breakout rooms, I thought they were really convenient because my teacher -- we have a lot of students in our cohort, our group, and it's really hard for all of us to talk at once. So she put us in 6 breakout rooms, and I have 4 or 5 students with me, and it's really nice to talk to them, to work with them, check answers instead of having 40 kids, like wide, huge group, and you can never get to talk. That's why I love breakout rooms so much, and I think it's really convenient.\nPat Walravens: Thank you, Gigi.\nKelly Steckelberg: Great, thanks for the feedback, Gigi.\nPat Walravens: So, my question is, so Eric, when everyone's working from home, how do you make where you work an attractive place to work?\nEric Yuan: Well, first of all, your daughter Gigi's comments made my day today. I would like to talk to her. So speaking workplace, I think for now, I think for the foreseeable future, we all need to work from home, but we've got to think about the long-term planning. So, meaning, after the pandemic crisis is over, what the new workplace look like. We talk with many customers, partners. We believe, in terms of the working from home, this trend will stay. I'm not saying all of us will keep working from home. It's very, very likely it's a hybrid, meaning twice a week or three days a week, you can send all employees back at home, and some other time, we all keep working in the office, and also you can further consolidate a lot of the small offices, right? You do not need to have offices everywhere anymore. You also can hire talent almost everywhere, and for us, even for the workplace today, if you look at a lot of the companies, it is a very big open space. I think that may not work anymore in the future. Good news, we do have target for the next 10, maybe 12 months, we can optimize what the future workplace look like, but again, no matter what, I think tools like this continue can help.\nPat Walravens: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nMatt Caballero: And we have time for one more question, and the last question is from Jonathan Kees with Summit Insights Group.\nJonathan Kees: Great, guys, you snuck me here. I add my congratulations to the quarter. So I guess I have my one question as well as, if I can, a clarification. The clarification first, maybe it's more for Kelly. Kelly, you had said last quarter, you were modeling in the assumption that your sales teams would start being more a moderate or more normalized level of business activity. I didn't -- I noticed that wasn't in the guidance in the commentary this quarter. Is that still the case then that carried over from last quarter? That's a clarification, and then my real question is can you tell me about the discounting, on the pricing that you have for the enterprise RFPs? Are you seeing a lot of that? Are you seeing a good amount of that? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, in terms of our sales rep productivity, as you can imagine, it was an extreme high level in Q1 and also extremely elevated in Q2. As we look forward to Q3 and Q4, we have modeled it certainly to be lower than that but still higher than what we saw last year. So, it's kind of somewhere in between what we saw for the first-half of this year but where it was exiting FY'20, and then in terms of enterprise discounting, we don't disclose specifics around that, but we haven't really seen a significant change in the buying patterns of our enterprise customers.\nJonathan Kees: Great. Keep up the good work. Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you.\nMatt Caballero: Okay. That wraps up our Q&A.\nTom McCallum: Great, and I think we'll turn it over to Eric for any final comments. Eric?\nEric Yuan: Is Ittai still available? It looks like he has a question, right? No?\nMatt Caballero: No, I don't think Ittai is going to be asking a question today.\nEric Yuan: Yes. So, thank you all for joining us today, and we're truly appreciative for your time. It has been a memorable first-half to our investors and analysts. We appreciate your continued support for Zoom. Thank you all. See you next quarter. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Bye. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you everybody.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. Q2 was a remarkable quarter for Zoom as we continued to rapidly grow and invest in our business to meet the demands of our customers and communities. Let me start by reviewing our financial results for Q2, then discuss our outlook for Q3 and the increased view of our full-year FY'21. Total revenue grew 355% year-over-year to $664 million in Q2. This top line results significantly exceeded the high end of our guidance range of $500 million as demand remained at heightened levels, combined with lower-than-expected churn and exceptional sales execution. For the quarter, the year-over-year growth in revenue was primarily due to subscription provided to new customers, which accounted for approximately 81% of the increase, while subscriptions provided to existing customers accounted for approximately 19% of the increase. This demand was broad-based across industry verticals, geographies and customer cohorts. Let's take a look at the key customer metrics for Q2. We continue to see expansion in the upmarket as we ended Q2 at 988 customers generating more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue, up 112% year-over-year. This is an increase of 219 customers over Q1, the highest number of adds in a quarter. We exited the quarter with a total of approximately 370,000 customers with more than 10 employees. We added approximately 105,000 of these customers in Q2, the second highest number of adds in any quarter. Year-over-year, we added approximately 304,000 new customers with more than 10 employees for 458% growth. We have continued to benefit from significant growth in our customer segment with 10 or fewer employees as small businesses and individuals adopted and maintained their Zoom licenses for various uses during the pandemic. In Q2, customers with 10 or fewer employees represented 36% of revenue, up from 30% in Q1 and 20% in Q4 of last year. The increase in customers with 10 or fewer employees continues to shift our billing mix as these customers generally pay monthly rather than annually as do most enterprise customers. This shift is an important point for our outlook, which I will discuss in just a moment. Our net dollar expansion for customers with more than 10 employees was over 130% for the ninth consecutive quarter as existing customers continue to support and trust Zoom to be their video communications platform of choice. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Americas grew at a rate of 288% year-over-year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue accelerated to 629% year-over-year and represented approximately 31% of revenue. We will continue to invest in international expansion to capitalize on our brand awareness and the increased global opportunity. Now turning to profitability, the increase in demand and strong execution drove net income profitability from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock and acquisition-related expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin in the second quarter was 72.3% compared to 82.2% in Q2 last year and 69.4% last quarter. The incremental improvement from Q1 reflects our strategy to increase our co-located data center capacity while leveraging the public cloud as needed. We expect gross margin for the rest of the year to be consistent with Q2. However, actual results may vary as gross margin is contingent upon the percentage of free users and the utilization of public cloud during the pandemic. R&D expense in Q2 was approximately $29 million, up 128% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D was approximately 4%, which was lower than Q2 last year, mainly due to the strong top line growth. In FY'21, we will continue to invest in R&D to drive innovation across all aspects of our platform. We also plan to diversify our engineering talent as reflected by our expansion in the U.S. and India. Sales and marketing expense for Q2 was $123 million. This reflects an increase of 78% or $54 million over last year with investments to drive future growth. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing was approximately 19%, a decrease from Q2 last year, due mainly to strong top line growth and marketing efficiencies from our increased global awareness. Overall, we plan to add sales capacity quickly over the next several quarters. The swift ramping of our sales organization to further capitalize on market opportunities is a priority. G&A expense in Q2 was $51 million, up 189% on a year-over-year basis due to higher accruals for telco taxes correlated to higher billings, professional services and additional hiring to meet the functions of a public company of this scale. As a percentage of total revenue, G&A expense was approximately 8%, a decrease from Q2 last year as we gained leverage on our investments with a rapid growth in revenue. The substantial revenue upside in the quarter carried over to the bottom line with non-GAAP operating income of $277 million, far exceeding our guidance, translating to a 41.7% non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter. This compares to Q2 last year's result of $21 million and 14.2% margin. The significant margin expansion year-over-year is due to the steep increase in revenue in Q2, which outpaced the rate of investment even as we added over 500 employees in Q2, a 20% increase from last quarter and a 53% growth year-over-year. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q2 was $0.92 on approximately 297 million of non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding and adjusted for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.46 higher than the high end of our guidance and $0.84 higher than Q2 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $743 million, up 309% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $1.4 billion, up 209% from $458 million year-over-year. The increase in RPO is consistent with the strong demand and execution in the quarter. We expect to recognize approximately 72% or $1 billion of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 62% or $285 million in Q2 last year. This indicates a shift in our renewal seasonality, which was historically weighted towards Q2 and Q4 and has now shifted to Q1 due to the strength of last quarter's performance. As a reminder, we do not focus on calculated billings as a metric for our business. We have a diverse business that spans from enterprises to individuals. With the changing mix of our business, annual billing terms and the growing level of monthly billing terms, such calculations have become less meaningful, especially now that we have a full quarter of monthly billings making up a bigger part of our revenue. We ended Q2 with approximately $1.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. Similar to Q1, we had exceptional operating cash flow in Q2 of $401 million, up from $31 million in Q2 last year. Free cash flow was $373 million, up from $17 million in Q2 last year. The increase is attributable to strong collections from the large increase in top line growth and higher percentage of monthly contracts throughout the quarter. For the second-half of the fiscal year, we expect to increase capital expenditures for additional data center infrastructure. As a reminder, we will see the semi-annual cadence of net cash inflows from ESPP purchases to occur in Q3. Now turning to guidance, we are pleased to raise our outlook for FY'21 for both revenue and non-GAAP profitability. Although we remain optimistic on Zoom's outlook, please note that the impact and extent of the COVID-19 prices and its associated economic concerns remain largely unknown. Our higher outlook for FY'21 is based on our view of the current business environment. For the third quarter, we expect revenue in the range of $685 million to $690 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $225 million to $230 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.73 to $0.74 based on approximately 300 million shares outstanding. Before giving you the full-year outlook, let me provide some context on our assumptions. While better-than-expected churn was one of the drivers to our Q2 outperformance, we did experience a significantly higher level of overall churn in Q2 as compared to historical rates. As customers with 10 or fewer employees have increased to 36% of our revenue, we are assuming a higher rate of churn due to this mix shift. From an expense perspective, we continue to focus on investing for growth, targeting investments that are appropriate for our market opportunity and the size of the business that we have become. Looking ahead, we expect operating margins to decrease from the peak in Q2 over the balance of this year as our hiring and spending catch up was a much greater scale of our business. It is prudent to expect margins to normalize to lower levels over the next several quarters. For the full-year of FY'21, we expect revenue to be in the range of $2.37 billion to $2.39 billion, which will be approximately 281% to 284% year-over-year growth. This implies that Q3 and Q4 revenue will be only modestly higher than Q2, indicating a decline in quarter-over-quarter growth. For the full-year of FY'21, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $730 million to $750 million. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.40 to $2.47 for the full-year FY'21 based on approximately 300 million shares outstanding. In closing, we executed well in the first-half of our fiscal year. With our commitment to delivering customer happiness, we believe we will grow to over $2 billion in total revenue this fiscal year, which will be a remarkable milestone considering our guidance was below $1 billion in revenue at the start of this fiscal year. We are proud of how our team continued to perform in support of our customers and global community. Thank you to the entire Zoom team. Before we move to our Q&A session, let me turn it back to Eric. So, remember going all the way back to the S-1, we talked about that the monthly customers churn on average about 4% per month. Their monthly rate is about 4%, and we did see an increase against that in Q2, and we have modeled at that same level going forward with all the uncertainty with how long this pandemic will last and what other potential economic uncertainty there is, we've modeled at that same rate going forward. Sure. So we continue to see growth in the period from both new customers as well as existing customers and tremendous opportunity with webinar, especially as well as Zoom Phone. We actually signed our largest Zoom Phone deal to date in Q2. So exciting to see that continued momentum. We also saw customers that were doubling one of them that quadrupled their existing deployment. So we are still in early stages, and when we look at penetration, like we look at it in the Global 2000, like there's a small percentage that have a significant spend with us, so there's tremendous opportunity still ahead, Meta. Meta, I'm sorry, you went back on mute. So, as I said earlier, we are hiring very quickly to keep up with all of the demand that's potential. The team, thank you to our amazing Zoom team, which are really working around the clock to keep up with the demand today and to support and serve our customers and the community, but we are hiring; absolutely. This is one of the biggest priorities for the rest of this year. No, it was already a meetings customer as well, a video customer as well. So, certainly, coming into the quarter, our pipeline is still strong, and we're continuing to see demand, but based on our guidance, you can see that the demand for the year was front-end loaded, and we saw that in the performance in Q1, the benefit of which we saw in Q2, and that's why the guidance is highlighting that we expect revenue for the back half of the year to be effectively consistent with Q2. No, it's performing as we expected, and as I said, we're really excited to see our largest deal to date and ongoing upsell. So, really still can see strong demand for Zoom Phone, and we see a lot of potential there for the future. Yes. No, you won't see a meaningful impact. We certainly have been investing in both our security team. We're thrilled to have Jason Lee have joined us, and you'll continue to see some ongoing investments there, but it doesn't really have a meaningful impact on the margins. Thank you. Go ahead, Eric. No, that's okay. I was just going to say that the strength in the growth outside the world was really consistent between EMEA and APAC. So, we're very pleased with that, and overall, the market -- the pricing is adjusted for the market, so you shouldn't see significant impact on the long-term margins based on the structure that we have in place for our pricing today. Yes. So, we don't have any current plans to move our engineering talent out of China. We are focusing on diversifying it by adding talent in the U.S. and India. That's really the goal, and our leadership team is currently based in San Jose, so there's no change in that overall structure. For the long term, if there were -- something were to change, there would be no immediate impact on our service or our ability to provide services to our customers -- sorry, in the short term and the medium term. Over the long-term, there could be a potential impact on the margins as we would need to replace those talents 8somewhere else potentially. Yes, of course. So, our marketing team is really focused on this, running campaigns and reaching out to these customers to provide them the opportunity to convert from monthly to annual, and we were happy with the success that we saw in Q2 and are continuing to focus on this, and we've also made some changes to our online buy flow to make it easier for the customers as well to self-serve and upgrade if they're so inclined. So, we expect to see this to continue to be a focus for us as we move through Q3. Well, as we're sitting here right now, looking forward, I think it's more around the uncertainty around churn and what's going to happen with the overall economy. That's really the uncertainty there and why we're guiding flat for Q3 to -- Q3 and Q4 revenue will be flat, modestly up from Q2, and we've had a significant increase in our mass market customers, where there just remains limited visibility in terms of the long-term contribution for those customers. So, I don't think that we necessarily expect that dramatic increase in ARPU that you're pointing out. It's more around the uncertainty in churn and what does that mean for the top line growth. So the decline in sales and marketing was partly due to just the strong top line performance as well as efficiencies that we're seeing in marketing. When we expect that as a percentage of revenue, sales and marketing to increase through the back half of the year, as we're really focused on continuing to hire globally, we did -- if you remember, we announced the master agent program for Zoom Phone in Q2 and are really excited about that program and expect it to go -- continue to contribute more significantly as we move through the year, and on the meeting side, continuing our mostly direct model, which has been very successful for us to date. I don't think that we saw as much of that. I mean it's definitely -- customers have been using something. I think that what has happened over the last 4 to 5 months is people have realized that the solution they had in place just wasn't up for -- up to the strength of what it needed to be in this pandemic, and so, we've continued to see amazing brands move over from some of the competitors as they're really looking for something to ensure that they can keep their employees really effectively [technical difficulty] keeping them safe as well, and then, of course, we're super excited about some of the school districts that we've seen sign up. We have the top two school districts in the U.S. as our customers today. So that really highlights the scalability of the platform and then wanting to ensure that they have a really reliable solution as they went back to school. That's one of the things we're considering, Walter, that we'll talk about. We've said that for Zoom Phone, we'll give milestone updates. We'll look at it at Zoomtopia and see if that makes sense. The last update we gave was actually at the anniversary date of Zoom Phone, so we might wait until then. Thank you. So, from the hiring side, we definitely believe we can hire everything that we need internationally. We've really invested in our talent acquisition team and are doing that on a broad base around the globe to ensure that we are able to hire as quickly as possible. As you know, there's a little bit of a longer lead time for notice periods internationally, but we're hiring as quickly as we can, and then in terms of the uptick kind of the partners in the channel, we don't give out those specifics, but we are continuously looking at our channel programs to ensure that they are not only competitive but driving the results that we want. So it's something we evaluate on a constant basis. We are sharing that the revenue -- we don't call out specifically customers, but we -- I'm sorry, enterprise customers, but that the revenue from effectively customers with fewer than 10 was 20% in Q2, which is consistent with previous quarters in that same range. Yes. So, you should expect the operating margins to decrease incrementally each quarter going forward as we are continuing to, as you said, invest in R&D and invest more in our sales and marketing teams as well and getting towards that longer-term margin that we've talked about historically. We're going to talk in more detail around this at Analyst Day, but the last time we updated you on this, we still said that our long-term margins were around 20%. So I think you should assume we're getting more in that range, nearer to that than the 41.7%. All right. So, certainly, international expansion, I think we've said historically, that was the biggest opportunity for us, and I think a perfect example of that is the 2 largest Zoom Phone deals in Q2 were outside the U.S. So that really shows the strength and what the international coverage is bringing to Zoom Phone, and sorry, what was the other one -- oh, enterprise customers trialing Zoom. Yes, absolutely. There are some amazing names that we can't talk about yet, but we're excited about the traction that we're seeing in the enterprise customer base as well. Great, thanks for the feedback, Gigi. So, in terms of our sales rep productivity, as you can imagine, it was an extreme high level in Q1 and also extremely elevated in Q2. As we look forward to Q3 and Q4, we have modeled it certainly to be lower than that but still higher than what we saw last year. So, it's kind of somewhere in between what we saw for the first-half of this year but where it was exiting FY'20, and then in terms of enterprise discounting, we don't disclose specifics around that, but we haven't really seen a significant change in the buying patterns of our enterprise customers. Thank you. Bye. Thank you."

            "name": "Eric Yuan",
            "content": "Hey, Tom, thank you. Hello. I hope you are all doing well. I want to thank our customers, investors and community for their support of Zoom. Their care, feedback and trust of Zoom make a huge difference, and we grew our business from being a start-up to a [non start-up] [ph] public company to be a long-term sustainable company. We might be facing all kinds of challenges, but no matter how busy we are, no matter what challenges we are facing, we are always recharged when we think about our customers' support and become even more motivated to serve them better. With the pandemic persisting, we are very committed to work hard and are humbled by our role of enabling communications worldwide during this challenging time. As remote work trends have accelerated during the pandemic, organizations have moved beyond addressing immediate business continuity needs to actively redefining and embracing new approaches to support a future of working anywhere, learning anywhere and connecting anywhere, and we continued to see meaningful adoption of Zoom's video-first unified communication platform across industries and geographies. So, let me share with you just a few key metrics that reflect this. Revenue grew 355% year-over-year in Q2. Customers with more than 10 employees grew 458% year-over-year as new customers chose Zoom to be their preferred communication and collaboration solutions, and we had over 35,000 educators, school administrators, and IT professionals from around the world join our free virtual Zoom Summer Academy. The successful two-day Zoom event was our biggest educational event to date, bringing together thought leadership in remote learning, practical training and networking opportunities, and we remain committed to helping our education customers, including the more than 100,000 K-12 schools who have signed up to use the platform for free during the pandemic. Moving on to a few recent business highlights. We completed our 90-day plan on security and privacy. A comprehensive summary of accomplishment is available on our Web site. I'm very proud of our team's swift and transparent response as well as the resulting improvements we made to our platform. Although the 90-day initiative is over, security and privacy matters will remain an important part of Zoom's strategy and DNA moving forward as we strive to maintain our customers' and other stakeholders' trust. We also made two exciting hardware announcement in the quarter. First is the launch of Zoom Hardware as a Service, which offers customers a variety of subscription opportunities for phone and meeting room hardware from leading hardware manufacturers. This offering makes Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms more accessible by minimizing friction around hardware procurement. Second is Zoom for Home, our new innovative category of software experience and hardware device partnerships to support remote work use cases. We launched this program with our partner DTEN in July, and this month, we announced its expansion to Amazon, Facebook and Google devices. We also achieved significant accomplishments for Zoom Phone. In mid-June, Zoom Phone was authorized under the FedRAMP, enabling federal agencies to consolidate their costly, legacy telephony systems onto our unified modern cloud solutions. This month, we expanded the availability of Zoom Phone service to 25 additional countries and territories. Zoom now provides local telephone service and domestic calling in more than 40 countries and territories. On a final note, we welcome our new CISO, Jason Lee, former SVP of Security Operations at Salesforce, and our new General Counsel, Jeff True, former EVP and General Counsel at Palo Alto Networks. We are very excited to have them. Now let's talk about some exciting wins in the quarter. Let me start with a couple of new customers that represent some of the largest companies in their industry. First, we are thrilled to welcome ExxonMobil, one of the largest publicly traded international energy companies, to the Zoom family. ExxonMobil develops and applies next-generation technologies to help safely and responsibly meet the world's growing needs for energy and chemical products. They recently used their scale and capabilities to ramp up production to make medical-grade masks, shields and hand sanitizers. We are grateful that ExxonMobil chose Zoom as their unified communications platform. ExxonMobil wanted a solution that would enable them to collaborate reliably and securely with their teams, customers and partners around the world. ExxonMobil employees are now using Zoom video communications across their global business. Second, Activision Blizzard, a member of the Fortune 500, had chosen Zoom to modernize and consolidate onto a single communication platform across their business units and gaming franchises. As a leading interactive entertainment company, connecting and engaging the world through epic entertainment, Activision committed to a full enterprise rollout of Zoom Meeting and Zoom Rooms to increase their mix of legacy video conferencing products. Our ability to expand with existing customers also helped drive our results this quarter. One of the highlights this quarter was the expansion with ServiceNow, who has been a Zoom customer since 2018, using Zoom Meetings for its 11,000 global employees. Since the global pandemic, ServiceNow employees working from home have relied heavily on Zoom's easy-to-use interface to stay productive and connected with our customers. As the Zoom platform has become a core piece of ServiceNow's technology ecosystem, this past quarter, the company chose to replace its legacy hardware PBX system with Zoom Phone across their organization, further elevating their teams' work-anywhere experience with seamless, one-touch communication and collaboration. Thank you, ExxonMobil, Activision Blizzard, ServiceNow and all our wonderful customers for trusting Zoom. I love you. All Zoom employees love you. Thank you. In summary, we continued to scale and expand our business to meet the need of our customers and the global community. I'm very proud of our achievements and thank our more than 3,400 employees for another exceptional quarter. Let's remain focused on delivering happiness to our customers and community. With that, let me turn things over to Kelly. Hey, thank you, Kelly. By the way, I wanted to invite you all to our virtual Zoomtopia event on October 14 and 15 with too many cool features like video filter. We hope to see you all there at Zoomtopia. Now let me turn it back to Tom. Tom? Yes. Alex, first of all, I surely appreciate for your continued support for many years. I think you're fully right. It looks like there are so many opportunities here and there, all kinds of use cases, right, my kids also use Zoom and telemedicine, telehealth. I think it's clearer to define now our top priority is to help people stay connected and make sure our service always up. Quickly, based on the customer feedback, add some features, and make sure when you have multiple meetings, you do not have a meeting fatigue, right? I think that's our top priority. So we would like you to maybe leave for the future for how to further monetize that. Again, that's not our top priority. We got to laser-focus on one thing, how to truly make a customer happy rather than stay negative, especially during this pandemic time. Kelly, do you want to take it? Yes. That's a great question. So, prior to pandemic crisis, we maintain a steady growth and make sure our internal systems, processes, procedures, everything is doing well, and however, due to this pandemic crisis, I think the business growth is just unprecedented. The good news, on the one hand, we had a very solid company culture. Nobody complained. We all worked very hard. Looked at are there any other holes in terms of procedure, process, and also we hired a lot of employees, double down our support resources and customer success management team, to further help because there's so many new use cases, new customers. That's why we hired lots of employees. On the other hand, we also wanted to leverage opportunities that could transform our business to next level. In terms of privacy, security and internal process and systems, I think, again, we are very committed, right? Every day, we work so hard, what kind of new issues, like even the free calls or online paid subscribers, when they try to come for service, we would like to respond in a timely manner. I am not saying, well, we are perfect, but we are very committed to really double down on our execution to make sure truly they're all happening to all the users. My golly, if I talk about new use cases, probably I can speak for four or five minutes. I'll give you several. Like you see the PropNex uses Zoom for their virtual property tour. During the last 10 weeks, they have closed over 50% of the newly launched properties in Singapore over Zoom, and also the CSK, first law firm in Florida to have virtual trial by jury, and also, like South Coast Community Services, which is largest mental health service provider in California also use Zoom to offer mental health being mental health is becoming a very big problem. A lot of new use cases like that. So every day, I feel very, very excited to see so many new use cases, not to mention, like we just announced the partnership with the United States Tennis Association to offer the virtual experience is very cool. Yes. So, you know, first of all, ServiceNow has been a customer since 2018. They deployed Zoom to replace other video conferencing, web conferencing service with Zoom video conferencing. Over the past several years, we already established a great trust. We also announced the partnership. When they looked at their entire usage rate, they also deployed legacy, very costly, very complex, on-prem PBX system, why not consolidate into one system with a very consistent product front end experience, same back end architecture and in terms of total costs, much lower, user experience also much better? So that's why they decided to replace their legacy PBX system with one safety, standardized on Zoom unified communication solution. Thank you. Yes. First of all -- and we accomplished a lot over the past 90 days, but I can tell you that we take privacy and security extremely seriously. I'm not seeing we are going to give any of that. I would say the journey just starts, right? We are going to double down on privacy and security, and inside that, we also have a big R&D team, and our core technology, engineered leadership team here in San Jose. We also have an offshore team. Look at a lot of new use cases not only for enterprise, but also the kids' education, K-12 schools and telemedicine, there are so many use cases. I think this R&D team, I do not think that is -- we can really handle that in terms of scalability. We have to find more talents in a timely manner, and that's why we opened up 2 R&D offices in Phoenix and in Pittsburgh, and also, we would -- we like this onshore/offshore R&D model. That's why India have also opened up a big office. We hired our President of Product and Engineering for China, right, great leader, right? With that, we really want to hire engineers and not only here, but also other site, also even including remote engineers, right, because there are so many features and tasks, and that's why I want to invite you to join our Zoomtopia, which is our annual user conference. We'd like to service you very good product road map. Thank you. Yes, that's a great question. So, I would say this pandemic crisis completely accelerated every enterprise, every business customer's digital transformation, because you want to support employees no matter where they are, right, where the traditional on-prem system really is not applicable anymore, right? That's why you look at all the cloud with these software service companies doing very well. With respect to Zoom Phone, I think, overall, that's a part of our video conferencing offering. We truly believe video is the new voice. There's no reason for any business to deploy two separate systems, totally different experience. Hindsight of that, when customers who still deploy on-prem, legacy PBX system, when they migrate to cloud, they want to understand who has the better architecture. They want to consolidate into one system. That's the reason why we're positioned very well, and some other SMB customers already deploy maybe some other cloud with the PBX systems, they also want to consolidate into one system to further solidify their experience. So, overall, we even do not think that's two separate markets. It is just one thing. Video conferencing and cloud-based PBX are converged into one service. So that's our story when we talk with customers. The customer really likes that. Yes. Heather, that's a very great question. So I think prior to this pandemic crisis, if you look at enterprise, a very high percentage of customers is still deployed with the traditional on-prem legacy, costly PBX systems. However, I think this pandemic crisis, I think, is sort of like a wake-up call. You got to think about how to and focus, embrace digital transformation. Having cited that, in the cloud-based PBX, for sure, it's one of the things we've got to look into that. Another thing that's top priority as compared to the video conferencing, but for sure, it's on -- a lot of enterprise customers read that script. At the same time, I think they have a lot of other systems, not only for PBX, but also a lot of other systems. They also look at the cloud-based solution. I think this crisis just accelerated that migration from a traditional PBX and into the cloud-based system, and also Zoom is very well positioned. With a customer, they do not want to -- oh, I migrated to the cloud, and they also want to look at the new user experience, like a Zoom solution because this is the one existing. I think in the next 12 to 18 months, I would say you will see a little bit higher acceleration rate for enterprise customers to migrate to unified collaboration and communication solutions as Zoom. In terms of -- yes, just quickly in terms of competition, right, still the traditional legacy system and some other cloud-based PBX, but again, Zoom is much better positioned because we have one unified solution. Thank you, Heather. Yes. So, if you look at... Yes. Yes. So if you look at our free users or paid online subscriptions, right, it's coming almost everywhere. However, if you look at the number of visitors to our Web site, top countries like, for sure, U.S. obviously number one; and India number two; Japan number three; Canada, U.K. number four and number five. I think users are almost from every country, right? They try to use Zoom because it's very easy. It's free, and if 40 minutes are not enough, they would like to pay, and some SMB customers, they also try our webinar service, and also the enterprise customer might try the phone service. I think organic growth because of the brand awareness, I think, really helped us. So for now, we just say, no matter where the users come from, we would like to take a step back to see where we can do differently to serve them better in terms of having a local data center, like we just announced a data center in Singapore, and also that we double down our India presence, and we are going to have a team to capture the growth from international expansions. Kelly, sorry, feel free to chime in. Yes, just to add on to what Kelly said, revenue-wise is very small, no impact. Previously, if you look at almost every country, we have online subscription. We have a direct sales out of China, but in China, the overall revenue were small, the online subscription, you need to have a special license, we already sold that before. So we would like to simplify our go-to-market because actually the support and sales associates, a lot of resources, right, why not simplify that just to leverage our third-party partners with a white labeling solution. I think that that's very sustainable and is good from our side. Thank you. Yes. That's a great question. That's why please join our Zoomtopia. I think, first of all, you're absolutely right. Zoom is not only a communications tool, go deep, right, because our mission is to develop a better service, better online video conferencing service, even better than face-to-face meeting, how to lever AI functionality, like not only have you the meeting transcription, but also how to analyze that in a timely manner. Let's say, if you change a topic, give you a quick reminder, hey, please slow down, right? So, based on face detection or something like that, all those AI features, and for us, look at it in the long run, right, language translation real time, and also how to shake hand remotely, a lot of cool features like that, and in the past, you look at the inflow of video and perspective, right, how to add some of the fun features like video filter and how to make the 3D video, leverage AR. I think a lot of technologies, right, not to mention 5G and in the future, I think that if you look at the future, a lot of those good technologies can truly make the video conferencing experience much better. Thank you. Please join us on -- at Zoomtopia. Thank you. Thank you. So, just to briefly add on to what Kelly said, if you look at the marketing efficiency, you look at our marketplace, we already have more than 700 third-party applications. That's another way for us, right, to promote our brand awareness, right? More and more integrations certainly can help our marketing efficiency. Thank you. First of all, I think you have a great question. So you have our vision right down. It looks like you have some great ideas. Actually, maybe after the call, I'd like to connect you with our product managers. I think you're absolutely right. If you look at our Zoomtopia, right, not only do we have webinar, but also we need to look at our entire online event management experience, right? It's not only to the real-time part, pre event and planning and marketing and promotion, marketing content and materials, every event, right, a lot of, I think, the content, right? I think having cited that, I think we believe this service has a strategic value to help further expand our webinar reach. Having cited that, I think in terms of sort of we do that everything by ourselves or bring a partner, maybe acquire somebody, I think it's too early to tell, but strategy-wise, you're absolutely right. That's got to be our focus, our priority. It's low-hanging fruits, right? Thank you. Kelly, do you want to take it? Alex, by the way, if your kid's school district had any questions or any feedback to Zoom, please let them know you know Zoom's CEO and can be there. Thank you, Alex. Well, first of all, your daughter Gigi's comments made my day today. I would like to talk to her. So speaking workplace, I think for now, I think for the foreseeable future, we all need to work from home, but we've got to think about the long-term planning. So, meaning, after the pandemic crisis is over, what the new workplace look like. We talk with many customers, partners. We believe, in terms of the working from home, this trend will stay. I'm not saying all of us will keep working from home. It's very, very likely it's a hybrid, meaning twice a week or three days a week, you can send all employees back at home, and some other time, we all keep working in the office, and also you can further consolidate a lot of the small offices, right? You do not need to have offices everywhere anymore. You also can hire talent almost everywhere, and for us, even for the workplace today, if you look at a lot of the companies, it is a very big open space. I think that may not work anymore in the future. Good news, we do have target for the next 10, maybe 12 months, we can optimize what the future workplace look like, but again, no matter what, I think tools like this continue can help. Thank you. Is Ittai still available? It looks like he has a question, right? No? Yes. So, thank you all for joining us today, and we're truly appreciative for your time. It has been a memorable first-half to our investors and analysts. We appreciate your continued support for Zoom. Thank you all. See you next quarter. Thank you. Thank you."

Welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Joining me today will be Zoom's Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan; and Zoom's CFO Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page on the zoom.com website. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call we will make forward-looking statements about our market size and growth strategy, our estimated and projected costs, margins, revenue, expenditures, investments, and growth rates, our future financial performance and other future events or trends, including the guidance for the second fiscal quarter of 2021 and full fiscal year guidance for 2021, our plans and objectives for future operations, growth, initiatives, or strategies, and the impact to Zoom's business from the COVID-19 pandemic. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results and which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including today's earnings press release and our latest 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today's webinar. And with that, let me turn it over to Eric. I think Eric\u2019s mic. Here he goes.\nEric Yuan: That\u2019s great. Thank you, Tom.\nTom McCallum: Yes.\nEric Yuan: First of all, thank you all for your time today. I still remember the first time when we had an earnings call last year, it was around less than 1,000 participants. Today, we have over 3,000 participants. Thank you all for your time. And I hope you are doing as well as is possible in this unique moment around the globe. To the frontline workers, we thank you for your courage and the tremendous sacrifices you are making to keep us healthy and our community running in this pandemic. Everyone at Zoom appreciates all your incredible work. COVID has brought pain for many, in particular, vulnerable communities. The black community in the United States has also recently experienced shocking and a senseless loss. To our communities and customers, especially those in the black community, Zoom is standing with you, not only today, but also into the future. Nearly 10 years ago, we created Zoom to build a better, simpler and more efficient video communications platform. Today, I am proud to see that our platform is serving a critical role beyond our original vision in enabling communication and collaboration for businesses, schools, consumers and in the global community to stay connected and operational during the COVID-19 pandemic. Navigating this process has been a humbling learning experience, giving us a newfound appreciation for what it means to be a video communications technology provider in times of need. Work-from-Home and social distance initiatives have meaningfully accelerated the adoption and traffic on the Zoom video communications platform. We have seen many use cases, not only from enterprises to maintain work productivity as part of the business continuity plans, but also from first-time consumer users for personal and social use to connect with friends and families, when physical gathering is not possible. Let me share some metrics that illustrate the demand we experienced in this past quarter. Customers with more than 10 employees grew 354% year-over-year, as we deployed millions of licenses for new customers in the quarter. One new banking customer deployed approximately 175,000 new Zoom enterprise licenses in the quarter. Usage by customers in the Global 2000 grew over 200% sequentially. We peaked at over 300 million daily meeting participants, free and paid, joining Zoom meetings in April 2020, up from 10 million in December 2019. Currently, we continue to see elevated levels of participants even as governments around the world have begun to ease stay-in-place restrictions. We had an approximately twentyfold increase in our metric of annualized meeting minutes run rate, which jumped from 100 billion at the end of January 2020 to over 2 trillion meeting minutes based on April 2020\u2019s run rate. Scaling capacity to meet this incredible increase in traffic and use cases while providing uninterrupted, reliable and high-quality services to our customers have been a tremendous undertaking for our team. And we could not have done it without relying on our partners. When the pandemic crisis started, our own data centers could not scale fast enough to handle the unprecedented traffic. Fortunately, some of the top public cloud providers were there to help. Immediately during the crisis, our long-time partner AWS and its CEO Andy Jassy enabled us to meet this rapidly increasing demand. As our demand increased and we had limited visibility into the growth, AWS was able to respond quickly by provisioning the majority of the new servers we needed, so sometimes adding several thousands a day for several days in a row. In April, our customer Oracle also showed a great support to help us. Not only did Larry Ellison record a great video to encourage our team to do the right things for the world, but also offered Oracle cloud support. We also provisioned a number of servers in the Oracle cloud as the demand for Zoom continued to increase. We are so grateful for their partnership and their responsiveness to provide capacity during this time. While the COVID-19 pandemic has expanded our market opportunities, it also brought us many challenges. Prior to the pandemic, Zoom was primarily built for and used by large enterprises and institutions. During the crisis, with good intentions, we opened our platform to unprecedented numbers of first-time users without fully considering the challenges it would bring to those who did not have full IT support, or established protocols for security and privacy like our enterprise customers. As a result, we have experienced negative price related to meeting disruption, security and privacy issues. Since these issues emerged, we have transparently and quickly addressed specific security and privacy issues, including: enacted a 90 day plan initiative on security and privacy with a weekly webinar for customers to ask me anything, acquired Keybase team to add engineering expertise to build an end-to-end encrypted meeting mode, also released Zoom 5.0 cloud with new security features and enhancements to give customers unparalleled control over their meetings and data. The new release also includes support for AES 256-bit GCM encryption and ability to report platform misuse to Zoom\u2019s Trust& Safety Team. During this period of unprecedented usage growth and negative PR, as a CEO of Zoom, I was also facing tremendous pressure. And I reached out to the high-tech community and received great support from fellow CEOs, and many of them are my mentors. And I can\u2019t thank them enough for their advice. I\u2019m also deeply grateful to see the strong support from our valued enterprise customers, such as CEOs from Atlassian, Equinix, HubSpot, Okta, PagerDuty, Poly, SurveyMonkey and many others, both through public statements and video testimonials. With that, our users trust us to deliver the best and most secure video-first communications platform. I believe our result will continue to make us a stronger company for our customers and in the global community. Now let me discuss a few of our happy customers. We are thrilled to welcome Arm Technology to the Zoom family. Arm Technology is at the heart of a computing and data revolution that is transforming the way people live and businesses operate. In Q1, Arm chose to deploy approximately 8,000 Zoom Meeting licenses, 800 Zoom Rooms and 9,000 Zoom Phones to deliver a one-touch experience to their employees globally. We are also happy to welcome Baker McKenzie. One of Baker McKenzie\u2019s distinguished strengths is their use of cutting-edge technologies to help clients overcome the challenges of competing in today's economic world. We feel privileged to be the video communications platform of choice for the number one law firm brand in the world. Thank you, Arm and Baker McKenzie. On a final note, we welcomed Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster to serve as an independent director on Zoom's Board of Directors, Velchamy Sankarlingam as President of Engineering and Product, and Damien Hooper-Campbell as Chief Diversity Officer. Bringing their expertise to Zoom will be instrumental as we navigate rapid growth, transformation and scale. I want to commend and thank our 2,854 employees for what we have accomplished together, and for working tirelessly over the past quarter to support millions of participants around the globe. With that, let me turn things over to Kelly. By the way, I forgot to mention, today is also our CFO Kelly's birthday. So happy birthday, Kelly.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric. And this is the best birthday present I could ever have. Hello everybody. Q1 was an exceptional and pivotal quarter for Zoom. We are grateful for the incredible increase in demand as millions of doctors and patients, teachers and students, businesses and consumers chose Zoom to deliver critical communication and connection in a time of need. It speaks greatly of their trust and the quality and ease-of-use of our technology platform. We are also proud of our efforts to support our customers, employees and the global community during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to opening up our platform to deliver free services to over 100,000 K-12 schools in 25 countries and millions of people around the world, especially those in areas highly impacted by the crisis, we have also donated $1.4 million to COVID-19 focused charities and funded another $1 million of stock to launch our charitable fund, Zoom Cares. The key long-term focus of Zoom Cares includes education, social equity and climate change. Internally, we provided a one-time bonus, equivalent to two weeks of pay, for all Zoom's non-commissioned employees to offset costs associated with any disruption caused by the crisis. Not only has the world changed since we last reported results in early March, but so as Zoom's market opportunities and growth trajectory. Let me start by reviewing our financial results for Q1, then discussing our outlook for Q2, and the full year of FY \u201821 that has been recalibrated to adjust for the new trends and scale of our business. Total revenue grew 169% year-over-year to $328 million in Q1. This topline result significantly exceeded the high-end of our guidance range of $201 million due to the increase in demand and strong sales execution in the quarter. For the quarter, the growth in revenue was primarily due to subscriptions provided to new customers, which accounted for approximately 71% of the increase, while subscriptions provided to existing customers accounted for approximately 29% of the increase. This demand was broad-based across industry verticals, geographies and customer cohorts. Let's take a look at the key customer metrics for Q1. We continue to see expansion in the up-market as we ended Q1 at 769 customers with greater than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue, up 90% year-over-year. This is an increase of 128 customers over Q4, a record number of adds in a quarter. Further demonstrating the strength in the up-market was the addition of over 500 customers with greater than $100,000 in annual recurring revenue in Q1. This is a one-time metric that we are sharing to provide more insight to our Q1 results. For customers with more than 10 employees, we added over 183,000 in Q1, exiting with a total of approximately 265,000 customers in this segment. Year-over-year, we added over 206,000 new customers, growing 354%. While this is remarkable growth, our customer segment with 10 or fewer employees also expanded during the quarter as individuals adopted Zoom for many personal and social uses. As a result, we have experienced a mix shift of customer cohorts, where customers with 10 or fewer employees represented 30% of revenue in Q1, up significantly from 20% in Q4. In addition, the increase in customers with 10 or fewer employees also shifted our billing mix, as these customers generally pay monthly, rather than annually like most enterprise customers. Our net dollar expansion was over 130% for the eighth consecutive quarter, as existing customers continue to support and trust Zoom to be their video communications platform of choice. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Americas grew at a rate of 150% year-over-year. However, our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew even faster at 246% year-over-year and represented approximately 25% of revenue. International expansion is a key growth initiative for Zoom. Our global brand awareness has spread more quickly and we have expanded into more countries than we had originally planned for FY '21. Now turning to profitability, the increase in demand and execution drove net income profitability from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. For my following comments, I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude the charitable donation of common stock, stock-based compensation expense and related share-based equity taxes. Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 69.4% compared to 80.9% in Q1 last year and 84.2% last quarter. Although in early March, we originally guided lower based on an increase in usage of our platform, our gross margin was further impacted by the elevated demand, especially higher levels of free meeting minutes, including those from K-12 schools in March and April. Higher incremental cost also resulted from leveraging the public cloud providers, which was critical to our ability to meet the sudden exponential growth in usage, as the crisis spread and governments instituted stay-in-place policies around the world. Moving forward, as we build additional capacity in our own data centers, we expect to gain some efficiencies, bringing gross margin back to the mid-70s in the next several quarters ahead. R&D expense in Q1 was approximately $21 million, up 66% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D was 6%, which was lower than Q1 last year mainly due to the strong topline growth. In FY '21, we plan to continue investing in R&D to drive innovation and security functionality, including leveraging the expertise and resources from top security firms. Also, we recently announced the addition of two Engineering Centers of Excellence where we expect to add up to 500 software engineers in the next few years. The new R&D centers in Greater Phoenix, Arizona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania will both be located near top engineering universities. Sales and Marketing expense for Q1 was $104 million. This reflects an increase of 69% or $42 million over last year with investments to drive future growth. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing was 32%, a decrease from Q1 last year mainly due to strong topline growth. Overall, the increase in expense was attributable to record sales hiring and higher sales commissions due to strong execution, while we saw efficiencies in marketing. We are expanding our hiring plans for the rest of year to meet the opportunity presented in this new environment. G&A expense in Q1 was $49 million, up 196% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 15% of total revenue, up from Q1 last year, due to higher accruals for telco taxes from higher billings, a one-time license payment and external professional services. Non-GAAP operating income was $55 million, translating to a 16.6% non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter. This compares to Q1 last year\u2019s result of $8 million and 6.7% margin. Again, the higher revenue plus strong execution across all areas were the main drivers of this additional profit. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q1 was $0.20 on approximately $295 million of non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.10 higher than our guidance and $0.17 higher than Q1 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $552 million, up 270% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $1.1 billion, up 184% from $377 million year-over-year. The increase in RPO is consistent with the increase in demand and strong execution in the quarter. We expect to recognize approximately 72% or $772 million of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 64% or $240 million in Q1 of last year. We ended Q1 with approximately $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. In Q1, we had exceptional operating cash flow of $259 million, up from $22 million year-over-year. Free cash flow was $252 million, up from $15 million year-over-year. The increase is attributable to strong collections from topline growth, higher percentage of monthly contracts, as well as billings that started early in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to increase capital expenditures for additional data center infrastructure. And as a reminder, we will see the semi-annual cadence of net cash outflows from ESPP purchases to occur in Q2. Now turning to guidance, as I have mentioned earlier, the current environment has expanded Zoom\u2019s market opportunities and outlook as the increase in demand propelled us to a higher growth trajectory than originally planned for this year. This requires us to recalibrate our original FY \u201821 plan for the new scale of our business. The COVID-19 pandemic added unprecedented new variable to our business model, where historical knowledge may no longer apply. Today, as we present our current best estimate of future quarters based on new assumptions of the dramatic shift in our business, we caution that the impact and extent of the crisis and its associated economic concerns remain largely unknown. Significant variations from our assumptions could cause us to modify our guidance. With that, we provide a higher outlook for FY \u201821 based on our view of the current business environment. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $495 million to $500 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $130 million to $135 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.44 to $0.46 based on approximately 299 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY \u201821, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.775 billion to $1.8 billion, which would be approximately 185% to 189% year-over-year growth. Let me now provide a bit more context on the assumptions behind our guidance. As I discussed earlier, we have a far higher portion of revenue attributable to new customers with 10 or fewer employees, who opted for monthly contracts. Historically, monthly subscribers have a higher churn rate compared to annual or multi-year subscribers. In addition, as governments start to ease shelter-in-place restrictions, we may see a moderation of demand for our services. Given our assumptions on higher churn rate as well as economic uncertainty, we are projecting Q3 and Q4 revenue to be relatively consistent with Q2. For the full year of FY \u201821, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $355 million to $380 million. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.21 to $1.29 for the full year FY \u201821, based on approximately 300 million shares outstanding. In closing, we executed well in Q1 and are proud of how our team dedicated themselves to support our customers and global community. Thank you to the entire Zoom team. And everyone, please stay healthy and safe. With that, let's open it up for questions. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue-up our first question.\nOperator: Before our first question, actually, Eric has asked me to open the mic for him. Eric, I think you\u2019re muted.\nEric Yuan: Yes, I am muted.\nOperator: Okay. Our first question is from Alex Zukin with RBC.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, Eric. Thanks for taking my question and thanks for everything you do. You just delivered one of, if not the greatest all time quarter in enterprise software history, I think you've been given an amazing opportunity with Zoom becoming not just a verb, but really the poster child for enabling remote work. But with that opportunity also comes a question, which is, where does Zoom go from here? How do we think about the percentage of your TAM that's been penetrated in the current environment? What are the most exciting incremental growth drivers? And do you have an update for us in terms of the long-term vision of your company, because it seems like the prior long-term vision were there? And I got a quick follow-up.\nEric Yuan: Alex, great questions. And if we have a time, I\u2019d probably spend more time also want to get it otherwise, what's the future? But anyway, I truly believe video is a new voice. Video is going to change everything about the communication. The way for us to work, live and play is completely changed. From that perspective a huge opportunity, a lot of opportunities ahead of us. However, for now our top priority is to how to make sure we always keep our service up, because so many peoples are counting on Zoom to stay connected. Our top priority is to make sure keep the service up, double down triple down on the privacy, security issues. And also down the road, we are going to figure out where we are going to double down on the new growth areas. But for now, I think one thing we know for sure is the TAM is bigger than we saw it before right? And it's how to capture that we of the new TAM I think there's something very important. Also a lot of other new opportunities, our team are going to working together, right, to get to there, step-by-step. But now, number one thing is focus on the current product and the user experience, make sure during this pandemic crisis, hopefully it can end very soon, they can leverage Zoom to stay connected.\nTom McCallum: Next question, please, Matt?\nOperator: Our next question is from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.\nSterling Auty: Thanks. Hi, guys. So Eric, maybe a technology question for you. You did your 90 day program and end-to-end encryption really became a big focal point of discussion around security and privacy. You made the acquisition. Can you update us on when you plan to deploy? And then the encryption, how will it be deployed? And is there actually an opportunity to monetize it perhaps as an upsell?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Sterling, that's a good question. Before I answer to that question, I'd like to take a step back to share with you what\u2019s the industry standard for now, like Zoom or other competitors, because I mean, in this real-time collaboration industry for a long, long time. For now, I think most of the vendors we all use AES 256-bit either GCM or CBC, that's a standard. The reason why, if you enable end-to-end encryption, guess what, you cannot use your phone to dial in. You cannot support a traditional, old legacy, hardware [indiscernible] and SIP devices. And plus the cloud recording also is not available with some limitations. That's why for now most of the industry conferencing vendors do not support this feature. However we believe, no matter what, we needed to support that as well advance the feature. To give a customer see, your meeting is extremely sensitive. You don't want Zoom know the session key. Yet you can enable this feature with the limited functionality. It can all let the phone to dial in. And inside of that, we think this feature should be part of our offering. We do not want to charge based on the feature we try to customer more, that's not like that. So we want to give to at least the enterprise customer or business customer. Free users, for sure, we don't want to give that, right? Because we also want to work it together, see if this with FBI, with local law enforcement, in case some people they use Zoom for the better purpose, right? I think we also published a whitepaper I think a week ago right? And the opportunity to get a hub we got a lot of feedback and our team for now we're working on execution now. So I think soon we're going to know our release day. For now, we are seeing to review our whitepaper. So we have a confidence this will be a very good feature for our enterprise customers.\nSterling Auty: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Sterling. You can join us as a beta tester.\nSterling Auty: Sounds great.\nTom McCallum: Great. Next question please, Matt?\nOperator: The next question is from Nikolay Beliov with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.\nNikolay Beliov: Hi, can you guys hear me?\nEric Yuan: Yes \nNikolay Beliov: Kelly, happy birthday, and look forward to chatting with you on Thursday at our conference. My question is I would like you guys to provide us with a little more context on the guidance. I was wondering what trends you saw in the business during the month of May. And what gives you confidence that those prosumers, increasing the mix from 20% to 30% are going to stay for the rest of the year? Just trying to get more color around the confidence in the guide.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, in the guidance what we have considered, especially around those prosumers, as you call them the monthly users, we assume that there is an escalated that the term will be escalated in terms of historical. So we've assumed a multiples of what the historical churn rates have been. And also we have taken a conservative approach in terms of thinking about that in terms of potential uncertainty around the economic environment. With that said, I want to make sure you understand that while we did see an increased growth of monthlies is about half of our sales in the quarter came from monthly subscribers. When you look at the sales from our direct sales organization, the percentage of monthly subscribers was consistent with historical. So we didn't see an increase in monthly subscribers in the upmarket, we saw the same percentage as we have historically. And those typically, the churn in that segment when they\u2019re annual or multi-year is a fraction of what the monthly subscribers are.\nNikolay Beliov: And Kelly, in this context, if I may ask a follow-up, billings grew 350% and CRPO grow around 220%. Why the discrepancy here? And what does it mean to revenues? And how revenues flow-through from CRPO and billings?\nKelly Steckelberg: So, thank you about the question about billings and RPO. As you know, we don't provide specific guidance around billings or RPO. Given the fact that it's actually been exacerbated with the growth in the subscribers, they are just very difficult for metric. They don't apply because of the high-rate of monthly billings and subscribers. They're just not good metrics for us.\nNikolay Beliov: Got it. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Next question, please, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Kurtz with KeyBanc.\nAlex Kurtz: Yes. Thanks. Zukin\u2019s earlier question about growth opportunities, kind of a once in a lifetime opportunity to reimagine investments in new products, new sales coverage. And I mean, just look at your operating income this quarter next quarter, you couldn't have imagined that at the time of the IPO. So as the team and the Board look at the next 12 months, is there something that you guys are really laser-focused on that you could take all this extra cash flow and reinvest back into the business?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Alex, again, that's a great question. So, even before this pandemic crisis, not only do we offer the video conferencing service, but also we have a Zoom phone system. And don't forget about that is also huge opportunity. In particular, we believe video and voice, those two are going to be key words into one service, that's a huge, huge opportunity. This pandemic crisis, I would say on the one hand, accelerated the video adoption. On the other hand, it was brand recognition, plus a lot of a prosumer, so a lot of the new use cases. Like online education, telemedicine, tele-health. For sure, we would like to double down on that. But in terms of specific opportunity on one new service, we are going to work on that in the next several months. And as I mentioned earlier, for now, we needed to make sure we still keep helping people stay connected. Another thing also, we know for sure is, the way for us to work in the future totally different and how to make sure focus on the whole new experience, right, to make sure that you have very consistent experience when you work in the office and work in the home. A lot of innovations will be upon that as well. I actually believe a lot of opportunities, but we got to be very careful. You are so right. Where we should double it down? Where we may not leave to our partners, right, to develop those applications or leverage those opportunities upon our platform.\nAlex Kurtz: Thanks. And then a quick question for Kelly. In the areas where they've been lifting the quarantine, the shelter-in-places, have you seen any kind of change in churn in those regions whether it's in the U.S., Europe or Asia?\nKelly Steckelberg: It's really too early to tell, Alex. We've taken again a conservative approach to that. But it's too early to tell as most places even when they're starting to ease, shelter-in-place, people are taking their time to go back to work.\nAlex Kurtz: Makes sense. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Next question, please, Matt.\nOperator: Yes. Our next question is from Phil Winslow with Wells Fargo.\nPhil Winslow: Thanks for taking my question. Two questions. First for Kelly, then one for Eric. Kelly, when you think about retention, that's something that's come up a lot on this call. What programs you have in place to make sure that all these users that you've added stick to the platform? I\u2019m wondering if you can talk to us through the programs you\u2019ve had in place. And then also Eric, would you think about Zoom Phone and particularly not just retention but also upsell Zoom Phone, a similar thing, what is going to be the messaging to customers? How do you think about the potential in a year from now, six months from now et cetera attaching a full unified communications suite to that video customer?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, in terms of retention, first of all, for all of our customers new and existing we have a great customer success team that is focused on ensuring training, usage adoption happen in all of our customers, as well as we're looking for opportunities with our monthly subscribers to put forward offers to them to see if they would like to upgrade to an annual contract that we feel helping them evaluate [indiscernible] as well.\nEric Yuan: So Philip, back to your second question. So, as I mentioned earlier, we believe the video and voice those two are going to be converted into one service. Our team, we share our vision to our existing installed base, take Q1 for example. One of the very large global pharmaceutical companies, they were our heavy Zoom video conferencing customer. In Q1, they deployed a Zoom Phone, which is our largest phone deal. Around 18,000 phone licenses, right? Because they like the one consistent experience, more and more opportunity they like. Call you from a number, one more click on the upgrade video with the same experience. I think there's huge opportunity. Not to mention a lot of enterprise customers for now they still deploy on-prem and PBX solution. I think in this pandemic crisis, we helped them to accelerate their migration from on-prem to enterprise will further boost the cloud-based PBX adoption. So we think that's a huge opportunity ahead of us.\nPhil Winslow: Great. Thanks, guys. I do appreciate you enabling my kids to still go to school.\nEric Yuan: Thank you. By the way, I like your -- what your background is pretty nice.\nPhil Winslow: Thank you. Branding, marketing.\nEric Yuan: Yes. I love that.\nTom McCallum: Great. Next question please, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pat Walravens with JMP.\nPat Walravens: Great. Thank you. And happy birthday, Kelly.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks Pat.\nPat Walravens: So Eric, you started as an enterprise company, but now so many individuals are using Zoom to connect with their friends and their families and their classmates. When I go to say goodnight to my daughter at night, I get a lot of \u201cDaddy, I'm talking to my friends, come back later.\u201d So how is that changing your strategy going forward? What's your consumer strategy?\nEric Yuan: I think it\u2019s a great question. My kids also use Zoom as well for their online classes. I believe, you go back to the voice, right, the voice, no matter where you're using a voice like a phone call, right? My kids and myself or in the office, on the way home at the same experience, used to be with due to Zoom, when we enable knowledge workers or business communication and collaboration. For now, given that, video conferencing is going to become a mainstream service. The boundary between the prosumers and consumers or enterprise customers is not a direct clear anymore. We got to have maintain a very consistent experience. So that's why a lot of features we build for enterprise customers can be easily similar as they used to by prosumers consumers. However, we got to make sure, right, for enterprise customers, we already have all those security features to be in, how to easily let consumers in it to enable that this is the challenge we are facing. In terms of opportunity, I do not think we needed to have a specific consumer strategy. Our strategies offer one service, no matter where you are, no matter what you do, no matter which device, it just help you to stay connected. The infrastructure services now, no internet service party cannot say, hey, you are using internet for what, for various collaboration or for consumer. It's a same thing now. That's a huge opportunity.\nPat Walravens: If I can ask Kelly a quick question. And thank you, Eric. I know sometimes when you are replacing a competitor and they have an existing contract, you sign up the customer, but then you let them have how every months are left on the competitors' contract for free?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nPat Walravens: When you do that, how do you account for that? Does that count as one of your new customers? And does that have any impact on billings or RPO?\nKelly Steckelberg: So we do count them as a new customer. And under the new revenue standard for 606, the entire revenue gets amortized over the full period including the free periods.\nPat Walravens: Okay. And so that would go into billings to them?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. We do build them upfront.\nPat Walravens: Thank you very much.\nKelly Steckelberg: It depends on what their period is, but yes, it's part of it.\nPat Walravens: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Next question, please, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. I just wanted to ask a question on, as you go forward with hiring salespeople. With the influx in new customers, do you change from looking for more gatherers versus hunters? And just as you look to layer on Zoom Phone, is the channel strategy still as important or as an overlay sales team kind of more important going forward? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Yes. So on the one hand, for sure we already doubled down our sales hiring by starting late last year. I think we made a very good progress in Q1, not only hunters, EPI, SDR [ph], account executive, which was quota-carrying reps, but also for the phone right? It used to be look at our videoconference service primarily driven by our direct sales team. For the phone business, it's very different. That's why we really shift our focus not only for direct sales, but also we embraced our partner program like a master agent, and really helped us a lot during the Q1. I think, we are going to do more and more on partner deals, on channel sales program or on our phone business. I think the team is working very hard on that.\nMeta Marshall: Got it. Thanks, and congratulations.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you. Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: Our next question is from Heather Bellini with Goldman Sachs. Heather, can you unmute?\nHeather Bellini: Great. Sorry about that. Look, I just wanted to say first of all, thank you for the company and with your steering acting the way it did over the last few months, which has been just such a trying time for so many. But not only obviously did you enable all of us to stay in touch and working, but just being able to still connect with family and friends. So thank you, I think on behalf of everybody. My question has to do with your view and you've been asked a little bit about the Zoom Phone cross sell opportunity here. And I know you've touched on it a little bit already. But I'm interested in again a little bit about your vision on how you can expand your offerings given how much broader your customer bases now? So I guess the two parts are, what are you seeing in terms of uptake of Zoom Phone? Is there anything you could share with us about penetration rates or the seat count that you're at now, or maybe just how you might have seen adoption inflect in the quarter? So anything around that just so we can see how that's starting to take off given how many more new customers you've added? But also when you look at this evolving collaboration market, what's next for you all? Because you have phone, you obviously have video. Should we expect a chat service at some point just so we could close the loop on the entire messaging experience? So any thoughts you have there? Thank you so much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Heather. Maybe Kelly, you can address to the phone questions. I will answer to the second part of the question.\nKelly Steckelberg: So the primary demand and focus of our new customers and expanding customers in Q1 was really ensuring business continuity. And so they were focusing mostly on the video communication platform. But as our focus for Zoom Phone is to step sell into our existing installed base, it now creates a huge opportunity for more sales in Q2 and the rest of this year. So we're really looking forward to that team having an expanding customer base to sell to.\nEric Yuan: So to answer to your second question, if you look at the video collaboration business, as I mentioned earlier, TAM is bigger. The add up with the phone, together, I think is also a huge market. Not to mention, we also have online business. Online business used to be a small portion of our total net MRR growth. For now, given the popularity of the video conferencing, a lot of our consumers and prosumers, they all use Zoom for online [indiscernible] on a learning teaching class, it can be used. The use case is much more broad. For sure, we can monitor that. Once you for sure we know we are not again to support advertisement model, we are not going to support that and never wanted to sell customer data. So that's something we knew for sure, we will not do it. However, in terms of how to embrace all kinds of prosumer to the use cases, I think there's a lot of ways to monetize. Online subscription, you already see the number. It\u2019s not -- as we keep the service up keep the innovation, I think we are getting more and more online buyers as well. So regarding the new services, I think the video voice, that's our company DNA. In terms of a chat message, we also have a building a chat, but also we really look at everything from customer perspective, They deployed a Slack, it\u2019s great. We have a wonderful integration with Slack, it\u2019s a great service. And a customer deploy max of teams, we also interpret integrated with max of teams very well. And so some customers, they want to spend to standardize on Zoom platform, okay, too. Our video voice, we also have a chat built in. So from that perspective, we are taking a very open flexible approach and looking at everything from a customer perspective. But overall, we are going to be laser-focused on video and voice enterprise, brilliance [ph] and consumer prosumer as well. Thank you for that.\nTom McCallum: Matt, next question please.\nOperator: Next question is from Walter Pritchard with Citi.\nWalter Pritchard: Hi thanks. A question for Kelly, I'm wondering if you could help us understand on the churn side, obviously unprecedented demand for those under 10 employee monthly type customers. Any order of magnitude you can put around the sort of churn versus what it's been historically that you're thinking about in the forecast? And then I had one follow-up.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. All I would say is that we're taking a very conservative approach, assuming that the historic norms don't necessarily apply to this new cohort, both from the magnitude as well as the potential around economic uncertainty. So the way we're forecasting it is using multiples of the historic churn rates.\nWalter Pritchard: And then maybe as you get into -- the obviously next quarter is going to be just sort of more of what you have this quarter in terms of a full quarter of all the business. But as you think about then the quarters beyond that, how do you think about just a sustainable level of new customer ads? I mean, do you feel like what's happened here has pulled forward multiple years of demand? Or do you think it has opened up awareness so much to what you do that you could actually see higher levels of new customer ads as we get past this big bump up that we've seen with COVID?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. I mean, we certainly have seen a lot of pipeline creation in the quarter in both Q1 and in early Q2, so that's been positive to see. And remember that our selling strategy around Zoom Phone, as well as Zoom Rooms is to sell into our existing customer base. So this just creates a whole new opportunity around those future products as selling those products in the future as well.\nWalter Pritchard: Okay. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Walter. Next question, please Matt.\nOperator: Next question is from Zane Chrane with Bernstein.\nZane Chrane: Thank you, guys. Eric, Tom, Kelly and as everybody at the Zoom team, I just want to say thank you for your corporate leadership and the role of corporate citizenship that we all needed during this time, especially the things that you guys have done in the educational space. I'm wondering, how do you think about balancing the data security and privacy concerns versus ease of use? It seems like that's always a balancing act where if you lean too far, one way or the other, you're going to upset one type of customer, and that becomes even more complex now that you're heavily moving into the consumer space. How do you balance that kind of from a technological and user interface perspective? And then I have one follow-up to that.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Zane, thank you. This is a great question. So, our service was built for serving enterprise customers. And we have all kinds of security features built in. Normally, we're working together with the enterprise IT team, right, to evaluate our service from a security perspective. And they are going to enable or disable those security features and we have official onboarding process. And we really understand how that process works. However during this pandemic crisis we have lots of first time users. As a CEO, I think I should have done a better job. The reason why, not only do we have our service, but also we should have played a role of IT for those first time users. In terms of enabling [indiscernible] work and meeting room or a lot of features, this is a mistake I made. So we learned a hard lesson. And that's why I said when we look at enterprise customers and consumers, there's a little bit of different obvious philosophy. For enterprise customers, just to keep any other secured features. However, for prosumers is different. Sometimes you're so right, whenever there's a treat of a conflict that's why we doubled down our security. We want to leverage this opportunity to completely transform our business to be the most secured solution. However, if there's a conflict between the privacy security versus usability, I think the privacy security is more important than usability. Like a three clicks, yes, customer may not like it, they want to two clicks. But if there's a privacy issue, yes, we still want to have three clicks. So that's why, however and we do have a team, we review every use case, every feature, we want to make sure focus on the privacy security. At the same time, do all we can lose the ease of use; that's also critical. So, that's why we hired a lot of security researchers, engineers to make sure on the one hand, we are very secure, safe to use, on the other hand, also how to balance. This is an ongoing effort, we are committed.\nZane Chrane: Very helpful. And just a quick follow-up to what Heather was asking. She mentioned chat, I've been thinking, is there opportunity for embedding more cloud based storage or file sharing to enable more real-time collaboration in file sharing or editing while on a Zoom call? Is that something you guys have considered? Or, like, I know you have a partnership with Dropbox. Is there something that would maybe make sense to build out yourself or even acquire some capability along those lines?\nEric Yuan: Yes, good question. So yes, we already announced the partnership with Dropbox before, recently also, partnership with Box as well, with a seamless integration. We also support Microsoft Drive, Google Drive as well, essentially, within the meeting interface, you want to share the files from those cloud providers. I think, overall, we are focused on the customer experience. As I mentioned earlier, video and the voice is still critical to our business in the future. So for now, we just want to integrate, interoperate with other best of breed service providers.\nZane Chrane: Excellent. Thank you, guys. Congrats.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thanks Zane. Next question, please, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bhavan Suri with William Blair.\nBhavan Suri: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just have one, it's really around competition right. In last few months, given your success and given COVID, we've seen BlueJeans being acquired. [indiscernible] IPO of RingCentral announced their own video solution. I'd love to understand none of these actually imply anything immediately material in the competitive environment. But obviously, the investments are playing out in that environment, I'd love to think about how do you think about navigating through this and differentiating? Obviously, the scale you have is a differentiator. But how do you think about the competitive technology differentiation in the space? I\u2019d love to Eric get your thoughts around that. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yes, sorry. I lost for several seconds. Pressed going back conduct the meeting.\nBhavan Suri: I know maybe I did, too. But did you hear it or it was around competitive environment or around RingCentral introducing video, it's around [indiscernible] how do you think about the competitive environment? Has it changed? And how do you navigate it?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So you look at a competitive landscape, I think this pandemic crisis does not change anything. And we are still laser-focused video. And also we have a phone service. Pick, for sure, the market opportunity is much bigger than before now, right? You take a Ring Central for an example. They were focusing on the phone service, which was on video, we added a Cloud PBX, they added a video conferencing. We will put a pattern but for now, the market is bigger. I would say any competition is always good for consumers, right? And so, if there's no competitors, there's any use. So we are okay, so we do everything from end user perspective.\nBhavan Suri: Fair enough. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Next question please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan MacWilliams with Stephens.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks for taking the questions. So I attended a Zoom Wedding last month and it went great. And my own wedding in September might be over Zoom. So I just want to say thank you for providing a backup plan there. Really a standout quarter and congrats on the execution. For Kelly, for the second quarter, would you expect new recurring revenue added in the second quarter to be above the recurring revenue added in the fourth quarter of last year? I just have one follow-up.\nKelly Steckelberg: New recurring revenue in Q2 to be greater than Q4, yes, based on the outlook, I think that it will increase the historicals in front of me. It is an increase over what it would be as compared to Q4. Yes.\nRyan MacWilliams: Perfect. I mean, I can't really compare it to the last quarter. And then Eric, just on addressing up Bhavan\u2019s last question. You mentioned in your comments that enterprise communications continue to be a fragmented market, low overall cloud penetration rate. But with both competitors and customers now trending towards one platform for cloud video and voice, over the next few years, do you see this market consolidating around maybe one to two competitors for enterprise applications?\nEric Yuan: Yes. It's too early to tell. But overall, I truly believe the best of breed service provider will survive and thrive, because customer -- when it comes to the video and voice, you got to make it work anytime, everywhere, any device. It's not that easy. Otherwise, the reason why during this pandemic crisis in the customer trust Zoom, to use Zoom because it just works. And the quality and a lot of innovations. And that's why I think, video and voice it's not that easy. If you can do the basic service with all the basic features, okay, but to make it work in 7/24, with no any outages and also focus on innovation it's not that straightforward. And that's why I think as long as we keep working harder, really listening our customers to be the first vendor understand their pinpoint, understand their use case, to be their first vendor to come up with a solution. Even if we have so many competitors, I think we're okay, because, again, this is a huge market opportunity. So we may not kind of serve every customer, but as long as we keep listening to our customers keep the innovation, I think we should be okay.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks. \nTom McCallum: Great. Thank you, Ryan. Congratulations. Can we have the next question please, Matt?\nOperator: Our next question is from James Fish with Piper.\nJames Fish: Hey, thanks for the question. Kelly, happy birthday. I\u2019d agree that June 2 is the best day of the year in my humblest of opinions. You guys talked about churn in the second-half of the year. I think if you can look at sort of some verticals like education or some consumer additions that you guys had in the quarter as potentially not sustainable in terms of that 300 million users. How should we think about that 300 million user number in terms of all added in education for example?\nKelly Steckelberg: Right, James. Could you just repeat the last part that how should we think about the 300 million user number in what?\nJames Fish: Just curious where you think that 300 million user count is actually -- what number is actually sustainable within the current customer base?\nKelly Steckelberg: So I just want to clarify that 300 million is daily participants both free and paid. So that was the peak that we saw in April. It has come down a little bit in May on average. But we still continue to see a high-level of usage of both free and paid users. So I think certainly over the long-term, we expect it to grow beyond that 300 million number.\nEric Yuan: By the way James, those 300 million meeting participants is -- that's just a meeting participants -- the number is not a unique. If you're joining five times in a day, we'll be counting five, right, from free users or paid users.\nJames Fish: Yes. Totally understand. And then just a quick follow-up, it's the eighth quarter in a row plus 130% net renewal rate. But could we get more color there as to how much stronger this quarter was from an upsell rate compared to the past few quarters?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. We've committed to providing the metric of being greater than 130% just because it bounces around for each period. And we don't want you to read too much into that. So that's the guidance that we're going to provide today.\nJames Fish: Got it. Thanks and congrats again.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you,\nTom McCallum: Matt, next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron: Hello, great quarter and happy birthday, Kelly. Fantastic. I had a couple of questions. First on Global 2000, you talked about how it grew 200% quarter-over-quarter. Those are generally very sophisticated organizations with a lot of IT dollars and they move very quickly. I guess my question is, as the penetration rate with meetings at that point, at this point, pretty much at 80% to 90% with that customer base. If we fully explored with the ones that have purchased with you, they are already -- where do you need to be given how fast you can usually move? And then the second question related to phones. Kelly, you mentioned that regarding a previous question on phones that a lot of the focus has been on video right now. But you said there is an upcoming expansion opportunity going forward. I guess the question is considering the environment, is the environment helpful in accelerating phone adoption or perhaps the other way around? We fight to organizations are looking to cut in spend, they already have an established phone system. And everybody's using their cell phones from home I guess at this point. Is phones something that can get a boost from COVID as well, given that it's not walking into a vacuum, every company has a phone system whereas very few have a very broad adoption of video?\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay. So in terms of your first question around penetration of the global 2K, that isn't a metric that we specifically disclosed. But the good news is that it's not as high as you throughout there. So we still have lots of opportunity to grow in that segment today, even with the significant growth that we saw quarter-over-quarter. And then in terms of the phone, I think given the land and expand strategy, and the significant increase we saw in new customers this quarter, we think that there is a lot of opportunity ahead. And that phone we talked about this probably before, but phone seems to really be the last area of IT that has been taken to the cloud. And as people have adopted more of Zoom, and they come to trust and rely on the ease of use and the reliability of the platform Phone is just the next natural step for them to take. So we're really excited about that opportunity and don't believe that the COVID pandemic should be an inhibitor to that.\nEric Yuan: So Kelly, right on. So it had to add on to what Kelly said. If you look at a phone as a separate or service, you're so right. Especially, during this pandemic, I have a cellphone number why do I needed to deploy another service, do not make any sense. However, if you think the phone is part of the video. Now phone and the video the same thing, the same service, you will know that the growth will follow as well. This is our vision. We are seeing the phone as the voice, the same thing, the same product, same service the same back, and the same experience. That's why we see the huge opportunity. If you want to sell our phone service as a separate service it's not a part of video conference service. You're still right. There's no reason for us to deploy a separate service, just the same phone number. What's the point? That's why I think we have a huge opportunity because of architecture, because of the phone and Zoom Video, the same service. So that's a very different.\nIttai Kidron: Very good. Good luck guys.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thanks, Ittai. Matt, next question, please.\nOperator: The next question comes from Will Power with Baird.\nWill Power: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I wondered if we could drill down a bit into the education segment, either in terms of revenue, or paid users. Something to give us some context. And how you're thinking about education in the second-half of the year as we get back to school? Obviously, still a lot of uncertainties around that. And I guess the other part to that is, are there any learnings from some of these countries where they've gone back to school in terms of usage, whether South Korea or elsewhere?\nKelly Steckelberg: So we don't break out the specific revenue by verticals. But what I can tell you is that from a growth perspective, education was the space\u2019s highest vertical with growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So we saw very strong execution and demand there. And looking forward, as a reminder, many universities and schools have announced that they are potentially hosting all of their classes in the fall remotely. So we expect that demands to be strong, even as we see certain easing their restrictions of shelter-in-place.\nEric Yuan: Yes. And by the way, we offer a free service to more than 100,000 K-12 schools around the globe. And, I think you\u2019re so right, after the summer, are they going to keep using zoom for online classes or what we should do? I think that's we\u2019re going to work on that. But for now we just to have those K-12 schools and because primarily we are focused on the high-ad before and now we have more and more K-12 schools. That's very different again.\nTom McCallum: Great. Thank you. Thank you, Will. Hey, Matt, we have time for probably one more question, please.\nOperator: Well, our final question then will be from Tom Roderick with Stifel.\nTom Roderick: Here we go. We'll get the mute off. Hi everybody. Thanks for taking my question, I appreciate it. So, I guess the question a lot have been a lot of the questions have been asked in the topline, but you had to scale up massively in a way that 90 days ago, we couldn't possibly have expected this. You started to see a little bit of this in China and perhaps even at the time, the last call Europe. So you had some awareness, but Kelly, even at that time, you were talking about gross margins in the 80% range. Can you just talk a little bit more about what you did? And how you managed to scale that business up so quickly? And then would love to hear just about the elasticity of that going forward to the extent that some of the monthly users do churn. Do you have the ability, and this may actually interact with the Oracle partnership that was announced late April? We'd love to just hear a little bit more about that the ability to scale up and scale down and how quickly you can do that?\nKelly Steckelberg: So first of all, I think huge thanks and credit to the entire employee base of Zoom. Many of them worked extended hours and lots of weekends to support our customers and this increased demand. Also huge thanks as Eric mentioned to many of our partners as well, who helped us scale up as we saw this unprecedented -- and it was difficult to forecast the expansion in our capacity that was needed. In terms of the ability to scale up, what we're focused on of course is we were like in gross margins, focusing on adding in the public cloud. And over time, we'll start to add more capacity in our colos to start to moderate that gross margin impact a little bit, as well as in other areas of the business, we scaled up with third party resources to help us. And over time, we'll look to backfill those with direct employees, which is more cost effective, but helped us get through this unprecedented increase in demand.\nEric Yuan: And also Tom, during this pandemic crisis, our top priority is to show our corporate social responsibility. Essentially, we do all we can to have people stay connected at no cost. We even look at, hey, if you had a several thousand servers, what's the cost look like this, no don't worry about that. This is time to help people stay connected. But down the road, after the pandemic crisis its sort of ended soon, I think for sure we are going to go back to our the gross margin focus.\nTom Roderick: Thank you, all. It's been a unique 90 days, so looking forward for next 90. I appreciate it.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Tom.\nTom McCallum: Eric, do you have any final closing remarks before we turn off the webinar?\nEric Yuan: Yes. I want to say just, thank you all, thank you every Zoom employees, thank you all the users, customers, thank you for your trust. Thank you for our shareholders. And we will do all we can to truly deliver happiness to you. We will not let you down. Thank you for the support and I the truly appreciate it.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. And this is the best birthday present I could ever have. Hello everybody. Q1 was an exceptional and pivotal quarter for Zoom. We are grateful for the incredible increase in demand as millions of doctors and patients, teachers and students, businesses and consumers chose Zoom to deliver critical communication and connection in a time of need. It speaks greatly of their trust and the quality and ease-of-use of our technology platform. We are also proud of our efforts to support our customers, employees and the global community during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to opening up our platform to deliver free services to over 100,000 K-12 schools in 25 countries and millions of people around the world, especially those in areas highly impacted by the crisis, we have also donated $1.4 million to COVID-19 focused charities and funded another $1 million of stock to launch our charitable fund, Zoom Cares. The key long-term focus of Zoom Cares includes education, social equity and climate change. Internally, we provided a one-time bonus, equivalent to two weeks of pay, for all Zoom's non-commissioned employees to offset costs associated with any disruption caused by the crisis. Not only has the world changed since we last reported results in early March, but so as Zoom's market opportunities and growth trajectory. Let me start by reviewing our financial results for Q1, then discussing our outlook for Q2, and the full year of FY \u201821 that has been recalibrated to adjust for the new trends and scale of our business. Total revenue grew 169% year-over-year to $328 million in Q1. This topline result significantly exceeded the high-end of our guidance range of $201 million due to the increase in demand and strong sales execution in the quarter. For the quarter, the growth in revenue was primarily due to subscriptions provided to new customers, which accounted for approximately 71% of the increase, while subscriptions provided to existing customers accounted for approximately 29% of the increase. This demand was broad-based across industry verticals, geographies and customer cohorts. Let's take a look at the key customer metrics for Q1. We continue to see expansion in the up-market as we ended Q1 at 769 customers with greater than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue, up 90% year-over-year. This is an increase of 128 customers over Q4, a record number of adds in a quarter. Further demonstrating the strength in the up-market was the addition of over 500 customers with greater than $100,000 in annual recurring revenue in Q1. This is a one-time metric that we are sharing to provide more insight to our Q1 results. For customers with more than 10 employees, we added over 183,000 in Q1, exiting with a total of approximately 265,000 customers in this segment. Year-over-year, we added over 206,000 new customers, growing 354%. While this is remarkable growth, our customer segment with 10 or fewer employees also expanded during the quarter as individuals adopted Zoom for many personal and social uses. As a result, we have experienced a mix shift of customer cohorts, where customers with 10 or fewer employees represented 30% of revenue in Q1, up significantly from 20% in Q4. In addition, the increase in customers with 10 or fewer employees also shifted our billing mix, as these customers generally pay monthly, rather than annually like most enterprise customers. Our net dollar expansion was over 130% for the eighth consecutive quarter, as existing customers continue to support and trust Zoom to be their video communications platform of choice. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Americas grew at a rate of 150% year-over-year. However, our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew even faster at 246% year-over-year and represented approximately 25% of revenue. International expansion is a key growth initiative for Zoom. Our global brand awareness has spread more quickly and we have expanded into more countries than we had originally planned for FY '21. Now turning to profitability, the increase in demand and execution drove net income profitability from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. For my following comments, I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude the charitable donation of common stock, stock-based compensation expense and related share-based equity taxes. Non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 69.4% compared to 80.9% in Q1 last year and 84.2% last quarter. Although in early March, we originally guided lower based on an increase in usage of our platform, our gross margin was further impacted by the elevated demand, especially higher levels of free meeting minutes, including those from K-12 schools in March and April. Higher incremental cost also resulted from leveraging the public cloud providers, which was critical to our ability to meet the sudden exponential growth in usage, as the crisis spread and governments instituted stay-in-place policies around the world. Moving forward, as we build additional capacity in our own data centers, we expect to gain some efficiencies, bringing gross margin back to the mid-70s in the next several quarters ahead. R&D expense in Q1 was approximately $21 million, up 66% year-over-year. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D was 6%, which was lower than Q1 last year mainly due to the strong topline growth. In FY '21, we plan to continue investing in R&D to drive innovation and security functionality, including leveraging the expertise and resources from top security firms. Also, we recently announced the addition of two Engineering Centers of Excellence where we expect to add up to 500 software engineers in the next few years. The new R&D centers in Greater Phoenix, Arizona and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania will both be located near top engineering universities. Sales and Marketing expense for Q1 was $104 million. This reflects an increase of 69% or $42 million over last year with investments to drive future growth. As a percentage of total revenue, sales and marketing was 32%, a decrease from Q1 last year mainly due to strong topline growth. Overall, the increase in expense was attributable to record sales hiring and higher sales commissions due to strong execution, while we saw efficiencies in marketing. We are expanding our hiring plans for the rest of year to meet the opportunity presented in this new environment. G&A expense in Q1 was $49 million, up 196% on a year-over-year basis. It represented 15% of total revenue, up from Q1 last year, due to higher accruals for telco taxes from higher billings, a one-time license payment and external professional services. Non-GAAP operating income was $55 million, translating to a 16.6% non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter. This compares to Q1 last year's result of $8 million and 6.7% margin. Again, the higher revenue plus strong execution across all areas were the main drivers of this additional profit. Non-GAAP earnings per share in Q1 was $0.20 on approximately $295 million of non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding and adjusting for undistributed earnings. This result is $0.10 higher than our guidance and $0.17 higher than Q1 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the quarter was $552 million, up 270% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $1.1 billion, up 184% from $377 million year-over-year. The increase in RPO is consistent with the increase in demand and strong execution in the quarter. We expect to recognize approximately 72% or $772 million of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 64% or $240 million in Q1 of last year. We ended Q1 with approximately $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. In Q1, we had exceptional operating cash flow of $259 million, up from $22 million year-over-year. Free cash flow was $252 million, up from $15 million year-over-year. The increase is attributable to strong collections from topline growth, higher percentage of monthly contracts, as well as billings that started early in the quarter. Looking ahead, we expect to increase capital expenditures for additional data center infrastructure. And as a reminder, we will see the semi-annual cadence of net cash outflows from ESPP purchases to occur in Q2. Now turning to guidance, as I have mentioned earlier, the current environment has expanded Zoom's market opportunities and outlook as the increase in demand propelled us to a higher growth trajectory than originally planned for this year. This requires us to recalibrate our original FY \u201821 plan for the new scale of our business. The COVID-19 pandemic added unprecedented new variable to our business model, where historical knowledge may no longer apply. Today, as we present our current best estimate of future quarters based on new assumptions of the dramatic shift in our business, we caution that the impact and extent of the crisis and its associated economic concerns remain largely unknown. Significant variations from our assumptions could cause us to modify our guidance. With that, we provide a higher outlook for FY \u201821 based on our view of the current business environment. For the second quarter, we expect revenue to be in the range of $495 million to $500 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $130 million to $135 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.44 to $0.46 based on approximately 299 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY \u201821, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.775 billion to $1.8 billion, which would be approximately 185% to 189% year-over-year growth. Let me now provide a bit more context on the assumptions behind our guidance. As I discussed earlier, we have a far higher portion of revenue attributable to new customers with 10 or fewer employees, who opted for monthly contracts. Historically, monthly subscribers have a higher churn rate compared to annual or multi-year subscribers. In addition, as governments start to ease shelter-in-place restrictions, we may see a moderation of demand for our services. Given our assumptions on higher churn rate as well as economic uncertainty, we are projecting Q3 and Q4 revenue to be relatively consistent with Q2. For the full year of FY \u201821, non-GAAP operating income is expected to be in the range of $355 million to $380 million. We expect to deliver non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.21 to $1.29 for the full year FY \u201821, based on approximately 300 million shares outstanding. In closing, we executed well in Q1 and are proud of how our team dedicated themselves to support our customers and global community. Thank you to the entire Zoom team. And everyone, please stay healthy and safe. With that, let's open it up for questions. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue-up our first question. So, in the guidance what we have considered, especially around those prosumers, as you call them the monthly users, we assume that there is an escalated that the term will be escalated in terms of historical. So we've assumed a multiples of what the historical churn rates have been. And also we have taken a conservative approach in terms of thinking about that in terms of potential uncertainty around the economic environment. With that said, I want to make sure you understand that while we did see an increased growth of monthlies is about half of our sales in the quarter came from monthly subscribers. When you look at the sales from our direct sales organization, the percentage of monthly subscribers was consistent with historical. So we didn't see an increase in monthly subscribers in the upmarket, we saw the same percentage as we have historically. And those typically, the churn in that segment when they're annual or multi-year is a fraction of what the monthly subscribers are. So, thank you about the question about billings and RPO. As you know, we don't provide specific guidance around billings or RPO. Given the fact that it's actually been exacerbated with the growth in the subscribers, they are just very difficult for metric. They don't apply because of the high-rate of monthly billings and subscribers. They're just not good metrics for us. It's really too early to tell, Alex. We've taken again a conservative approach to that. But it's too early to tell as most places even when they're starting to ease, shelter-in-place, people are taking their time to go back to work. Yes. So, in terms of retention, first of all, for all of our customers new and existing we have a great customer success team that is focused on ensuring training, usage adoption happen in all of our customers, as well as we're looking for opportunities with our monthly subscribers to put forward offers to them to see if they would like to upgrade to an annual contract that we feel helping them evaluate [indiscernible] as well. Thanks Pat. Yes. So we do count them as a new customer. And under the new revenue standard for 606, the entire revenue gets amortized over the full period including the free periods. Yes. We do build them upfront. It depends on what their period is, but yes, it's part of it. So the primary demand and focus of our new customers and expanding customers in Q1 was really ensuring business continuity. And so they were focusing mostly on the video communication platform. But as our focus for Zoom Phone is to step sell into our existing installed base, it now creates a huge opportunity for more sales in Q2 and the rest of this year. So we're really looking forward to that team having an expanding customer base to sell to. Yes. All I would say is that we're taking a very conservative approach, assuming that the historic norms don't necessarily apply to this new cohort, both from the magnitude as well as the potential around economic uncertainty. So the way we're forecasting it is using multiples of the historic churn rates. Yes. I mean, we certainly have seen a lot of pipeline creation in the quarter in both Q1 and in early Q2, so that's been positive to see. And remember that our selling strategy around Zoom Phone, as well as Zoom Rooms is to sell into our existing customer base. So this just creates a whole new opportunity around those future products as selling those products in the future as well. New recurring revenue in Q2 to be greater than Q4, yes, based on the outlook, I think that it will increase the historicals in front of me. It is an increase over what it would be as compared to Q4. Yes. Right, James. Could you just repeat the last part that how should we think about the 300 million user number in what? So I just want to clarify that 300 million is daily participants both free and paid. So that was the peak that we saw in April. It has come down a little bit in May on average. But we still continue to see a high-level of usage of both free and paid users. So I think certainly over the long-term, we expect it to grow beyond that 300 million number. Yes. We've committed to providing the metric of being greater than 130% just because it bounces around for each period. And we don't want you to read too much into that. So that's the guidance that we're going to provide today. Thank you, Okay. So in terms of your first question around penetration of the global 2K, that isn't a metric that we specifically disclosed. But the good news is that it's not as high as you throughout there. So we still have lots of opportunity to grow in that segment today, even with the significant growth that we saw quarter-over-quarter. And then in terms of the phone, I think given the land and expand strategy, and the significant increase we saw in new customers this quarter, we think that there is a lot of opportunity ahead. And that phone we talked about this probably before, but phone seems to really be the last area of IT that has been taken to the cloud. And as people have adopted more of Zoom, and they come to trust and rely on the ease of use and the reliability of the platform Phone is just the next natural step for them to take. So we're really excited about that opportunity and don't believe that the COVID pandemic should be an inhibitor to that. So we don't break out the specific revenue by verticals. But what I can tell you is that from a growth perspective, education was the space's highest vertical with growth on a quarter-over-quarter basis. So we saw very strong execution and demand there. And looking forward, as a reminder, many universities and schools have announced that they are potentially hosting all of their classes in the fall remotely. So we expect that demands to be strong, even as we see certain easing their restrictions of shelter-in-place. So first of all, I think huge thanks and credit to the entire employee base of Zoom. Many of them worked extended hours and lots of weekends to support our customers and this increased demand. Also huge thanks as Eric mentioned to many of our partners as well, who helped us scale up as we saw this unprecedented -- and it was difficult to forecast the expansion in our capacity that was needed. In terms of the ability to scale up, what we're focused on of course is we were like in gross margins, focusing on adding in the public cloud. And over time, we'll start to add more capacity in our colos to start to moderate that gross margin impact a little bit, as well as in other areas of the business, we scaled up with third party resources to help us. And over time, we'll look to backfill those with direct employees, which is more cost effective, but helped us get through this unprecedented increase in demand."

            "name": "Eric Yuan",
            "content": "That's great. Thank you, Tom. First of all, thank you all for your time today. I still remember the first time when we had an earnings call last year, it was around less than 1,000 participants. Today, we have over 3,000 participants. Thank you all for your time. And I hope you are doing as well as is possible in this unique moment around the globe. To the frontline workers, we thank you for your courage and the tremendous sacrifices you are making to keep us healthy and our community running in this pandemic. Everyone at Zoom appreciates all your incredible work. COVID has brought pain for many, in particular, vulnerable communities. The black community in the United States has also recently experienced shocking and a senseless loss. To our communities and customers, especially those in the black community, Zoom is standing with you, not only today, but also into the future. Nearly 10 years ago, we created Zoom to build a better, simpler and more efficient video communications platform. Today, I am proud to see that our platform is serving a critical role beyond our original vision in enabling communication and collaboration for businesses, schools, consumers and in the global community to stay connected and operational during the COVID-19 pandemic. Navigating this process has been a humbling learning experience, giving us a newfound appreciation for what it means to be a video communications technology provider in times of need. Work-from-Home and social distance initiatives have meaningfully accelerated the adoption and traffic on the Zoom video communications platform. We have seen many use cases, not only from enterprises to maintain work productivity as part of the business continuity plans, but also from first-time consumer users for personal and social use to connect with friends and families, when physical gathering is not possible. Let me share some metrics that illustrate the demand we experienced in this past quarter. Customers with more than 10 employees grew 354% year-over-year, as we deployed millions of licenses for new customers in the quarter. One new banking customer deployed approximately 175,000 new Zoom enterprise licenses in the quarter. Usage by customers in the Global 2000 grew over 200% sequentially. We peaked at over 300 million daily meeting participants, free and paid, joining Zoom meetings in April 2020, up from 10 million in December 2019. Currently, we continue to see elevated levels of participants even as governments around the world have begun to ease stay-in-place restrictions. We had an approximately twentyfold increase in our metric of annualized meeting minutes run rate, which jumped from 100 billion at the end of January 2020 to over 2 trillion meeting minutes based on April 2020's run rate. Scaling capacity to meet this incredible increase in traffic and use cases while providing uninterrupted, reliable and high-quality services to our customers have been a tremendous undertaking for our team. And we could not have done it without relying on our partners. When the pandemic crisis started, our own data centers could not scale fast enough to handle the unprecedented traffic. Fortunately, some of the top public cloud providers were there to help. Immediately during the crisis, our long-time partner AWS and its CEO Andy Jassy enabled us to meet this rapidly increasing demand. As our demand increased and we had limited visibility into the growth, AWS was able to respond quickly by provisioning the majority of the new servers we needed, so sometimes adding several thousands a day for several days in a row. In April, our customer Oracle also showed a great support to help us. Not only did Larry Ellison record a great video to encourage our team to do the right things for the world, but also offered Oracle cloud support. We also provisioned a number of servers in the Oracle cloud as the demand for Zoom continued to increase. We are so grateful for their partnership and their responsiveness to provide capacity during this time. While the COVID-19 pandemic has expanded our market opportunities, it also brought us many challenges. Prior to the pandemic, Zoom was primarily built for and used by large enterprises and institutions. During the crisis, with good intentions, we opened our platform to unprecedented numbers of first-time users without fully considering the challenges it would bring to those who did not have full IT support, or established protocols for security and privacy like our enterprise customers. As a result, we have experienced negative price related to meeting disruption, security and privacy issues. Since these issues emerged, we have transparently and quickly addressed specific security and privacy issues, including: enacted a 90 day plan initiative on security and privacy with a weekly webinar for customers to ask me anything, acquired Keybase team to add engineering expertise to build an end-to-end encrypted meeting mode, also released Zoom 5.0 cloud with new security features and enhancements to give customers unparalleled control over their meetings and data. The new release also includes support for AES 256-bit GCM encryption and ability to report platform misuse to Zoom's Trust& Safety Team. During this period of unprecedented usage growth and negative PR, as a CEO of Zoom, I was also facing tremendous pressure. And I reached out to the high-tech community and received great support from fellow CEOs, and many of them are my mentors. And I can't thank them enough for their advice. I'm also deeply grateful to see the strong support from our valued enterprise customers, such as CEOs from Atlassian, Equinix, HubSpot, Okta, PagerDuty, Poly, SurveyMonkey and many others, both through public statements and video testimonials. With that, our users trust us to deliver the best and most secure video-first communications platform. I believe our result will continue to make us a stronger company for our customers and in the global community. Now let me discuss a few of our happy customers. We are thrilled to welcome Arm Technology to the Zoom family. Arm Technology is at the heart of a computing and data revolution that is transforming the way people live and businesses operate. In Q1, Arm chose to deploy approximately 8,000 Zoom Meeting licenses, 800 Zoom Rooms and 9,000 Zoom Phones to deliver a one-touch experience to their employees globally. We are also happy to welcome Baker McKenzie. One of Baker McKenzie's distinguished strengths is their use of cutting-edge technologies to help clients overcome the challenges of competing in today's economic world. We feel privileged to be the video communications platform of choice for the number one law firm brand in the world. Thank you, Arm and Baker McKenzie. On a final note, we welcomed Lieutenant General H.R. McMaster to serve as an independent director on Zoom's Board of Directors, Velchamy Sankarlingam as President of Engineering and Product, and Damien Hooper-Campbell as Chief Diversity Officer. Bringing their expertise to Zoom will be instrumental as we navigate rapid growth, transformation and scale. I want to commend and thank our 2,854 employees for what we have accomplished together, and for working tirelessly over the past quarter to support millions of participants around the globe. With that, let me turn things over to Kelly. By the way, I forgot to mention, today is also our CFO Kelly's birthday. So happy birthday, Kelly. Yes, I am muted. Alex, great questions. And if we have a time, I'd probably spend more time also want to get it otherwise, what's the future? But anyway, I truly believe video is a new voice. Video is going to change everything about the communication. The way for us to work, live and play is completely changed. From that perspective a huge opportunity, a lot of opportunities ahead of us. However, for now our top priority is to how to make sure we always keep our service up, because so many peoples are counting on Zoom to stay connected. Our top priority is to make sure keep the service up, double down triple down on the privacy, security issues. And also down the road, we are going to figure out where we are going to double down on the new growth areas. But for now, I think one thing we know for sure is the TAM is bigger than we saw it before right? And it's how to capture that we of the new TAM I think there's something very important. Also a lot of other new opportunities, our team are going to working together, right, to get to there, step-by-step. But now, number one thing is focus on the current product and the user experience, make sure during this pandemic crisis, hopefully it can end very soon, they can leverage Zoom to stay connected. Yes. Sterling, that's a good question. Before I answer to that question, I'd like to take a step back to share with you what's the industry standard for now, like Zoom or other competitors, because I mean, in this real-time collaboration industry for a long, long time. For now, I think most of the vendors we all use AES 256-bit either GCM or CBC, that's a standard. The reason why, if you enable end-to-end encryption, guess what, you cannot use your phone to dial in. You cannot support a traditional, old legacy, hardware [indiscernible] and SIP devices. And plus the cloud recording also is not available with some limitations. That's why for now most of the industry conferencing vendors do not support this feature. However we believe, no matter what, we needed to support that as well advance the feature. To give a customer see, your meeting is extremely sensitive. You don't want Zoom know the session key. Yet you can enable this feature with the limited functionality. It can all let the phone to dial in. And inside of that, we think this feature should be part of our offering. We do not want to charge based on the feature we try to customer more, that's not like that. So we want to give to at least the enterprise customer or business customer. Free users, for sure, we don't want to give that, right? Because we also want to work it together, see if this with FBI, with local law enforcement, in case some people they use Zoom for the better purpose, right? I think we also published a whitepaper I think a week ago right? And the opportunity to get a hub we got a lot of feedback and our team for now we're working on execution now. So I think soon we're going to know our release day. For now, we are seeing to review our whitepaper. So we have a confidence this will be a very good feature for our enterprise customers. Thank you, Sterling. You can join us as a beta tester. Yes Yes. Alex, again, that's a great question. So, even before this pandemic crisis, not only do we offer the video conferencing service, but also we have a Zoom phone system. And don't forget about that is also huge opportunity. In particular, we believe video and voice, those two are going to be key words into one service, that's a huge, huge opportunity. This pandemic crisis, I would say on the one hand, accelerated the video adoption. On the other hand, it was brand recognition, plus a lot of a prosumer, so a lot of the new use cases. Like online education, telemedicine, tele-health. For sure, we would like to double down on that. But in terms of specific opportunity on one new service, we are going to work on that in the next several months. And as I mentioned earlier, for now, we needed to make sure we still keep helping people stay connected. Another thing also, we know for sure is, the way for us to work in the future totally different and how to make sure focus on the whole new experience, right, to make sure that you have very consistent experience when you work in the office and work in the home. A lot of innovations will be upon that as well. I actually believe a lot of opportunities, but we got to be very careful. You are so right. Where we should double it down? Where we may not leave to our partners, right, to develop those applications or leverage those opportunities upon our platform. So Philip, back to your second question. So, as I mentioned earlier, we believe the video and voice those two are going to be converted into one service. Our team, we share our vision to our existing installed base, take Q1 for example. One of the very large global pharmaceutical companies, they were our heavy Zoom video conferencing customer. In Q1, they deployed a Zoom Phone, which is our largest phone deal. Around 18,000 phone licenses, right? Because they like the one consistent experience, more and more opportunity they like. Call you from a number, one more click on the upgrade video with the same experience. I think there's huge opportunity. Not to mention a lot of enterprise customers for now they still deploy on-prem and PBX solution. I think in this pandemic crisis, we helped them to accelerate their migration from on-prem to enterprise will further boost the cloud-based PBX adoption. So we think that's a huge opportunity ahead of us. Thank you. By the way, I like your -- what your background is pretty nice. Yes. I love that. I think it's a great question. My kids also use Zoom as well for their online classes. I believe, you go back to the voice, right, the voice, no matter where you're using a voice like a phone call, right? My kids and myself or in the office, on the way home at the same experience, used to be with due to Zoom, when we enable knowledge workers or business communication and collaboration. For now, given that, video conferencing is going to become a mainstream service. The boundary between the prosumers and consumers or enterprise customers is not a direct clear anymore. We got to have maintain a very consistent experience. So that's why a lot of features we build for enterprise customers can be easily similar as they used to by prosumers consumers. However, we got to make sure, right, for enterprise customers, we already have all those security features to be in, how to easily let consumers in it to enable that this is the challenge we are facing. In terms of opportunity, I do not think we needed to have a specific consumer strategy. Our strategies offer one service, no matter where you are, no matter what you do, no matter which device, it just help you to stay connected. The infrastructure services now, no internet service party cannot say, hey, you are using internet for what, for various collaboration or for consumer. It's a same thing now. That's a huge opportunity. Yes. So on the one hand, for sure we already doubled down our sales hiring by starting late last year. I think we made a very good progress in Q1, not only hunters, EPI, SDR [ph], account executive, which was quota-carrying reps, but also for the phone right? It used to be look at our videoconference service primarily driven by our direct sales team. For the phone business, it's very different. That's why we really shift our focus not only for direct sales, but also we embraced our partner program like a master agent, and really helped us a lot during the Q1. I think, we are going to do more and more on partner deals, on channel sales program or on our phone business. I think the team is working very hard on that. Thank you. Thank you, Heather. Maybe Kelly, you can address to the phone questions. I will answer to the second part of the question. So to answer to your second question, if you look at the video collaboration business, as I mentioned earlier, TAM is bigger. The add up with the phone, together, I think is also a huge market. Not to mention, we also have online business. Online business used to be a small portion of our total net MRR growth. For now, given the popularity of the video conferencing, a lot of our consumers and prosumers, they all use Zoom for online [indiscernible] on a learning teaching class, it can be used. The use case is much more broad. For sure, we can monitor that. Once you for sure we know we are not again to support advertisement model, we are not going to support that and never wanted to sell customer data. So that's something we knew for sure, we will not do it. However, in terms of how to embrace all kinds of prosumer to the use cases, I think there's a lot of ways to monetize. Online subscription, you already see the number. It's not -- as we keep the service up keep the innovation, I think we are getting more and more online buyers as well. So regarding the new services, I think the video voice, that's our company DNA. In terms of a chat message, we also have a building a chat, but also we really look at everything from customer perspective, They deployed a Slack, it's great. We have a wonderful integration with Slack, it's a great service. And a customer deploy max of teams, we also interpret integrated with max of teams very well. And so some customers, they want to spend to standardize on Zoom platform, okay, too. Our video voice, we also have a chat built in. So from that perspective, we are taking a very open flexible approach and looking at everything from a customer perspective. But overall, we are going to be laser-focused on video and voice enterprise, brilliance [ph] and consumer prosumer as well. Thank you for that. Yes. Zane, thank you. This is a great question. So, our service was built for serving enterprise customers. And we have all kinds of security features built in. Normally, we're working together with the enterprise IT team, right, to evaluate our service from a security perspective. And they are going to enable or disable those security features and we have official onboarding process. And we really understand how that process works. However during this pandemic crisis we have lots of first time users. As a CEO, I think I should have done a better job. The reason why, not only do we have our service, but also we should have played a role of IT for those first time users. In terms of enabling [indiscernible] work and meeting room or a lot of features, this is a mistake I made. So we learned a hard lesson. And that's why I said when we look at enterprise customers and consumers, there's a little bit of different obvious philosophy. For enterprise customers, just to keep any other secured features. However, for prosumers is different. Sometimes you're so right, whenever there's a treat of a conflict that's why we doubled down our security. We want to leverage this opportunity to completely transform our business to be the most secured solution. However, if there's a conflict between the privacy security versus usability, I think the privacy security is more important than usability. Like a three clicks, yes, customer may not like it, they want to two clicks. But if there's a privacy issue, yes, we still want to have three clicks. So that's why, however and we do have a team, we review every use case, every feature, we want to make sure focus on the privacy security. At the same time, do all we can lose the ease of use; that's also critical. So, that's why we hired a lot of security researchers, engineers to make sure on the one hand, we are very secure, safe to use, on the other hand, also how to balance. This is an ongoing effort, we are committed. Yes, good question. So yes, we already announced the partnership with Dropbox before, recently also, partnership with Box as well, with a seamless integration. We also support Microsoft Drive, Google Drive as well, essentially, within the meeting interface, you want to share the files from those cloud providers. I think, overall, we are focused on the customer experience. As I mentioned earlier, video and the voice is still critical to our business in the future. So for now, we just want to integrate, interoperate with other best of breed service providers. Thank you. Yes, sorry. I lost for several seconds. Pressed going back conduct the meeting. Yes. So you look at a competitive landscape, I think this pandemic crisis does not change anything. And we are still laser-focused video. And also we have a phone service. Pick, for sure, the market opportunity is much bigger than before now, right? You take a Ring Central for an example. They were focusing on the phone service, which was on video, we added a Cloud PBX, they added a video conferencing. We will put a pattern but for now, the market is bigger. I would say any competition is always good for consumers, right? And so, if there's no competitors, there's any use. So we are okay, so we do everything from end user perspective. Yes. It's too early to tell. But overall, I truly believe the best of breed service provider will survive and thrive, because customer -- when it comes to the video and voice, you got to make it work anytime, everywhere, any device. It's not that easy. Otherwise, the reason why during this pandemic crisis in the customer trust Zoom, to use Zoom because it just works. And the quality and a lot of innovations. And that's why I think, video and voice it's not that easy. If you can do the basic service with all the basic features, okay, but to make it work in 7/24, with no any outages and also focus on innovation it's not that straightforward. And that's why I think as long as we keep working harder, really listening our customers to be the first vendor understand their pinpoint, understand their use case, to be their first vendor to come up with a solution. Even if we have so many competitors, I think we're okay, because, again, this is a huge market opportunity. So we may not kind of serve every customer, but as long as we keep listening to our customers keep the innovation, I think we should be okay. By the way James, those 300 million meeting participants is -- that's just a meeting participants -- the number is not a unique. If you're joining five times in a day, we'll be counting five, right, from free users or paid users. So Kelly, right on. So it had to add on to what Kelly said. If you look at a phone as a separate or service, you're so right. Especially, during this pandemic, I have a cellphone number why do I needed to deploy another service, do not make any sense. However, if you think the phone is part of the video. Now phone and the video the same thing, the same service, you will know that the growth will follow as well. This is our vision. We are seeing the phone as the voice, the same thing, the same product, same service the same back, and the same experience. That's why we see the huge opportunity. If you want to sell our phone service as a separate service it's not a part of video conference service. You're still right. There's no reason for us to deploy a separate service, just the same phone number. What's the point? That's why I think we have a huge opportunity because of architecture, because of the phone and Zoom Video, the same service. So that's a very different. Thank you. Yes. And by the way, we offer a free service to more than 100,000 K-12 schools around the globe. And, I think you're so right, after the summer, are they going to keep using zoom for online classes or what we should do? I think that's we're going to work on that. But for now we just to have those K-12 schools and because primarily we are focused on the high-ad before and now we have more and more K-12 schools. That's very different again. And also Tom, during this pandemic crisis, our top priority is to show our corporate social responsibility. Essentially, we do all we can to have people stay connected at no cost. We even look at, hey, if you had a several thousand servers, what's the cost look like this, no don't worry about that. This is time to help people stay connected. But down the road, after the pandemic crisis its sort of ended soon, I think for sure we are going to go back to our the gross margin focus. Thank you, Tom. Yes. I want to say just, thank you all, thank you every Zoom employees, thank you all the users, customers, thank you for your trust. Thank you for our shareholders. And we will do all we can to truly deliver happiness to you. We will not let you down. Thank you for the support and I the truly appreciate it."

And now, I will have things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Tom.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Kelsey. Hello everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the fourth quarter and full year of FY22. I\u2019m joined today by Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan; and Zoom\u2019s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.com. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the first quarter and full year 2023, our expectations regarding financial and business trends, our market position, opportunities, growth strategy and business aspirations, product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives and our stock repurchase program. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we make on today's webinar. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Tom. Before I begin, I want to welcome Bill McDermott, CEO of ServiceNow, who will join our Board of Directors tomorrow. I look forward to working with Bill, a visionary in the technology space and a successful software executive. I\u2019d also like to thank Bart Swanson, who is stepping down from our Board of Directors tomorrow, for his years of service on our Board, and wish him the best in his future endeavors. Let me also thank our global Zoom team, customers, partners, and investors for their support as we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of our inception and three-year anniversary of our IPO. Now, I'd like to share with you three key pillars of the Zoom strategy, which we are building out to drive future growth: The first pillar is really about being a full unified communications platform. We made enormous strides over the past several years evolving from a meetings company into a multi-product platform, including video conferencing, events, chat, phone, and more. The missing piece was the contact center, that was until our announcement last week. More on that in a moment. The second pillar is hybrid work. Because we believe hybrid work is going to become more flexible and less about location. No matter where you are - office, traveling, or home - Zoom wants to make sure you have a consistent experience. Whether with Zoom Rooms or on a Zoom-connected device, we want to make sure you're part of the conversation and able to collaborate, anywhere and everywhere. The third pillar is business workflows and how we leverage our API marketplace, our Zoom Apps, and our SDK. Many technology companies tell me that they want to integrate Zoom into their platform to improve the communication and collaboration experience for their customers. For instance, we recently announced a Zoom-DocuSign integration. This will allow customers to review a document during a Zoom Meeting and approve it as part of a simple bi-directional business workflow. We are in the early innings of this transformation of work and communication. We believe there is a massive opportunity, and we plan to address it with the same level of innovation, scalability, and simplicity that has made Zoom the trusted platform for hundreds of thousands of businesses around the world. As a key part of our UC stack, I am super excited about the announcement we made last week. We announced the general availability of Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel customer engagement solution that is optimized for video and integrated right into the Zoom client. It brings unified communications together with modern contact center capabilities, helps customers connect over video, and also supports channels like voice, SMS, and webchat. Zoom Contact Center is simple for admins to configure and deploy. They can easily create menus, greetings, and prompts right in the Zoom Admin portal. The product can also integrate chat and video into an existing digital presence, like a website, helping organizations have conversations with customers in the right place and at the right time. This is just the beginning of our plan to modernize the contact center and enrich the experience for our customer and our customer\u2019s customer. Speaking of customers, we ended the year with a lot of great wins. First, I want to thank Medtronic, a global leader in healthcare technology, for expanding their partnership with Zoom. In 2020, Medtronic chose Zoom Meetings, Zoom Rooms, and Zoom Webinars to enable its global employees to communicate and collaborate better. In Q4 of FY22, after a careful vendor selection process, they decided to add 60,000 Zoom Phone licenses to a new multi-year agreement. Thank you Medtronic for trusting Zoom to deliver a modern, integrated UCaaS solution to support your global communications needs. Thank you Intuit, the global technology platform that makes TurboTax, QuickBooks, Mint, Credit Karma and Mailchimp, for entrusting Zoom with their video communications over the past few years and recently adding Zoom Phone to create a unified communications platform across their organization. Thank you Arizona State University, which was recently recognized by U.S. News & World Report as the country\u2019s most innovative school, and has been a strong supporter of Zoom products over the years. As a leading research university, a highly effective communications platform is important to drive collaboration between their students, staff and community. ASU chose Zoom to be a complete communications platform with 50,000 Zoom Meetings, 700 Zoom Rooms, and 15,000 Zoom Phone licenses as well as Zoom Webinars. I also want to recognize LIXIL Group Corporation, a Japanese manufacturer and pioneer of building materials and housing equipment. As a Zoom Meetings and Zoom Rooms customer, LIXIL has embraced hybrid work for communication and collaboration while leveraging the ease of use of the Zoom platform to enhance their customer experience with video tours of their showrooms. In Q4, LIXIL added 10,000 Zoom Phone licenses, committing to a unified communication platform. Thank you Medtronic, Intuit, Arizona State, and LIXIL. I am so grateful to have such a great group of customers. The world wants a full communications platform; one that is integrated with other workflows, supports hybrid work, and is secure and easy to use. Zoom is hard at work ensuring our customers exceed the soaring expectations of how businesses collaborate internally and communicate externally. To sustain and enhance our leadership position in this new era of digital transformation, we plan in FY \u201823 to build out our platform to further enrich the customer experience and expand our go-to-market motions, which will enable us to drive future growth for Zoom.  I want to thank our Zoomies for their hard work over the past 10 years. We have grown to nearly 6,800 strong and are more focused than ever on delivering happiness every day to our hundreds of thousands of customers around the world. And with that, then let me pass it over to Kevin. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. Let me start with a few of the financial highlights for FY '22 and the results for Q4, then provide our outlook for Q1 and FY '23. We delivered another year of strong results. Revenue grew 55% to $4.1 billion as we exited FY '22 at an annualized run rate of $4.29 billion. We grew non-GAAP operating margin to 40.4%, up from 37.1% in FY '21 as we scale our operations. And we achieved an adjusted free cash flow margin of 38%. In Q4, total revenue grew 21% year-over-year to $1.07 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $1.053 billion. The growth was primarily driven by strength in our enterprise business, which continued to grow significantly faster than our online business. We also saw strong demand for Zoom Phone, which had a record quarter, adding over 550,000 paid seats. Much of the Zoom Phone growth came from strength in large customers with a number of customers with more 149% year-over-year, and the number of customers with more than 10,000 paid seats growing 122% year-over-year. We also added a major global bank as a Zoom Phone customer. We saw 66% year-over-year growth in the upmarket as we ended the year with 2,725 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represented 23% of revenue, up from 18% in Q4 of last year. We exited the quarter with approximately 509,800 customers with more than 10 employees, up 9% year-over-year. In Q4, customers with more than 10 employees represented 67% of revenue, up from 63% in Q4 of last year.  As we approach our three-year anniversary as a public company, a lot of incredible things have occurred at Zoom. We\u2019ve seen unprecedented growth and brand awareness for Zoom Meetings and incredibly strong momentum for newer products. We have also expansively built out our direct, channel, and ISV go-to-market motions, which we collectively call Enterprise. These customers have high lifetime values as they tend to increase deployments, extend terms, and churn at much lower rates over time. Starting today, we will provide metrics that more closely align with the way our internal view of the business has evolved following this period of unprecedented growth and expansion. This will include the number of Enterprise customers and the Net Dollar Expansion rate for Enterprise customers. In the appendix of the investor deck you will find two-years of historical data for these new metrics. Additionally, through the end of FY \u201823, we will continue to provide the number of customers with more than 10 employees in the appendix. In Q4, the number of enterprise customers grew 35% year-over-year to approximately 191,000. Revenue from enterprise customers grew 38% year-over-year and represented 50% of total revenue, up from 44% in Q4 FY '21. We expect revenue from enterprise customers become increasingly higher percentage of total revenue over time. Our Online business, which we define as customers self-serviced through our online channel, represents the other half of our revenue, up from approximately 25% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, before the pandemic. The self-service model is very attractive from profitability and cash flow perspectives. And while we have seen online grow more slowly than enterprise in recent quarters and expect that to continue going forward, we are continuing to invest in and innovate around this channel to drive growth. We will also be presenting our Net Dollar Expansion rate for Enterprise customers rather than our Net Dollar Expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees. First, let me start with the historic metric; our Q4 Net Dollar Expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees was in line with what we discussed in Q3, being just under 130% at 129%. Going forward, we will report the trailing twelve month Net Dollar Expansion rate for Enterprise customers, which in Q4 was 130%. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Our Americas revenue grew 21% year over year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew 23% year over year to be approximately 33% of revenue, stable with Q4 of last year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Asia Pacific revenue grew slightly faster than the overall company, but we saw headwinds to our online business in EMEA, partially associated with the holiday seasonality. Let me share a few international highlights with you. We closed our largest overall deal ever in EMEA with 200,000 meetings licenses, and our largest Zoom Rooms deal in APAC with a customer deploying more than 3,300 Zoom Rooms to drive hybrid work across their offices. We have also expanded our partnership with Deutsche Telekom by committing to developing a joint solution specifically for the German market. We continue to view international expansion as a major opportunity for future growth. Now turning to profitability, which was strong from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, income tax benefits from discrete activities, and undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 78.3%, an improvement from 71.3% in Q4 of last year and 76.0% in Q3 of this year. The sequential improvement was mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers as well as the seasonally lower usage during the holidays. We expect this figure to return to the mid-seventies in the short-term, before improving in the mid to long-term, as we continue to build out our data centers. Research and development expense grew by 133% year over year to approximately $72 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense nearly doubled year over year to 6.7%, demonstrating our commitment to innovation and product development. We plan to further invest to enhance our platform, including our recently announced contact center product. Sales and marketing expense grew by 58% year-over-year to $251 million or approximately 23.4% of total revenue, primarily driven by increased marketing programs and sales headcount to drive future growth. We remain committed to investing in worldwide sales capacity and platform. G&A expense grew by 22% to $95 million or approximately 8.9% of total revenue. Non-GAAP operating income expanded to $420 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $363 million. This translates to a 39.2% non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 compared with a 40.9% a year ago and 39.1% last quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 grew to $1.29 on approximately 306 million non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding. This result is $0.22 above the high end of our guidance and $0.07 above Q4 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. The deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.2 billion, up 34% year-over-year from $883 million. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $2.6 billion, up 51% year-over-year from $1.7 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 63% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 70% in Q4 of last year, reflecting a shift back towards longer-term plan. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of renewals being front-end loaded and tapering through the year, our collections followed the same trend. Since our renewal linearity is unique, let me provide you once again with some color on next quarter's deferred revenue. We believe it will peak in Q1 at 12% to 13% year-over-year growth and moderate over the rest of the year, reflecting the smaller renewal rates.  We ended the quarter with approximately $5.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $209 million as compared to $399 million in Q4 of last year. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes a onetime $85 million cash outflow related to a legal settlement that we disclosed and recognized as a GAAP expense in Q1 was $274 million as compared to $378 million in Q4 of last year. Now turning to our FY '23 guidance. This outlook is consistent with what we are observing in the market today. Specifically, it assumes that our enterprise business will grow substantially faster than our online business. It also assumes that our year-over-year total revenue growth rate will modestly accelerate in late FY '23. For the first quarter of FY '23, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.07 billion to $1.075 billion. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $345 million to $350 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.86 to $0.88 based on approximately 309 million shares outstanding. As mentioned last quarter, due to our multiyear history of profitability, we have fully utilized our NOLs. We expect our tax rate to approximate the U.S. blended tax rate in FY '23. For the full year of FY '23, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.53 billion to $4.55 billion, which would represent approximately 11% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $1.43 billion to $1.45 billion, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 32%. While our revenue grew 558% from FY '20 to FY '22, our operating margin also increased from 14% to 40%. We are pursuing a massive opportunity, and we will continue to focus on the appropriate balance between growth and margins as we build out and deliver on the potential of our platform. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $3.45 to $3.51 based on approximately 312 million shares outstanding. As indicated in our earnings press release today, our Board has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program that we intend to execute on beginning this quarter. This not only underscores the confidence that our Board and our management team have in the future of Zoom, but also allows us to leverage our strong profitability, cash flow generation and strength of our balance sheet to deliver returns back to our shareholders. We are excited about the large and growing opportunity ahead of us as we continue to execute on our strategy and growth outlook. As always, Zoom is grateful to be a driving force, enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless and secure communications platform. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community and our investors. Kelcey, please queue up our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Kelly and Eric, you're coming up on the anniversary date of COVID and close to the renewal date that a lot of your customers are going to have. So can you just speak to some of the trends you're seeing? We're just trying to get a sense of is this a good Phone entry point? Are you seeing normalization of kind of room attack rates? Or what are you seeing as far as video license we need licenses? Just any trends that you're seeing as one of these major renewals kind of come up at the end of this month and into the next one?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Thank you, Meta. So we continue to see strength in our renewals, especially in the enterprise business. And as you heard from some of the highlights we talked about earlier, we had a very strong performance from Zoom Phone in Q4 as well and also Zoom Rooms as customers are really thinking about the future of hybrid work and how they're going to keep everyone collect connected as they bring them back to the office. This is a really important strategy for them. And you heard Eric talk about some of that, and maybe Eric sets on the strategy around that, but continue to see strength both in renewals in the enterprise as well as additional Phone seats and Zoom Rooms.\nMeta Marshall: Got it. That's it for me. I mean just in terms of maybe just another quick question in terms of what kind of metrics you're looking at as you make some of these sales and marketing investments to just determine what return you're going to see on those? Or what benchmarks you're kind of measuring yourself against that? And that's it for me.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. I mean one of the key things we always look at internally is sales productivity, looking at it both from a U.S. and an international perspective. And then on the marketing side, we look at internally. We also look at things like opportunities and leads that get generated from any of those. And then, of course, maybe the external benchmark, we're always looking at is sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue.\nOperator: Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo has the next question.\nMichael Turrin : I was hoping to ask one on contact center. And just some more detail, can you help just frame out initial observations around positioning? Is there a certain size contact center you're targeting? Are there advantages you see with Zoom Video? Or lessons learned from having Phone in the market you would point to? And just in terms of the go-to-market motion, how different is that? Or how well geared are you from some of those initial conversations?\nEric Yuan: Hey, Michael, that is a great question. We are super excited about our contact center announcement of last week. And first of all, this is based on our customers' feedback. Several years ago, after the launch of Zoom Phone, many of our customers told us they would like to standardize on Zoom platform for unified communications. The only missing piece is contact center. We listen to our customers, our team is working so hard and finally, we've announced the Zoom Contact Center.  But in terms of growth, similar to what we did to grow our Zoom Phone business, right? For the first year, for sure, right, we are going to target those customers who really want to standardize on Zoom platform, probably started from Meeting, for those customers who deploy both Meeting and Phone, now they look at the contact center. Also at the same time, we are working very hard at more and more features. I think probably for those customers as long as they want to embrace the cloud business content center, as long as they want to standardize on Zoom unified communication platform, who would like to targeted to, right? And that's our strategy. And that's omnichannel, Video and it's very strong. We also support SMS, voice and web chat. Again, a lot of hard work, and we are going to continue innovating. And to drive our Zoom Contact Center growth. And based on the early data feedback, our customers are also very excited. They wanted to deploy a solution and really understand the unified collaboration. Also at the same time, we build this solution from ground up, right? And very consistent competitor Video and Phone, we're very excited about this opportunity.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty: Hopefully you can hear me okay, given the wind noise. But Kelly, I didn't quite hear Meta's question. I was just wondering, within the guidance for this coming year, can you give us a sense what the enterprise growth specifically looks like within that guide?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So specifically, in enterprise, we expect that part of our business to grow at approximately 20% year-over-year. And then that you can back into that what we're expecting from our online business is for it to be flattish for the year, but it might have some variability quarter-over-quarter.\nEric Yuan: Yes, Sterling, by the way, our enterprise growth is pretty strong as we add more and more new services like contact center is first one, right? We are not going to stop here. This is our company being who truly understand the enterprise customer need. We are going to add more and more enterprise services to further grow our enterprise business.\nOperator: Jim Fish with Piper Sandler has the next question.\nQuinton Gabrielli: This is Quinton on for Jim Fish. The labor market right now remains difficult, especially as you're looking to hire and retain some of the top engineering and sales talent. Can you talk about any changes or impacts you've seen in Zoom's ability to maintain your top talent? And then how you plan on differentiating and acquiring this new talent?\nEric Yuan: Yes, Kelly, feel free to chime in. So James, you were right on, given the great resignation, right, it's pretty challenging, right, across the industry, right? And again, we always double down our company culture, and this is extremely important for us, right? How to make sure we deliver happiness to our customers. My number 1 priority is really think about our employees how to make sure our employees are happy, right? We are doing so many things to really help our employees. And also, again, over the past 2 years, we more than probably tripled the size of the company, right? Many employees is drawn to Zoom remotely. Again, that's not easy, but good news soon is going to change. Especially if you look at our remote employees, how to make sure offer the flexibility and also make sure support our employees' needs by always set the feedback from our employees. We also have a happiness crew, always trying to understand what's the pain point of whatever we can do differently to think of an employee. By doing that, I'm pretty sure, and we are going to make sure I'm pretty happy, and we'll be okay. And that's always our formula.\nOperator: Moving on to Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron: Kelly, I have a couple of questions for you. First, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you're looking for reacceleration in the second half of the year. Maybe can you walk us through the kind of the puts and takes and what's behind that assumption? And the second question will be regarding the online business. I know you're only giving expansion rate, the dollar base expansion rate on the enterprise side. But given that online is still 50% of your revenue, can you at least give us kind of a rough range of where online net dollar expansion rate typically falls just so we get a sense of how to model that out?\nKelly Steckelberg: So in terms of the second half acceleration, you're looking at in the upmarket or the enterprise, I should say now. It will be driven largely by continued expansion and growth in our existing customers as well as contribution from some of our new products that we're really excited about, including contact center. And then in the online business, what you're going to see is maybe we talked about at Analyst Day last year, how once those cohorts get to a certain age of [16] months and older, there's a lot of stability that comes with those retention rates. By the time we get to the second half of this year, all of those cohorts that we acquired during the pandemic are going to have hit that cycle. So it's really going to start to bring stability to the online business in a way that we haven't seen historically. And then in terms of the net dollar expansion rate to the online, we won't be disclosing that. So in other words, I think the best I can give you is based on what Sterling just asked, which is, what's the growth rate for that business? And as I mentioned, we expect it to be flattish for next year with some variability quarter-over-quarter.\nOperator: Baird's William Power has the next question.\nWilliam Power: Great to see the strong Zoom Phone numbers again. I guess I'd love to get more color around the key drivers there. It sounds like particularly upmarket. How are you competing there? What have been kind of the key differentiators? So just trying to understand growth within existing customers versus landing new customers and I guess it's a multipart, but first, where does distribution stand? I mean, how important has that been expanding distribution? How much further is there to go using the channel, et cetera?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So that's -- yes, it's a great question. Actually, Q4 was a record quarter, right, in terms of number of new seats, more than 0.5 million, if I recall correctly, around 550,000 newly added seats for Zoom Phone. I think the first one, not only for our existing customers, but also for new customers as well because of trust we build established with our customers over the past several years, and customers think about how to transform their business to fully embrace digital transformation, how to migrate their on-prem phone system to the cloud. They always want to deploy the best solution. Plus most of the customers already deployed the Video content solution and also they want to have 1 consistent experience. That front-end experience is very consistent, the back-end also is very consistent. And plus very reliable and ease of use, security and also a lot of cool features. And that's the reason why customers they want to deploy the Zoom Phone. As long as a customer, they win us through the win their selection process, we have high confidence.  Look at Intuit, look at the Medtronic. It's not 1,000 of licenses, that's a 10,000 licenses, right? And again, that business still -- we'll continue doing very well. And also, we are not going to stop here. We'll add more and more features, more innovations, plus combined with the contact center. We do see the accelerated growth for both the Phone and also our Contact Center down the road.\nOperator: We'll now hear from Ryan Koontz with Needham\nRyan Koontz: I want to ask about your business workflow strategy there, Eric. And for your API and SDK, what type of applications are you using that for? Typically, is this primarily tech companies? Any color there would be helpful.\nEric Yuan: Hey, Ryan, that's a really great question. Looking at our growth strategy, right? 3 things, 3 pillars, right? An unified communication platform, we just added contact center, we're going to add more and more. The second pillar really about the hybrid work. The third one is extremely important, which is business workflow platform, right? And we have SDK, some healthcare customers and they would like to embed SDK into their telemedicine, telehealth offering, we have API also marketplace. But the most important thing is really about the Zoom Apps, right? We just announced a Zoom-DocuSign integration. Essentially, during the meeting time, it's very easy. In 1 click, I look at a document, I can approve that. More and more integration like that. Giving a meeting time or all site meeting time as well, right? And that's the key for our -- the platform growth. And another reason why we invited a great leader and CEO of ServiceNow, right, join our Board, right? ServiceNow is probably the best workflow application provider, right? How to learn from ServiceNow? How to embed more and more other business workflow applications to the Zoom platform and also vice versa. I think that can truly help our customers, right? Rather than they leave the Zoom interface, go to other business context, right, they can stay within the Zoom interface, can get the job done, right? Also, we are doubling down our SDK platform, right? Like education, healthcare, a lot of vertical industries, start up, they would like to embed zoom to their offering. That's why we are very excited about our business workflow platform.\nOperator: Brad Sills with Bank of America has the next question.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Mike on for Brad Sills, if I could. So first on your churn by cohort. I love to hear your thoughts and the assumptions around that. And then second, the visibility into the attach rate for contact center.\nKelly Steckelberg: Sure. So Brad, if you -- or Mike, sorry, if you remember back in Analyst Day last fall, we shared a chart that shows how as cohorts age, when they get to that 16 months and older, they really stabilize in terms of retention rates. And if you go back and look at that, you're able to see what we shared with not only the retention rates, but also where we are in that aging process. And so it's very easy for us now to look forward and predict how those retention rates are going to impact the overall base of that -- of the online business. And so that's exactly what we've assumed. They just continue aging because we've seen really strong stability in those retention rates as they get to that 15 to 16 months age. So it hasn't changed even as the business has kind of overall volatile, it doesn't change in those order of things. So we're just following that along.\nUnidentified Analyst: And then the assumption to the attachment rate for the contact center?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So we -- it's still early right now. We have -- we haven't done it in terms of attach rate yet. We just look forward to the back half of this year and assume that we start to see some revenue there. We saw really -- we had many really strong enterprise customers sign up for the beta. So we're excited to see how it goes.\nOperator: Matt VanVliet with BTIG has the next question.\nMatthew VanVliet: I guess as you look at the many investments you made on the international side of things, where do you feel like you are, from a sales force maturity, and efficiency relative to a lot of the efficiencies you've already shown in the U.S.? And just as each of those markets mature, maybe any kind of regional or country by country specifics would be great.\nKelly Steckelberg: So the international team has grown tremendously over the last few years. We certainly continue to see opportunity. And we talked about this before, but as a quick reminder, with the growth and the brand awareness over the last few years, it's really enabled us to go in and put reps where we see opportunities without having to see markets with marketing dollars. I think the big area of opportunity that still is for us internationally is the channel. That is where we -- there's a cross-functional initiative in the company to really focus on the channel, especially focused around on Phone, and that can be master agents that can be carriers, Deutsche Telekom and our strong partnership there, we just announced, is a great example of that effort. And we're going to continue to focus especially over this next coming year because that's a really important part of the distribution strategy for Zoom Phone.\nOperator: And Matthew Niknam with Deutsche question.\nMatthew Niknam: You've talked about M&A being a greater part of the story going forward. I'm just wondering with the pullback in market valuations for some higher growth themes, how are you thinking about inorganic opportunities? And are you seeing more of these opportunity surface, particularly in the private market? And then maybe if I can just sneak in a follow-up. On the customers with more than 10 employees, I believe that declined slightly sequentially. Just wondering if there's any color you can give in terms of maybe what drove the bulk of those departures in terms of customer size?\nKelly Steckelberg: Sure. So in terms of inorganic and the open for M&A, we really are continuing to be focused on this. And I think, the strength of our balance sheet in terms of cash leaves us a lot of opportunity regardless of what's happening with our stock price, honestly. So we will continue to focus on opportunities for augmenting talent or technology, which is what we've said all along. And then in terms of the decline in the -- you are right, it was slightly down, the customers with greater than 10 employees. And you -- back up for just a quick minute, remember that when we went public, we picked that metric as a proxy for our direct business and that customers with fewer than 10 was the proxy for our online segment. And what's happened over time as we've seen this tremendous growth in online as a channel, it started to kind of overlap there, which is why we don't think it's really the appropriate metric to use any longer going forward. But that decline was driven by churn that we saw in the Online segment of our business with customers that have more than 10 employees.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Matt, to add on to what Kelly said, I think it's time to really look at the online business and also our direct business, driven by sales channel. An online business, meaning those customers never interacted with our sales rep, right, just to go online to use their credit card to buy. I think that's probably the best -- it's the right time for us. Look at the online business and also direct channel business, right, rather than just 10 employee -- because it's still a little bit confusing, right? Sometimes you also talk to our sales rep, sometimes go on and to buy. And it's time for us to look at the pure online business, meaning they never interact with our sales rep, right? I think that's a better rate, the better metrics down the road.\nOperator: Peter Levine has the next question with Evercore.\nPeter Levine : So maybe just to piggyback off the contact center discussion. I think it's been reported that you're selling seats at $70 per month per agent. So that's obviously a huge discount from the industry average, call it, $200. So is the pricing an indication that Zoom just doesn't have all the features, functionality? Or/and it just doesn't warrant the premium price? Or it\u2019s just that Zoom being aggressive is just trying to get market share? And I would assume -- my second part of my question is, I would assume, over time, the idea is to get the full blown functionality, AI, is it [WHL] and kind of move that pricing up to kind of where the industry is today?\nKelly Steckelberg: So Peter, I would say that Zoom has always been disruptive in pricing and contact center is absolutely different. If you look across the market in how we price Meetings, how we price in Phone, we introduced it. We're approximately half the price of any of our competitors' list price. And that continues to be the case with contact center as well. I mean, over time, we absolutely will continue to add features and functionality with exact same approach that we took for Zoom Phone in terms of the launch and how it grew over time and expanded the features and functionality. The same is true with Contact Center. But you should not take the price as reflecting anything in terms of the quality of that product.\nEric Yuan: Yes, Peter, Kelly is right on. Our growth strategy always better product, better price and also much better service.\nOperator: Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities has the next question.\nShebly Seyrafi: So with your guidance for fiscal '23, it looks like you're guiding for about 11%-or-so revenue growth. In my model to fit your bottom line guidance, I'm getting around 40% OpEx growth, it's like 4x your revenue growth. And that's an unusual kind of multiple like 4 to 1. And usually, that's indicative of a company's belief that they could grow fast, meaning like 20% plus in the future. So my question really is, is the goal here to invest way ahead of your expected revenue growth in '23 with the idea of accelerating your revenue growth to 20%-plus at some point in the future? And related to this, I know you're guiding for online being flattish this year. Is your goal to get that to at least double-digit growth in the future?\nKelly Steckelberg: So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, Shebly, we absolutely expect there to be an inflection point and for revenue to start to reaccelerate in the back half of the year. We're not yet -- we're not prepared to give multiyear guidance at this point. But what you should expect is we're modeling for the exit growth rate to be higher than the full year growth rate for FY '23.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Just quickly, prior to pandemic, our growth strategy is very clear, right? Double down on enterprise; every 2 years, we're going to introduce a new service, right? To really add mobile, right? Also upsell. Over the past 2 years, we have to really think about how to help the world and help people stay connected. That's the reason why we spend a lot of time to make sure I offer the K-12 school free services also and focus on online business as well. Right now, we're seeing end of COVID crisis, right, we got to go back, double down our enterprise growth strategy. Also, at the same time, we have to adjust our previous enterprise growth strategy, which is every 2 years, you are to add a new service. Now probably every 1 year, you need to add 1 more new services, right? That's a way for us. That's the reason why we adjust our growth strategy, right, to double down, triple down our enterprise customers.\nOperator: I'm moving on to Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Kelly and Eric, the EMEA and APAC growth has been a big part of the Zoom story as the U.S. market has become more penetrated yet. In this past quarter, the growth in both those regions decelerated pretty sharply. Kelly, I know you talked a little bit about seasonality in Europe. Do you mind elaborating on what's happening in international? And when you set your 11% growth target, what's embedded in that number in terms of your non-U.S. growth even if you can be directional?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So in Q4, we did see -- we saw strength in Asia Pac, and we even saw strength in EMEA, too. As you remember, we announced our largest deal ever for EMEA, which is super exciting. So strength in the enterprise segment of the business. But we absolutely saw an impact from holiday seasonality, which we expected. We talked about that in the call on Q3 as you remember.  In terms of looking forward, international absolutely is a really important part of our growth strategy, and we do continue to expect it to grow at a rate that is higher than the U.S. And so that's -- and we will continue to also add -- invest in sales capacity internationally at a rate that is higher on a percentage basis than we would be doing in the U.S. as well.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: I wanted to go back to, look, I appreciate the new reporting -- way of reporting things. I think it makes a lot more sense. But just when we think about the above 10 and sub-10 employee segment, it was down sequentially again, but it's actually slightly up versus Q1 and up year-over-year. How is this relative to your own expectations? And how should we be thinking about that segment going forward? And maybe alongside that, when we see these above 10 employee customer count down sequentially, I know a big chunk of those are online customers, totally makes sense. Based on your observations, what are you seeing those customers doing? Are they unplugging? Are they moving to a competitor? Or are they just downgrading to a free version of Zoom? And maybe there's a monetization opportunity down the line?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. I mean it's -- so in terms of like this is why this number doesn't make sense anymore because it's gotten so mixed up between the customers and the channel. I think the size of the customers and the channel, that's what gotten really unconvoluted with this metric going forward and why we're not going to really talk about it going forward. So in terms of how we see it going forward, honestly, Rishi, we aren't even modeling around this metric any longer. We are completely moving to thinking about enterprise and online because as I said in the prepared remarks, that really reflects how we think about the business and how we are measuring and managing that's what makes the most sense. And what you should really continue to see is ongoing growth in the enterprise business. We're super excited about the strength that we see there and double-digit growth for next year. And that online is going to be flattish, and that's what we expect. In terms of what these customers are doing, we -- especially in the smaller customers, we see them -- we even come back, we even come back, right? We make it very flexible for them to do that. And so at any point in time, they might be taking a break, but they might come back when it makes sense for them. And that's what we want. We want it to be easy for them to come and go as they see the need for our products.\nOperator: And we will now hear from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Kelly, I wanted to ask you just a couple of points on the FY '23 outlook. I guess, first, how are you thinking about price increases and just generally pricing power philosophically? And then second of all, the reported revenue this quarter relative to your guide was some of the smallest upside we've seen as a public company. So just any changes in guidance philosophy? Or how you're approaching the guide for this year would be helpful.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. In terms of the outlook on pricing perspective, we currently don't have plans to increase our prices across the board. We are especially for the online segment of our business, we are looking at opportunities for localized pricing and selling in local currency, which I think will be really helpful in terms of especially some of the smaller customers in those markets, and getting those plans rightsized to those markets. But no plans to increase our prices across the board. And then in terms of the beats that you were mentioning for as we've grown and scaled as a business, I think you're starting to see our guidance and our beat get more correlated to the size of the business and reflects the growth rates that we're experiencing going forward.\nOperator: Moving on to Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAleksandr Zukin: I've got just a competition one and then a numbers one. So Eric, maybe for you first. Given the increasing importance of the enterprise business, the increasing spend there, the product diversification, what's the right way to think about this post-pandemic competitive environment vis-a-vis Microsoft as well as your other competitors? Is it the same sales cycles, longer? More -- give us a flavor of what you're seeing and how you're planning for the full year?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So again, Alex, that\u2019s comms competition, right? We always focus on -- really focus on our customers, right? And so it's easy to piggyback and double down on innovation. That's pretty much -- that is the formula, it\u2019s very sustainable. But however, if we would really just focus on some of our competitors, I would say, first of all -- and you take Microsoft for example, right? And in some enterprise customers they have standardized on Microsoft. Some enterprise customers are standardized on Zoom platform. For some enterprise customers, you look at [Okta] billions in report, right? And look at the [Okta\u2019s] Microsoft Office 365 deployment. In terms of coexistence, between Zoom -- and Zoom, that percentage is increasing year-over-year around [45%], right? Meaning all those [Okta] and Microsoft Office 365 customers need to deploy both Zoom and Microsoft solution, right? And also, we also on many fronts, we partner with Microsoft as well, right? I think that's why the market is huge, right? And some customers realize the Zoom platform, great. They like Microsoft Chat, yes. They deployed a Zoom Video and Voice. But I think that will continue. Also, at the same time, right? Like we added a contact center, we are going to add more and more new services, right? In addition to focus on horizontal collaboration platform, we also want to focus on more value-added like contact center and also some other services as well, right? And by doing that, on the right hand, we compete against some of those bigger competitors; on the other hand, it also integrate more and more with them as well, right? That's our strategy. Yes.\nAleksandr Zukin: Got it. And then Kelly, so I just want to go back to the point that Sterling asked about the guidance with respect to enterprise versus online, the 20% and flat. Just help us bridge that to where billings guidance for Q1 is negative, billings guidance for the full year, I think pencils out to low single digits. CRPO sequentially decelerated. What's the -- like what is the number we should focus on the forward-looking metric to give us confidence in that reacceleration of revenue growth that you're calling for? And particularly, the sustainability on some of the enterprise and online trends?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So remember that, unfortunately, billings is not a good forward-looking metric. And it's due to the fact that we have this split in our business. And the enterprise business is -- the billings associated with that are what you would expect in a normal SaaS business, and they're multiyear -- annual to multiyear. In the online business, it is not. But there are many of those customers that are still buying and pay on a monthly basis. So it really doesn't make sense for a metric, and that's why you're going to continue to see volatility in that metric. And because of that, I think what we've tried to give you was at least some color around deferred revenue. So you can understand that because also the seasonality and the linearity that we have in our renewals and our billings. Unfortunately, the best that I have to give you is our revenue guidance, and that's it. We're trying to give you metrics that better reflect now how we think about that.\nOperator: We'll now hear from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nTom McCallum: Hey, Eric, before Kash jumps on here, I just wanted to let you know, Kash, unfortunately, was on the participant side. So we just pulled him in as a panelist, but he used our Zoom Chat product to come on over. So welcome to the world of Zoom Chat.\nKasthuri Rangan: So Eric, I think 2022 is a year of transition, right? I was really intrigued by something you said back in September, how you are positioning Zoom for the next era of communications. You have a lot of products in the product road map, the video exchange center and you have the event platform, et cetera. I'm curious to see -- to get your thoughts on how you're preparing Zoom for the next chapter? What are the product milestones we should be expecting from the company? And the go-to-market transformation, the strategic initiatives, your partnerships, et cetera, to help Zoom be ready for that vision that you laid out in September.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Kash, that's a good question. Given that you are using Zoom Chat, right? It's always our unified communications platform. Not only that. But when it comes to unified communications platform, Chat or Phone and Video Conferencing, Events, Webinar, and all those missing part of contact center we just added on, right, to the UC platform. And also look at other 2 pillars and also the hybrid work and the business workflow as well. Essentially, in the next several years, we are working very hard to transform our business from a meeting company to a platform company, right? In terms of metrics, you got to look at our enterprise growth. Now online base used to be the revenue-wise very small, it's more like the byproduct of our online marketing platform because of COVID, right? That revenue grows very well, also very profitable. Now given the COVID is over, we have to go back to triple down on our enterprises growth in terms of more new services, in terms of embracing the platform, right? You will see in the next several years, we are going to introduce more and more enterprise services. And also from a technology perspective, like AI and also some more integration with other business workflow applications, I think, overall, add more and more value to our enterprise customers. I think that's way for us to look at our growth for the next few years.\nOperator: Matt Stotler with William Blair.\nMatthew Stotler: Hey, Eric, Kelly, Tom. Maybe just one, as you think about building out the full UC stack. Obviously, you've got many of the key components, video, phone, everything around those 2 contact center now that you're pushing into. When you look at especially some of your enterprise competitors, some of the large buy-in that you get from IT around those other solutions is because they're based on things like foundational productivity tools like e-mail or file sharing or scheduling and full feature chat, things like that. So how do you think about how those fit into your road map? Or if not directly, how you satisfy those needs for your enterprise customers as you keep moving that market?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Matt, first of all, for now, we're focused on unified communications platform, right? And not like a file sharing. That's the reason why Kash is using Zoom Chat, which is our persistent group chat. It's a part of our unified communications platform, right? Customer can standardize on Zoom, send or chat a message, send a chat message to a group. I continue. I have a phone call and contact center. That's our unified communications platform, right. That's part of the first pillar of our platform strategy. In terms of file sharing or an alternative, first of all, we are integrating very well with other vendors, right? How to further embed like those solutions into the Zoom platform play? This is also our strategy down the road. More to come and stay tuned.\nOperator: Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSitikantha Panigrahi: Hey, Eric and Kelly. I just wanted to ask you about the growth drivers. You referred earlier, you talked about so many products besides Video, you talked about Phones, Chat, Contact Center, so many other products. So how do you rank sort of this growth driver near term versus maybe medium term, like 2, 3 years out?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Near term, as I mentioned earlier, right, look at our platform, 3 key pillars, unified communications platform, hybrid work and business workflow platform. In terms of a near-term driver, we got to focus on double down, triple down our unified communications platform for the time being. And the future driver is not only that, but also how to support hybrid work, how to support the business workflow platform. Those 2 things will help us to further grow our business down the road in addition to unified communications platform.\nSitikantha Panigrahi: I mean what about contact center? When should we expect that to have some kind of material contribution?\nEric Yuan: Contact center is part of our unified communications platform, right? And again, customer already deployed meeting in the phone, they would like to deploy the contact center. Overall, we put the contact center into our nascent piece of the unified communications platform. Together, right, will drive our UC growth. But new growths will come from second pillar and third pillar.\nOperator: Taz Koujalgi with Guggenheim has the next question.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: I have a question for Eric and then a follow-up for Kelly. Eric, as you launch your own contact center, what does that mean for your partnership with Five9?\nEric Yuan: The partnership is still doing well because some customers already deploy Five9 now people to Zoom. We want to make sure, and we keep improving that experience, right? However, some customers -- some brand new customers who deployed on-prem solution and would like to consolidate everything to Zoom platform, yes, we would like to get those customers, right? And again, this market is huge for contact center. You look at all those modules, right? Or one of the contact centers, it is huge, right? And sometimes customers already deploy Five9, they are going to deploy more the features from Zoom, also deployed the Zoom contact center or deploy Genesys, if that's what suited okay. Again, we will focus on our installed base. We focus on those customers who truly believe Zoom's UC vision, would like to standardize on Zoom platform, right? That's our go-to strategy.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: And then one for Kelly. Kelly, if I look at your free cash flow margins for this year, there's about a 4-point gap between the operating margin and free cash flow margin. Going forward, as we have a bigger mix of enterprise, I guess, versus the online cohort, does that gap get wider, do you see a bigger delta between operating margins and free cash flow margins in fiscal '23?\nKelly Steckelberg: The gap in operating margins year-over-year is really being driven by our ongoing investment in R&D. So at a little over 6% this year, it's still not within our target range. Our targeted range for R&D is 10% to 12%. So that's a big driver for -- as we're continuing to invest and innovate for the future. And a little bit of that will be offset in the overall improvement in the gross margins for the long term, but we still are in the middle of that multiyear strategy of moving from the public cloud into our own co-located data centers, so that's going to take a little bit more time. And then sales and marketing is also going to increase a little bit as a percentage of revenue as we continue to focus on sales capacity as we talked about. And also really, as we're building upon this amazing brand awareness that we garnered for new meetings, we want to make sure that everybody also understands the great value they can get from being phone from an events as well as in contact centers. So you should expect to see more targeted product marketing in the future.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: But in terms of -- I don't guide to free cash flow margins, but that delta between operating margin and free cash flow margin should not remain consistent going forward? Or should that delta widen because now you have more enterprise customers who are probably paying upfront more and you get a better cash flow margin?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Over time, we expect our relationship between operating margin and free cash flow to go back to what it was pre-pandemic. So if you go back and look at the variability or the -- I should say, the differential you saw there, that's what you should expect to see as we move through -- probably sort of get through the back half of FY '23, it should start to normalize like that again. We still have some investments in the early part of this year around continue to build out our data centers. We're doing some office build-out as well. So you should expect to see CapEx a little bit higher than kind of the normalized rate. But eventually, we'll get back to that normal relationship.\nOperator: And we have time for 1 additional question, which will come from Parker Lane with Stifel.\nParker Lane: With the return of business travel and mandates being rolled back, curious to hear what your customers are thinking about in terms of their event plans for this year. Are you still anticipating that your customers will do more virtual-only and hybrid events than they did pre-COVID? And how is that sort of translating into the demand you're seeing for events in 2022?\nKelly Steckelberg: We really expect that as people start to travel, they're going to travel for certain events, but not for all of them. So we really expect the future to be hybrid, and that's why we're really excited about our Zoom Events strategy and that it can accommodate both in-person as well as virtual attendees. And that's what we really think is going to be the future because people, I mean, are excited to be out and being traveling again, but they want to do it when it's convenient for them and when it makes sense in their life. And I don't think we expect people to return back to the way it was pre-pandemic and it's going to be some combination just as work is, we expect events to be the same.\nEric Yuan: Parker, just to quickly add on to Kelly -- to what Kelly said. If you look at the events, for sure, that will be hybrid. Like last summer, I joined the Salesforce Dreamforce Hybrid Event. I had a great experience, right? A lot of people joined online and also they had several hundred people there in person, right? But in the future, even if that\u2019s still a hybrid event, I would say the percentage of -- and those people who are going to show up in person will be more and more. But again, it's still the hybrid. Also a lot of people are joining online as well. I do not think we'd be back to pre-pandemic. All the events, just everyone be there in person, I do not think that\u2019s the case based on the conversation with some of our customers.\nOperator: And again, that does conclude our Q&A. So Eric, I'll turn it back to you for any closing comments you may have.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Thank you. I really appreciate your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your support. I truly appreciate it. Thank you. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you so much, Eric. And again, everyone, that concludes today's earnings release. We thank you all for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day. See you next time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. Let me start with a few of the financial highlights for FY '22 and the results for Q4, then provide our outlook for Q1 and FY '23. We delivered another year of strong results. Revenue grew 55% to $4.1 billion as we exited FY '22 at an annualized run rate of $4.29 billion. We grew non-GAAP operating margin to 40.4%, up from 37.1% in FY '21 as we scale our operations. And we achieved an adjusted free cash flow margin of 38%. In Q4, total revenue grew 21% year-over-year to $1.07 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $1.053 billion. The growth was primarily driven by strength in our enterprise business, which continued to grow significantly faster than our online business. We also saw strong demand for Zoom Phone, which had a record quarter, adding over 550,000 paid seats. Much of the Zoom Phone growth came from strength in large customers with a number of customers with more 149% year-over-year, and the number of customers with more than 10,000 paid seats growing 122% year-over-year. We also added a major global bank as a Zoom Phone customer. We saw 66% year-over-year growth in the upmarket as we ended the year with 2,725 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represented 23% of revenue, up from 18% in Q4 of last year. We exited the quarter with approximately 509,800 customers with more than 10 employees, up 9% year-over-year. In Q4, customers with more than 10 employees represented 67% of revenue, up from 63% in Q4 of last year.  As we approach our three-year anniversary as a public company, a lot of incredible things have occurred at Zoom. We've seen unprecedented growth and brand awareness for Zoom Meetings and incredibly strong momentum for newer products. We have also expansively built out our direct, channel, and ISV go-to-market motions, which we collectively call Enterprise. These customers have high lifetime values as they tend to increase deployments, extend terms, and churn at much lower rates over time. Starting today, we will provide metrics that more closely align with the way our internal view of the business has evolved following this period of unprecedented growth and expansion. This will include the number of Enterprise customers and the Net Dollar Expansion rate for Enterprise customers. In the appendix of the investor deck you will find two-years of historical data for these new metrics. Additionally, through the end of FY \u201823, we will continue to provide the number of customers with more than 10 employees in the appendix. In Q4, the number of enterprise customers grew 35% year-over-year to approximately 191,000. Revenue from enterprise customers grew 38% year-over-year and represented 50% of total revenue, up from 44% in Q4 FY '21. We expect revenue from enterprise customers become increasingly higher percentage of total revenue over time. Our Online business, which we define as customers self-serviced through our online channel, represents the other half of our revenue, up from approximately 25% in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, before the pandemic. The self-service model is very attractive from profitability and cash flow perspectives. And while we have seen online grow more slowly than enterprise in recent quarters and expect that to continue going forward, we are continuing to invest in and innovate around this channel to drive growth. We will also be presenting our Net Dollar Expansion rate for Enterprise customers rather than our Net Dollar Expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees. First, let me start with the historic metric; our Q4 Net Dollar Expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees was in line with what we discussed in Q3, being just under 130% at 129%. Going forward, we will report the trailing twelve month Net Dollar Expansion rate for Enterprise customers, which in Q4 was 130%. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Our Americas revenue grew 21% year over year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew 23% year over year to be approximately 33% of revenue, stable with Q4 of last year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, Asia Pacific revenue grew slightly faster than the overall company, but we saw headwinds to our online business in EMEA, partially associated with the holiday seasonality. Let me share a few international highlights with you. We closed our largest overall deal ever in EMEA with 200,000 meetings licenses, and our largest Zoom Rooms deal in APAC with a customer deploying more than 3,300 Zoom Rooms to drive hybrid work across their offices. We have also expanded our partnership with Deutsche Telekom by committing to developing a joint solution specifically for the German market. We continue to view international expansion as a major opportunity for future growth. Now turning to profitability, which was strong from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, income tax benefits from discrete activities, and undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 78.3%, an improvement from 71.3% in Q4 of last year and 76.0% in Q3 of this year. The sequential improvement was mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers as well as the seasonally lower usage during the holidays. We expect this figure to return to the mid-seventies in the short-term, before improving in the mid to long-term, as we continue to build out our data centers. Research and development expense grew by 133% year over year to approximately $72 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense nearly doubled year over year to 6.7%, demonstrating our commitment to innovation and product development. We plan to further invest to enhance our platform, including our recently announced contact center product. Sales and marketing expense grew by 58% year-over-year to $251 million or approximately 23.4% of total revenue, primarily driven by increased marketing programs and sales headcount to drive future growth. We remain committed to investing in worldwide sales capacity and platform. G&A expense grew by 22% to $95 million or approximately 8.9% of total revenue. Non-GAAP operating income expanded to $420 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $363 million. This translates to a 39.2% non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 compared with a 40.9% a year ago and 39.1% last quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 grew to $1.29 on approximately 306 million non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding. This result is $0.22 above the high end of our guidance and $0.07 above Q4 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. The deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.2 billion, up 34% year-over-year from $883 million. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $2.6 billion, up 51% year-over-year from $1.7 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 63% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 70% in Q4 of last year, reflecting a shift back towards longer-term plan. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of renewals being front-end loaded and tapering through the year, our collections followed the same trend. Since our renewal linearity is unique, let me provide you once again with some color on next quarter's deferred revenue. We believe it will peak in Q1 at 12% to 13% year-over-year growth and moderate over the rest of the year, reflecting the smaller renewal rates.  We ended the quarter with approximately $5.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $209 million as compared to $399 million in Q4 of last year. Adjusted free cash flow, which excludes a onetime $85 million cash outflow related to a legal settlement that we disclosed and recognized as a GAAP expense in Q1 was $274 million as compared to $378 million in Q4 of last year. Now turning to our FY '23 guidance. This outlook is consistent with what we are observing in the market today. Specifically, it assumes that our enterprise business will grow substantially faster than our online business. It also assumes that our year-over-year total revenue growth rate will modestly accelerate in late FY '23. For the first quarter of FY '23, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.07 billion to $1.075 billion. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $345 million to $350 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.86 to $0.88 based on approximately 309 million shares outstanding. As mentioned last quarter, due to our multiyear history of profitability, we have fully utilized our NOLs. We expect our tax rate to approximate the U.S. blended tax rate in FY '23. For the full year of FY '23, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.53 billion to $4.55 billion, which would represent approximately 11% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $1.43 billion to $1.45 billion, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 32%. While our revenue grew 558% from FY '20 to FY '22, our operating margin also increased from 14% to 40%. We are pursuing a massive opportunity, and we will continue to focus on the appropriate balance between growth and margins as we build out and deliver on the potential of our platform. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $3.45 to $3.51 based on approximately 312 million shares outstanding. As indicated in our earnings press release today, our Board has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program that we intend to execute on beginning this quarter. This not only underscores the confidence that our Board and our management team have in the future of Zoom, but also allows us to leverage our strong profitability, cash flow generation and strength of our balance sheet to deliver returns back to our shareholders. We are excited about the large and growing opportunity ahead of us as we continue to execute on our strategy and growth outlook. As always, Zoom is grateful to be a driving force, enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless and secure communications platform. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community and our investors. Kelcey, please queue up our first question. Yes. Thank you, Meta. So we continue to see strength in our renewals, especially in the enterprise business. And as you heard from some of the highlights we talked about earlier, we had a very strong performance from Zoom Phone in Q4 as well and also Zoom Rooms as customers are really thinking about the future of hybrid work and how they're going to keep everyone collect connected as they bring them back to the office. This is a really important strategy for them. And you heard Eric talk about some of that, and maybe Eric sets on the strategy around that, but continue to see strength both in renewals in the enterprise as well as additional Phone seats and Zoom Rooms. Yes. I mean one of the key things we always look at internally is sales productivity, looking at it both from a U.S. and an international perspective. And then on the marketing side, we look at internally. We also look at things like opportunities and leads that get generated from any of those. And then, of course, maybe the external benchmark, we're always looking at is sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue. Yes. So specifically, in enterprise, we expect that part of our business to grow at approximately 20% year-over-year. And then that you can back into that what we're expecting from our online business is for it to be flattish for the year, but it might have some variability quarter-over-quarter. So in terms of the second half acceleration, you're looking at in the upmarket or the enterprise, I should say now. It will be driven largely by continued expansion and growth in our existing customers as well as contribution from some of our new products that we're really excited about, including contact center. And then in the online business, what you're going to see is maybe we talked about at Analyst Day last year, how once those cohorts get to a certain age of [16] months and older, there's a lot of stability that comes with those retention rates. By the time we get to the second half of this year, all of those cohorts that we acquired during the pandemic are going to have hit that cycle. So it's really going to start to bring stability to the online business in a way that we haven't seen historically. And then in terms of the net dollar expansion rate to the online, we won't be disclosing that. So in other words, I think the best I can give you is based on what Sterling just asked, which is, what's the growth rate for that business? And as I mentioned, we expect it to be flattish for next year with some variability quarter-over-quarter. Sure. So Brad, if you -- or Mike, sorry, if you remember back in Analyst Day last fall, we shared a chart that shows how as cohorts age, when they get to that 16 months and older, they really stabilize in terms of retention rates. And if you go back and look at that, you're able to see what we shared with not only the retention rates, but also where we are in that aging process. And so it's very easy for us now to look forward and predict how those retention rates are going to impact the overall base of that -- of the online business. And so that's exactly what we've assumed. They just continue aging because we've seen really strong stability in those retention rates as they get to that 15 to 16 months age. So it hasn't changed even as the business has kind of overall volatile, it doesn't change in those order of things. So we're just following that along. Yes. So we -- it's still early right now. We have -- we haven't done it in terms of attach rate yet. We just look forward to the back half of this year and assume that we start to see some revenue there. We saw really -- we had many really strong enterprise customers sign up for the beta. So we're excited to see how it goes. So the international team has grown tremendously over the last few years. We certainly continue to see opportunity. And we talked about this before, but as a quick reminder, with the growth and the brand awareness over the last few years, it's really enabled us to go in and put reps where we see opportunities without having to see markets with marketing dollars. I think the big area of opportunity that still is for us internationally is the channel. That is where we -- there's a cross-functional initiative in the company to really focus on the channel, especially focused around on Phone, and that can be master agents that can be carriers, Deutsche Telekom and our strong partnership there, we just announced, is a great example of that effort. And we're going to continue to focus especially over this next coming year because that's a really important part of the distribution strategy for Zoom Phone. Sure. So in terms of inorganic and the open for M&A, we really are continuing to be focused on this. And I think, the strength of our balance sheet in terms of cash leaves us a lot of opportunity regardless of what's happening with our stock price, honestly. So we will continue to focus on opportunities for augmenting talent or technology, which is what we've said all along. And then in terms of the decline in the -- you are right, it was slightly down, the customers with greater than 10 employees. And you -- back up for just a quick minute, remember that when we went public, we picked that metric as a proxy for our direct business and that customers with fewer than 10 was the proxy for our online segment. And what's happened over time as we've seen this tremendous growth in online as a channel, it started to kind of overlap there, which is why we don't think it's really the appropriate metric to use any longer going forward. But that decline was driven by churn that we saw in the Online segment of our business with customers that have more than 10 employees. So Peter, I would say that Zoom has always been disruptive in pricing and contact center is absolutely different. If you look across the market in how we price Meetings, how we price in Phone, we introduced it. We're approximately half the price of any of our competitors' list price. And that continues to be the case with contact center as well. I mean, over time, we absolutely will continue to add features and functionality with exact same approach that we took for Zoom Phone in terms of the launch and how it grew over time and expanded the features and functionality. The same is true with Contact Center. But you should not take the price as reflecting anything in terms of the quality of that product. So as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, Shebly, we absolutely expect there to be an inflection point and for revenue to start to reaccelerate in the back half of the year. We're not yet -- we're not prepared to give multiyear guidance at this point. But what you should expect is we're modeling for the exit growth rate to be higher than the full year growth rate for FY '23. Yes. So in Q4, we did see -- we saw strength in Asia Pac, and we even saw strength in EMEA, too. As you remember, we announced our largest deal ever for EMEA, which is super exciting. So strength in the enterprise segment of the business. But we absolutely saw an impact from holiday seasonality, which we expected. We talked about that in the call on Q3 as you remember.  In terms of looking forward, international absolutely is a really important part of our growth strategy, and we do continue to expect it to grow at a rate that is higher than the U.S. And so that's -- and we will continue to also add -- invest in sales capacity internationally at a rate that is higher on a percentage basis than we would be doing in the U.S. as well. Yes. I mean it's -- so in terms of like this is why this number doesn't make sense anymore because it's gotten so mixed up between the customers and the channel. I think the size of the customers and the channel, that's what gotten really unconvoluted with this metric going forward and why we're not going to really talk about it going forward. So in terms of how we see it going forward, honestly, Rishi, we aren't even modeling around this metric any longer. We are completely moving to thinking about enterprise and online because as I said in the prepared remarks, that really reflects how we think about the business and how we are measuring and managing that's what makes the most sense. And what you should really continue to see is ongoing growth in the enterprise business. We're super excited about the strength that we see there and double-digit growth for next year. And that online is going to be flattish, and that's what we expect. In terms of what these customers are doing, we -- especially in the smaller customers, we see them -- we even come back, we even come back, right? We make it very flexible for them to do that. And so at any point in time, they might be taking a break, but they might come back when it makes sense for them. And that's what we want. We want it to be easy for them to come and go as they see the need for our products. Yes. In terms of the outlook on pricing perspective, we currently don't have plans to increase our prices across the board. We are especially for the online segment of our business, we are looking at opportunities for localized pricing and selling in local currency, which I think will be really helpful in terms of especially some of the smaller customers in those markets, and getting those plans rightsized to those markets. But no plans to increase our prices across the board. And then in terms of the beats that you were mentioning for as we've grown and scaled as a business, I think you're starting to see our guidance and our beat get more correlated to the size of the business and reflects the growth rates that we're experiencing going forward. Yes. So remember that, unfortunately, billings is not a good forward-looking metric. And it's due to the fact that we have this split in our business. And the enterprise business is -- the billings associated with that are what you would expect in a normal SaaS business, and they're multiyear -- annual to multiyear. In the online business, it is not. But there are many of those customers that are still buying and pay on a monthly basis. So it really doesn't make sense for a metric, and that's why you're going to continue to see volatility in that metric. And because of that, I think what we've tried to give you was at least some color around deferred revenue. So you can understand that because also the seasonality and the linearity that we have in our renewals and our billings. Unfortunately, the best that I have to give you is our revenue guidance, and that's it. We're trying to give you metrics that better reflect now how we think about that. The gap in operating margins year-over-year is really being driven by our ongoing investment in R&D. So at a little over 6% this year, it's still not within our target range. Our targeted range for R&D is 10% to 12%. So that's a big driver for -- as we're continuing to invest and innovate for the future. And a little bit of that will be offset in the overall improvement in the gross margins for the long term, but we still are in the middle of that multiyear strategy of moving from the public cloud into our own co-located data centers, so that's going to take a little bit more time. And then sales and marketing is also going to increase a little bit as a percentage of revenue as we continue to focus on sales capacity as we talked about. And also really, as we're building upon this amazing brand awareness that we garnered for new meetings, we want to make sure that everybody also understands the great value they can get from being phone from an events as well as in contact centers. So you should expect to see more targeted product marketing in the future. Yes. Over time, we expect our relationship between operating margin and free cash flow to go back to what it was pre-pandemic. So if you go back and look at the variability or the -- I should say, the differential you saw there, that's what you should expect to see as we move through -- probably sort of get through the back half of FY '23, it should start to normalize like that again. We still have some investments in the early part of this year around continue to build out our data centers. We're doing some office build-out as well. So you should expect to see CapEx a little bit higher than kind of the normalized rate. But eventually, we'll get back to that normal relationship. We really expect that as people start to travel, they're going to travel for certain events, but not for all of them. So we really expect the future to be hybrid, and that's why we're really excited about our Zoom Events strategy and that it can accommodate both in-person as well as virtual attendees. And that's what we really think is going to be the future because people, I mean, are excited to be out and being traveling again, but they want to do it when it's convenient for them and when it makes sense in their life. And I don't think we expect people to return back to the way it was pre-pandemic and it's going to be some combination just as work is, we expect events to be the same."

            "name": "Eric Yuan",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom. Before I begin, I want to welcome Bill McDermott, CEO of ServiceNow, who will join our Board of Directors tomorrow. I look forward to working with Bill, a visionary in the technology space and a successful software executive. I'd also like to thank Bart Swanson, who is stepping down from our Board of Directors tomorrow, for his years of service on our Board, and wish him the best in his future endeavors. Let me also thank our global Zoom team, customers, partners, and investors for their support as we celebrate the 10-year anniversary of our inception and three-year anniversary of our IPO. Now, I'd like to share with you three key pillars of the Zoom strategy, which we are building out to drive future growth: The first pillar is really about being a full unified communications platform. We made enormous strides over the past several years evolving from a meetings company into a multi-product platform, including video conferencing, events, chat, phone, and more. The missing piece was the contact center, that was until our announcement last week. More on that in a moment. The second pillar is hybrid work. Because we believe hybrid work is going to become more flexible and less about location. No matter where you are - office, traveling, or home - Zoom wants to make sure you have a consistent experience. Whether with Zoom Rooms or on a Zoom-connected device, we want to make sure you're part of the conversation and able to collaborate, anywhere and everywhere. The third pillar is business workflows and how we leverage our API marketplace, our Zoom Apps, and our SDK. Many technology companies tell me that they want to integrate Zoom into their platform to improve the communication and collaboration experience for their customers. For instance, we recently announced a Zoom-DocuSign integration. This will allow customers to review a document during a Zoom Meeting and approve it as part of a simple bi-directional business workflow. We are in the early innings of this transformation of work and communication. We believe there is a massive opportunity, and we plan to address it with the same level of innovation, scalability, and simplicity that has made Zoom the trusted platform for hundreds of thousands of businesses around the world. As a key part of our UC stack, I am super excited about the announcement we made last week. We announced the general availability of Zoom Contact Center, an omnichannel customer engagement solution that is optimized for video and integrated right into the Zoom client. It brings unified communications together with modern contact center capabilities, helps customers connect over video, and also supports channels like voice, SMS, and webchat. Zoom Contact Center is simple for admins to configure and deploy. They can easily create menus, greetings, and prompts right in the Zoom Admin portal. The product can also integrate chat and video into an existing digital presence, like a website, helping organizations have conversations with customers in the right place and at the right time. This is just the beginning of our plan to modernize the contact center and enrich the experience for our customer and our customer's customer. Speaking of customers, we ended the year with a lot of great wins. First, I want to thank Medtronic, a global leader in healthcare technology, for expanding their partnership with Zoom. In 2020, Medtronic chose Zoom Meetings, Zoom Rooms, and Zoom Webinars to enable its global employees to communicate and collaborate better. In Q4 of FY22, after a careful vendor selection process, they decided to add 60,000 Zoom Phone licenses to a new multi-year agreement. Thank you Medtronic for trusting Zoom to deliver a modern, integrated UCaaS solution to support your global communications needs. Thank you Intuit, the global technology platform that makes TurboTax, QuickBooks, Mint, Credit Karma and Mailchimp, for entrusting Zoom with their video communications over the past few years and recently adding Zoom Phone to create a unified communications platform across their organization. Thank you Arizona State University, which was recently recognized by U.S. News & World Report as the country's most innovative school, and has been a strong supporter of Zoom products over the years. As a leading research university, a highly effective communications platform is important to drive collaboration between their students, staff and community. ASU chose Zoom to be a complete communications platform with 50,000 Zoom Meetings, 700 Zoom Rooms, and 15,000 Zoom Phone licenses as well as Zoom Webinars. I also want to recognize LIXIL Group Corporation, a Japanese manufacturer and pioneer of building materials and housing equipment. As a Zoom Meetings and Zoom Rooms customer, LIXIL has embraced hybrid work for communication and collaboration while leveraging the ease of use of the Zoom platform to enhance their customer experience with video tours of their showrooms. In Q4, LIXIL added 10,000 Zoom Phone licenses, committing to a unified communication platform. Thank you Medtronic, Intuit, Arizona State, and LIXIL. I am so grateful to have such a great group of customers. The world wants a full communications platform; one that is integrated with other workflows, supports hybrid work, and is secure and easy to use. Zoom is hard at work ensuring our customers exceed the soaring expectations of how businesses collaborate internally and communicate externally. To sustain and enhance our leadership position in this new era of digital transformation, we plan in FY \u201823 to build out our platform to further enrich the customer experience and expand our go-to-market motions, which will enable us to drive future growth for Zoom.  I want to thank our Zoomies for their hard work over the past 10 years. We have grown to nearly 6,800 strong and are more focused than ever on delivering happiness every day to our hundreds of thousands of customers around the world. And with that, then let me pass it over to Kevin. Thank you. Hey, Michael, that is a great question. We are super excited about our contact center announcement of last week. And first of all, this is based on our customers' feedback. Several years ago, after the launch of Zoom Phone, many of our customers told us they would like to standardize on Zoom platform for unified communications. The only missing piece is contact center. We listen to our customers, our team is working so hard and finally, we've announced the Zoom Contact Center.  But in terms of growth, similar to what we did to grow our Zoom Phone business, right? For the first year, for sure, right, we are going to target those customers who really want to standardize on Zoom platform, probably started from Meeting, for those customers who deploy both Meeting and Phone, now they look at the contact center. Also at the same time, we are working very hard at more and more features. I think probably for those customers as long as they want to embrace the cloud business content center, as long as they want to standardize on Zoom unified communication platform, who would like to targeted to, right? And that's our strategy. And that's omnichannel, Video and it's very strong. We also support SMS, voice and web chat. Again, a lot of hard work, and we are going to continue innovating. And to drive our Zoom Contact Center growth. And based on the early data feedback, our customers are also very excited. They wanted to deploy a solution and really understand the unified collaboration. Also at the same time, we build this solution from ground up, right? And very consistent competitor Video and Phone, we're very excited about this opportunity. Yes, Sterling, by the way, our enterprise growth is pretty strong as we add more and more new services like contact center is first one, right? We are not going to stop here. This is our company being who truly understand the enterprise customer need. We are going to add more and more enterprise services to further grow our enterprise business. Yes, Kelly, feel free to chime in. So James, you were right on, given the great resignation, right, it's pretty challenging, right, across the industry, right? And again, we always double down our company culture, and this is extremely important for us, right? How to make sure we deliver happiness to our customers. My number 1 priority is really think about our employees how to make sure our employees are happy, right? We are doing so many things to really help our employees. And also, again, over the past 2 years, we more than probably tripled the size of the company, right? Many employees is drawn to Zoom remotely. Again, that's not easy, but good news soon is going to change. Especially if you look at our remote employees, how to make sure offer the flexibility and also make sure support our employees' needs by always set the feedback from our employees. We also have a happiness crew, always trying to understand what's the pain point of whatever we can do differently to think of an employee. By doing that, I'm pretty sure, and we are going to make sure I'm pretty happy, and we'll be okay. And that's always our formula. Yes. So that's -- yes, it's a great question. Actually, Q4 was a record quarter, right, in terms of number of new seats, more than 0.5 million, if I recall correctly, around 550,000 newly added seats for Zoom Phone. I think the first one, not only for our existing customers, but also for new customers as well because of trust we build established with our customers over the past several years, and customers think about how to transform their business to fully embrace digital transformation, how to migrate their on-prem phone system to the cloud. They always want to deploy the best solution. Plus most of the customers already deployed the Video content solution and also they want to have 1 consistent experience. That front-end experience is very consistent, the back-end also is very consistent. And plus very reliable and ease of use, security and also a lot of cool features. And that's the reason why customers they want to deploy the Zoom Phone. As long as a customer, they win us through the win their selection process, we have high confidence.  Look at Intuit, look at the Medtronic. It's not 1,000 of licenses, that's a 10,000 licenses, right? And again, that business still -- we'll continue doing very well. And also, we are not going to stop here. We'll add more and more features, more innovations, plus combined with the contact center. We do see the accelerated growth for both the Phone and also our Contact Center down the road. Hey, Ryan, that's a really great question. Looking at our growth strategy, right? 3 things, 3 pillars, right? An unified communication platform, we just added contact center, we're going to add more and more. The second pillar really about the hybrid work. The third one is extremely important, which is business workflow platform, right? And we have SDK, some healthcare customers and they would like to embed SDK into their telemedicine, telehealth offering, we have API also marketplace. But the most important thing is really about the Zoom Apps, right? We just announced a Zoom-DocuSign integration. Essentially, during the meeting time, it's very easy. In 1 click, I look at a document, I can approve that. More and more integration like that. Giving a meeting time or all site meeting time as well, right? And that's the key for our -- the platform growth. And another reason why we invited a great leader and CEO of ServiceNow, right, join our Board, right? ServiceNow is probably the best workflow application provider, right? How to learn from ServiceNow? How to embed more and more other business workflow applications to the Zoom platform and also vice versa. I think that can truly help our customers, right? Rather than they leave the Zoom interface, go to other business context, right, they can stay within the Zoom interface, can get the job done, right? Also, we are doubling down our SDK platform, right? Like education, healthcare, a lot of vertical industries, start up, they would like to embed zoom to their offering. That's why we are very excited about our business workflow platform. Yes. Matt, to add on to what Kelly said, I think it's time to really look at the online business and also our direct business, driven by sales channel. An online business, meaning those customers never interacted with our sales rep, right, just to go online to use their credit card to buy. I think that's probably the best -- it's the right time for us. Look at the online business and also direct channel business, right, rather than just 10 employee -- because it's still a little bit confusing, right? Sometimes you also talk to our sales rep, sometimes go on and to buy. And it's time for us to look at the pure online business, meaning they never interact with our sales rep, right? I think that's a better rate, the better metrics down the road. Yes, Peter, Kelly is right on. Our growth strategy always better product, better price and also much better service. Yes. Just quickly, prior to pandemic, our growth strategy is very clear, right? Double down on enterprise; every 2 years, we're going to introduce a new service, right? To really add mobile, right? Also upsell. Over the past 2 years, we have to really think about how to help the world and help people stay connected. That's the reason why we spend a lot of time to make sure I offer the K-12 school free services also and focus on online business as well. Right now, we're seeing end of COVID crisis, right, we got to go back, double down our enterprise growth strategy. Also, at the same time, we have to adjust our previous enterprise growth strategy, which is every 2 years, you are to add a new service. Now probably every 1 year, you need to add 1 more new services, right? That's a way for us. That's the reason why we adjust our growth strategy, right, to double down, triple down our enterprise customers. Yes. So again, Alex, that's comms competition, right? We always focus on -- really focus on our customers, right? And so it's easy to piggyback and double down on innovation. That's pretty much -- that is the formula, it's very sustainable. But however, if we would really just focus on some of our competitors, I would say, first of all -- and you take Microsoft for example, right? And in some enterprise customers they have standardized on Microsoft. Some enterprise customers are standardized on Zoom platform. For some enterprise customers, you look at [Okta] billions in report, right? And look at the [Okta's] Microsoft Office 365 deployment. In terms of coexistence, between Zoom -- and Zoom, that percentage is increasing year-over-year around [45%], right? Meaning all those [Okta] and Microsoft Office 365 customers need to deploy both Zoom and Microsoft solution, right? And also, we also on many fronts, we partner with Microsoft as well, right? I think that's why the market is huge, right? And some customers realize the Zoom platform, great. They like Microsoft Chat, yes. They deployed a Zoom Video and Voice. But I think that will continue. Also, at the same time, right? Like we added a contact center, we are going to add more and more new services, right? In addition to focus on horizontal collaboration platform, we also want to focus on more value-added like contact center and also some other services as well, right? And by doing that, on the right hand, we compete against some of those bigger competitors; on the other hand, it also integrate more and more with them as well, right? That's our strategy. Yes. Yes. Kash, that's a good question. Given that you are using Zoom Chat, right? It's always our unified communications platform. Not only that. But when it comes to unified communications platform, Chat or Phone and Video Conferencing, Events, Webinar, and all those missing part of contact center we just added on, right, to the UC platform. And also look at other 2 pillars and also the hybrid work and the business workflow as well. Essentially, in the next several years, we are working very hard to transform our business from a meeting company to a platform company, right? In terms of metrics, you got to look at our enterprise growth. Now online base used to be the revenue-wise very small, it's more like the byproduct of our online marketing platform because of COVID, right? That revenue grows very well, also very profitable. Now given the COVID is over, we have to go back to triple down on our enterprises growth in terms of more new services, in terms of embracing the platform, right? You will see in the next several years, we are going to introduce more and more enterprise services. And also from a technology perspective, like AI and also some more integration with other business workflow applications, I think, overall, add more and more value to our enterprise customers. I think that's way for us to look at our growth for the next few years. Yes. Matt, first of all, for now, we're focused on unified communications platform, right? And not like a file sharing. That's the reason why Kash is using Zoom Chat, which is our persistent group chat. It's a part of our unified communications platform, right? Customer can standardize on Zoom, send or chat a message, send a chat message to a group. I continue. I have a phone call and contact center. That's our unified communications platform, right. That's part of the first pillar of our platform strategy. In terms of file sharing or an alternative, first of all, we are integrating very well with other vendors, right? How to further embed like those solutions into the Zoom platform play? This is also our strategy down the road. More to come and stay tuned. Yes. Near term, as I mentioned earlier, right, look at our platform, 3 key pillars, unified communications platform, hybrid work and business workflow platform. In terms of a near-term driver, we got to focus on double down, triple down our unified communications platform for the time being. And the future driver is not only that, but also how to support hybrid work, how to support the business workflow platform. Those 2 things will help us to further grow our business down the road in addition to unified communications platform. Contact center is part of our unified communications platform, right? And again, customer already deployed meeting in the phone, they would like to deploy the contact center. Overall, we put the contact center into our nascent piece of the unified communications platform. Together, right, will drive our UC growth. But new growths will come from second pillar and third pillar. The partnership is still doing well because some customers already deploy Five9 now people to Zoom. We want to make sure, and we keep improving that experience, right? However, some customers -- some brand new customers who deployed on-prem solution and would like to consolidate everything to Zoom platform, yes, we would like to get those customers, right? And again, this market is huge for contact center. You look at all those modules, right? Or one of the contact centers, it is huge, right? And sometimes customers already deploy Five9, they are going to deploy more the features from Zoom, also deployed the Zoom contact center or deploy Genesys, if that's what suited okay. Again, we will focus on our installed base. We focus on those customers who truly believe Zoom's UC vision, would like to standardize on Zoom platform, right? That's our go-to strategy. Parker, just to quickly add on to Kelly -- to what Kelly said. If you look at the events, for sure, that will be hybrid. Like last summer, I joined the Salesforce Dreamforce Hybrid Event. I had a great experience, right? A lot of people joined online and also they had several hundred people there in person, right? But in the future, even if that's still a hybrid event, I would say the percentage of -- and those people who are going to show up in person will be more and more. But again, it's still the hybrid. Also a lot of people are joining online as well. I do not think we'd be back to pre-pandemic. All the events, just everyone be there in person, I do not think that's the case based on the conversation with some of our customers. Yes. Thank you. I really appreciate your time. Thank you for your time. Thank you for your support. I truly appreciate it. Thank you. Take care."

I'd like to remind everyone this call is being recorded. 00:10 At this time, I'd like to turn it over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations.\nTom McCallum: 00:14 Thank you, Matt. And let me welcome everyone as well to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the third quarter of fiscal twenty twenty two. I\u2019m joined today by Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan and Zoom\u2019s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. 00:29 Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.com. Also on this page you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. 00:49 During this call we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year twenty twenty two; Zoom\u2019s expectations regarding financial and business trends; Zoom\u2019s growth strategy and business aspirations to help customers embrace change, enable hybrid workforces, and grow their businesses; product features and the expected benefits of such features; and Zoom continuing to fortify its position as a leading brand in its industry. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today\u2019s webinar. 01:44 And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: 01:48 Thank you Tom. In the spirit of the upcoming holiday season, I want to recognize the hard work of Zoom\u2019s global workforce and thank our customers, partners and investors for their steadfast trust and support. We continue to fortify our position as a leading brand in our industry. We are honored that Gartner named us a Leader in the twenty twenty one Magic Quadrant for Meeting Solutions for the sixth consecutive year and for Unified Communications as a Service for the second consecutive year. 02:28 Zoomtopia twenty twenty one was bigger and more successful than ever before. We hosted nearly thirty four thousand live virtual attendees on our platform and two seventy seven speakers, including customers like Choice Hotels, Ally, and Hubspot. And we did it on Zoom Events, our all-in-one solution for virtual and hybrid events. 02:56 Zoom Events allowed us to streamline event preparation, enhance audience engagement, and conduct better post-event communication and analysis. Its multitrack functionality enabled us to roll our Analyst Day directly into the Zoomtopia agenda so that participants could move seamlessly across the Analyst Day track, other tracks of Zoomtopia, and the all-connecting lobby. 03:29 At Zoomtopia, customers shared how they use Zoom to enable flexible co-located workforces and grow their businesses. We demonstrated how Zoom Apps, which already has sixty seven apps after only a few months, has the potential to enhance meeting productivity and collaboration. More and more businesses are building products on our platform that connect interrelated work streams to the Zoom client, both inside and outside the meeting. 04:03 We were also super excited to unveil the Zoom Video Engagement Center, which enhances our customers\u2019 ability to communicate with their customers through our omnichannel solution, and shows our broader commitment to the contact center space. It is expected to be generally available early next year. 04:28 Whether it\u2019s the ability to virtually whiteboard in and around the meeting, or utilize AI to transcribe or translate a meeting live, Zoomtopia demonstrated that previously futuristic capabilities have arrived. We are working hard to develop and deploy the technologies of the future to address current business needs and reimagine how we communicate and work in a flexible hybrid world. 04:59 Now let me recognize a few big wins for the quarter. We are excited to have Carrier Global Corp, the leading global provider of healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions, as a long standing Zoom Meetings customer and now, a new Zoom Phone customer as well. Following several months of extensive vendor reviews of leading UCaaS vendors, Carrier selected Zoom Phone to modernize their phone systems for a large portion of their nearly fifty three thousand employees across one eighty countries. We are so thankful that Carrier choses Zoom to deliver an increasingly comprehensive, secure, innovative and integrated set of communications services 05:56 In addition to Carrier, we had many other upsells this quarter. For example, one of the world\u2019s largest global retailers decided to add twenty thousand Zoom Phone licenses to their existing Meetings, Rooms, and Webinar footprint in order to better manage their global offices, distribution centers, and retail locations. This demonstrates our strong value add to the retail vertical and builds upon previous success stories like Tapestry and Target. 06:34 We also had several notable Zoom Meetings wins in Q3, including, a large expansion for a leading Federal System Integrator which puts them at forty five thousand users, demonstrating the security and reliability of our Zoom For Government Platform. A competitive win with a global technology firm for sixteen thousand five hundred meeting licenses to modernize the way their employees communicate, and expansion within our big four audit and big three consulting clients, which added more than thirty five thousand meetings licenses in the quarter to their existing strong meetings footprints. 07:25 Thanks to our customers, investors and the hard work of our approximately six thousand three hundred employees, we\u2019ve grown over the past decade from a video conferencing solution to a communications platform that encompasses unified communications, as well as developer and event solutions. All these services provide an indispensable platform for individuals, enterprises and developers to connect, collaborate and build in the hybrid world. 8:00 And with that let me pass it over to Kelly.\nKelly Steckelberg: 08:05 Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. Let me start by reviewing our financial results for Q3 and then discuss our outlook for Q4. 08:16 In Q3, total revenue grew thirty five percent year over year to one point zero five billion dollars, exceeding the high end of our guidance of one point zero two billion dollars. The growth was primarily driven by strength in our direct and channel businesses, which grew at twice the rate of our online business, as well as improved churn in both online and direct segments. 08:39 From a product perspective, we saw strong demand for Zoom Video Webinars, Zoom Rooms, and Zoom Phone. Zoom Phone had year-over-year revenue growth in the triple-digits and reached thirty customers with over twn thousand paid seats. The year-over-year growth in revenue for the quarter was driven by a healthy mix between new and existing customers, with existing customers accounting for twenty six percent of the incremental revenue, up from nineteen percent a year ago. 09:11 Let\u2019s take a look at the key customer metrics for the quarter. We saw ninety four percent year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with two thousand five hundred and seven customers generating more than one hundred thousand dollars in trailing twelve months revenue. These customers represented twenty two percent of revenue, up from eighteen percent in Q3 of last year. We exited the quarter with approximately five hundred and twelve thousand one hundred customers with more than ten employees, up eighteen percent year over year. 09:46 In Q3 customers with more than ten employees represented sixty six percent of revenue, up from six -- excuse me, sixty four percent last quarter, and sixty two percent in Q3 of last year. These trends suggest that our customers with more than ten employees are expanding their use of our platform and adding more products and seats, aligned with our go-to-market strategy. 10:12 Our net dollar expansion rate for customers with more than ten employees exceeded one hundred and thirty percent for the fourteenth consecutive quarter as existing customers increased their spend with Zoom and we saw strong upsells of Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms. For Q4, we expect this metric to be modestly below one hundred and thirty percent mark as the denominator of this trailing twelve month metric reflects a significant growth in our customer base. 10:41 Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Our Americas revenue grew thirty percent year over year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew forty seven percent year over year to be approximately thirty three percent of revenue, up from thirty one percent a year ago. On a quarter over quarter basis, Asia Pacific had another strong quarter driven by growth in Australia and Japan and bolstered by the investments we have made in our international team. However, as we discussed in Q2, we saw headwinds to our online business in EMEA, mainly related to summer seasonality. 11:23 Now, turning to profitability which was strong from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains on strategic investments, and undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities. 11:51 Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was seventy six percent, an improvement from sixty eight point two percent in Q3 of last year and stable with Q2 of this year. We remain committed to our multi-year strategy of building out our data centers to support further improvements in gross margin. 12:12 Research and development expense grew by one hundred and sixty nine percent year over year to approximately sixty eight million dollars. On a sequential basis, we added over thirteen million dollars in R&D expense, primarily due to expansion within our engineering and product teams globally. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense doubled year over year to six point four percent demonstrating our commitment to innovation and product development. 12:40 Sales and marketing expense grew by sixty eight percent year over year to two thirty seven million dollars or approximately twenty two point six percent of total revenue, primarily driven by increased marketing programs and sales headcount to drive future growth. We remain committed to investing in global sales capacity and marketing across our core and new products. 13:03 G&A expense grew by twelve percent to eighty two million dollars or approximately seven point eight percent of total revenue. This was lower than Q3 of last year as we expanded our G&A functions prudently to meet our new sales. 13:19 The revenue upside in the quarter carried through to the bottom line, with non-GAAP operating income of four hundred and eleven million dollars exceeding the high end of our guidance of three forty five million dollars. This translates to a thirty nine point one non-GAAP operating margin for Q3 compared with thirty seven point four percent a year ago and forty one point six percent last quarter. 13:44 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was one point one one dollars on approximately three hundred and six million non-GAAP weighted average shares of outstanding. This result is zero point zero three dollars above the high end of our guidance and zero point one two dollars above Q3 of last year. 14:02 This result includes a seventy million dollars provision for income tax, a significant increase from last year, mainly due to fully utilizing our NOLs as well as a decrease in our stock-based compensation for tax purposes. 14:19 Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was one point two billion dollars, up thirty nine percent year over year from eight fifty five million dollars, and slightly up quarter over quarter. Looking at Q4, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in deferred revenue to be in the mid twenty. This is driven by the cyclical decline in the average remaining term of our annual customer contracts, which are front-half weighted. 14:50 Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately two point five billion dollars, up fifty one percent year over year from one point six billion dollars. We expect to recognize approximately sixty seven percent of the total RPO as revenue over the next twelve months, as compared to seventy two percent in Q3 of last year, reflecting a shift back towards longer term plans. 15:17 We ended the quarter with approximately five point four billion dollars in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of three hundred and ninety five million dollars, as compared to four hundred and eleven million dollars in Q3 of last year. Free cash flow was three seventy five million dollars, as compared to three eighty eight million dollars in Q3 of last year. 15:42 It\u2019s important to note that as we progress beyond the initial phases of the pandemic growth and continue to invest to support our new scale, our working capital is normalizing. In Q4, we expect to incur a one-time eighty five million dollar cash outflow related to a legal settlement, which we disclosed and booked as a GAAP expense in Q1. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of renewals being front-end loaded and tapering through the year, our collections will follow the same trend. We also expand CapEx investments in building out our data centers to support future gross margin expansion. 16:26 Now, turning to guidance. We are pleased to raise our outlook for FY twenty twenty two. This outlook is based on our current assessment of the business environment. Specifically, it assumes that our direct and channel business will continue to grow, while our online business will be a headwind in the coming quarters as smaller customers and consumers adapt to the evolving environment. 16:49 For the fourth quarter of FY twenty twenty two, we expect revenue to be in the range of one point zero five one billion dollars to one point zero five three billion dollars. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of three sixty one million dollars to three hundred and sixty three million dollars. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is one point zero six dollar to one point zero seven dollar based on approximately three hundred and seven million shares outstanding and a tax rate of approximately ten percent. 17:20 Due to our multi-year history of profitability, we have fully utilized our NOLs. We expect our tax rate to approximate the U.S. blended tax rate in FY twenty twenty three. For the full year of FY twenty twenty two, we expect revenue to be in the range of four point zero seven nine to four point zero eight one billion dollars, which would represent approximately fifty four percent year-over-year growth, up from our previous guidance of fifty one percent issued in August. 17:51 We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately one point five nine eight dollars to one point six billion dollars which would represent approximately sixty three percent year-over-year growth. Our outlook for the non-GAAP earnings per share is. 18:03 Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is four point eight four dollars to four point eight five dollars based on approximately three hundred and six million shares outstanding. As always, Zoom is grateful to be a driving force enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless and secure communications platform. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors 18:34 Matt, please queue up our first question.\nOperator: 18:38 Our first question is from Sterling Auty with JP Morgan.\nSterling Auty: 18:43 Yeah, thanks. Hi guys. Eric, you mentioned you kind of evolving into a communications company. And I'm wondering if you think about the over four hundred million business phone users that are on legacy technology. How do anticipate capitalizing on that opportunity? Meaning, do you expect a big portion of those will end up coming on to either a video platform like Zoom, Zoom Phone? Or will they start to just rely on their cell phones to make communication calls?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. Sterling. That's a great questions. As you see right in Q3 and a greater customer is like a carrier. And they expanded to deploy Zoom Phone and it\u2019s not a hundred and thousand, tens of a thousand deployment, right? So you look at the phone industry, right? I mean the clouds-based PBX industry, I think it's growing very well to replace legacy on-prem systems. Also, you look at those existing cloud-based phone providers, most of them develop a technologies stack many years ago. However, will those especially for large enterprise customers, when they migrate from on-prem to cloud, they do not want to deploy another solution, because the video and voice those two are converted into one service. In particular for those customers who already deployed Zoom Video platforms essentially technically Zoom Cloud\u2019s PBX system already there, we just need to enable and configure that. Otherwise, they are two fabulous solutions. That's why we have a high confidence that every time a lot of enterprise customers, they look at all those cloud-based phone solutions, Zoom always is the best choice. That's why I think the huge growth opportunity for our unified communication platform, video and voice together and to capture the wave of this cloud migration from on-prem to cloud.\nSterling Auty: 20:46 Got it. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: 20:47 Thank you.\nOperator: 20:50 Our next question is from Parker Lane with Stifel.\nParker Lane: 20:54 Thanks for taking my question. I was hoping you could dive into the video engagement center a little bit. The initial reception that customers have had to that solution and who do you ultimately envision the target customer will be here? Is it going to be more of lightweight small business, medium sized business that are looking for context that you are offering or do you envision taking it stream over time?\nEric Yuan: 21:15 Yeah. This is a good question. So we are very excited at Zoomtopia to announce our Zoom video engagement center. Because, the reason why we decided to invest resources on that is these are on our customers feedback. In terms of a gross trajectory, I would say it\u2019s very similar to what we did before for our Zoom Phone, right? We built a greater solution to leverage the same platform, and you can start up on existing customers, SME customers soon. Afterwards, you can roll it out to a lot of enterprise customers less our content center vision, right? Essentially, I think this market -- that contact center market is growing very well. However, a lot of enterprise customers, guess what, they still deployed on-premise solutions. For the next several years, I feel the opportunity is huge for us, right? Especially customers deployed Zoom Video and Phone together as an natural extension for our unified communication platform to help very significant and secure and the same platforms solution, which is our solution to the contact center space.\nParker Lane: 22:27 Got it. Thanks, Eric.\nEric Yuan: 22:29 Well, by the way, we do have quite a few greater customers in the pipeline.\nOperator: 22:37 Next question is from Taz Koujalgi with Guggenheim.\nTaz Koujalgi: 22:44 Hey, guys. Can you hear me okay?\nEric Yuan : 22:46 Yep.\nTaz Koujalgi: 22:46 I have a question for Kelly. Kelly can you can give us some more color on your mix of different products. We have had strong growth in Zoom Phone, Zoom Rooms for the last couple of quarters is the combination of phone plus rooms now, more than ten percent or that\u2019s still below ten percent of the overall business?\nKelly Steckelberg : 23:03 Sorry, it\u2019s a combination of Phone and Rooms.\nTaz Koujalgi: 23:06 For the non-meeting business is that less than ten or has it crossed ten percent threshold?\nKelly Steckelberg: 23:13 Well, none of our products segments on their own is greater than ten percent because it's likely that we would break that out if it were. If you add a few of them together, yes, there are a few of them, if we put them together, they would exceed greater than ten percent but on individual basis not any of them is greater than ten percent at this point.\nTaz Koujalgi: 23:33 Thanks. Thank you.\nOperator: 23:36 Next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: 23:41 Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask just about the traction of customer adds. We've seen the customer adds slow down a little bit. And just wondering how you think about kind of sales and marketing resources, directing them more towards upsells, which is clearly showing a lot of traction versus kind of new customer acquisition and just how you think about that in the budgeting practice and how we should think about that going forward?\nKelly Steckelberg: 24:11 Yeah. So it's exactly the strategy that we've been planning for and thinking about Meta when you think about Zoom Phone, for example, and Zoom Rooms, the strategy is to sell the existing install base, which by definition just means these customers are going to grow larger and larger and contribute more over time. 24:31 In the -- depending on which segment of our business, the up market business, the majors enterprise right, they work on account basis so they get to retain those accounts, which is great because they build these long term multi-year relationships with them, they understand their needs and they continue to grow those accounts as they continue to see what they need. And then in the lower, like, the mass market, we do have both expansion as well as acquisition teams have work really well, because that allows them to focus on growing. Certain teams to grow. But other teams to be really out there hunting and meeting add to our new logos. And then from a marketing perspective, we've grown so much as brand awareness, But now, we're really focusing on ensuring that everybody knows that every \u2013 meetings now also knows about phone and rooms and the other solutions we could we can bring to bear them.\nMeta Marshall: 25:23 Great. Thanks.\nOperator: 25:28 Next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: 25:31 Hey guys. Thanks for taking myquestion. So two -- one question, but it's multi part Kelly, and it\u2019s both for you, the question first is after the summer, how should we think about the visibility in the model, particularly around churn with the sub eleven cohort. And then if we look at the guidance that you gave implicitly for billings, it looks like it's about a six percent year over year growth. If I look at the guidance for revenue, it looks like nineteen percent growth, maybe there's some upside for that. Maybe it's over twenty. It's your toughest comp. But as investors start to look at next year, The street has you at seventeen percent So your implicit billings guide suggests potential for single digit growth. Is next quarter the trough that we start to build off of. I think that's a question. I'm getting at least from lot of investors.\nKelly Steckelberg: 26:25 So, in terms of -- let\u2019s talk about the churn versus, the visibility. And as we talked about on the Q2 call, that historical trends that we've seen in our business have changed pretty dramatically, but what we saw as we came through kind of the second half of Q3, was that some of the churn that we were experiencing earlier in the quarter was really summer seasonality. And as we saw people move back towards vacations kind of in the back half of September, that we saw that strength in that usage returning. So these are all learning that we would use now to apply to our modeling for FY twenty three as well as the fact that if you remember we looked at we showed you some of those detailed aging of the ten years of the cohorts at Analyst Day and as those continuing to aid that adds a lot of stability in that underlying business. And by next year, over fifty percent of them are going to have moved beyond sort of that fifteen month mark, which is where that churn really, really stabilizes. So that's really good news. In terms of the volatility going to continue to decrease over time. 27:36 In terms of Fy twenty three, I know that's the big question on everybody's mind, but you're going to hold any comments in terms of FY twenty guidance until Q4, at which point, of course, we are ready to get Q1 and full twenty three guidance.\nTom McCallum: 27:56 Who is next?\nOperator: 28:06 I\u2019m, sorry. Matt Stotler with William Blair. I was on mute.\nKelly Steckelberg: 28:10 Hi Matt.\nMatt Stotler: 28:11 Hi, everybody. Good to see you. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just one on the free user base. I know that you guys have always carried a number for free users and open that up during the pandemic. You've talked previously about thinking through monetizing the space of users, anything you can share in terms of I guess one one hand an update on the size of that base, potential opportunity and then updates on how you're thinking about the ability to monetize it over time.\nKelly Steckelberg: 28:40 Eric, you want to talk about monetization of free users over time?\nEric Yuan: 28:43 Yes sure. So Matt, first of all when we started free user base is always like a marketing platform to promote of brand and give us a network effectiveness of our service platform. So that's how we introduced the pre service premium and forty minutes limitation. I think for now, given the brand recognition and given what had happened in last year, I think we got to take a step back to look at our free user online business. Right? And essentially on the one hand we would like to double down our enterprise market, of course, that business is growing extremely well. On the other hand, we got to be very accretive to look at how we lever our huge free user installer dates. Right, All over the work. Right? We started like the advertisement program for free users from international market and downloading a work and look at that as well because not only do we fix on the kind of conversion rate, front trade to pay it and that's not of a traditional model. Right? We got be creating the huge opportunity and two thing about how to modify that free user base differently. I think that's -- I think a team have put a lot of efforts on that and that's something we are very excited.\nMatt Stotler: 30:09 Thank you.\nEric Yuan: 30:10 Thank you, Matt.\nKelly Steckelberg: 30:10 Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: 30:12 Next question is from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: 30:17 Thanks for taking my question. Just want to ask about your investment on go to market side. So as you are coming off of this too strong renewal quarters, what are the areas you are investing right now? And as you're normalized growth rate. Is there certain vigilance or certain verticals so could you give some kind of color on that?\nKelly Steckelberg: 30:37 Yeah. We certainly are continuing to invest in sales organization, especially outside of the U.S. There you\u2019ve seen strong growth in international, and we really have the opportunity to continue to leverage the brand awareness and grown significantly not only in the U. S, but also globally. And so that's a huge opportunity for us as well as ensuring that we have the right sales team to support Zoom Events, Zoom Phone and soon our video engagement center as well. So those are all the areas and that's what we are thinking about, especially for FY twenty three.\nSiti Panigrahi: 31:16 Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: 31:18 Thank you, Siti.\nOperator: 31:20 Next we have Ryan Mcwilliams with Barclays.\nRyan Mcwilliams: 31:24 Hey, Good to see you guys again. Kelly, just on your existing customer growth. Anything to called out there maybe into the fourth quarter? And I would imagine meetings still makes up the bulk of your growth with existing customers, but anything to call out maybe in the changing mix between meetings versus phone and rooms with these existing customers? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: 31:48 I mean, Zoom Phone continues to be a really strong growth driver in general, especially as organizations are thinking about what's going to be their future of work strategy and enabling their employees to work from anywhere over time. And then Zoom Rooms, of course, is also really important consideration now as companies are thinking about welcoming their employees back in the office. The conference room strategy has become even more important than it was pre-pandemic as we gets unlikely -- unlike we were all going to be sitting around in conference rooms together in the future. And so having any sort of a hybrid approach means that you need to make sure that it's inclusive and the best way to do that is through the Zoom Rooms technology, things like Smart Gallery, which are really some of the opportunities that we're helping our customers solve today.\nEric Yuan: 32:41 So just quickly to add on what Kelly side, Ryan. If out look at hybrid work, the conference room is extremely important. That's why you can the Zoom Rooms, right? It\u2019s uniquely positioned, it\u2019s much better than any other solution in order to support a hybrid world. Not only -- not to mention the Zoom Events also can support the new hybrid events, the service as well. Right? That's why you know huge opportunity for us to support a hybrid work in paradigm shift.\nRyan Mcwilliams: 33:12 Yes.\nKelly Steckelberg: 33:13 Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: 33:15 Next question is from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: 33:20 Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Kelly, I wanted to ask you about just some of your comments on the churn rates. I guess, first, did they perform in line with your expectations this quarter? Just kind of giving the moving pieces with summer seasonality. And then as you think about Q4 would you expect churn rates to get better because of less kind of summer seasonality in Europe? And then I just wanted to clarify when you talked about the online business being a headwind, does that mean that you expect the online revenue to decline year over year? Does it just mean it's going to grow slower than the rest of the business?\nKelly Steckelberg: 33:59 So, in terms of how the online churn performed in Q3, it performed better than our expectations coming in at the beginning of the quarter. And we were happy to see that it was more seasonality aligned rather than true potential departures as people were making other choices of going back to meeting in person. The seasonality nature of that was good news to see and we are rebounding in the middle in -- kind of in the middle to the back half of September. And then we expect Q4 to be relatively consistent with Q3 in terms of churn. However, we do see some impact from the holidays towards the end of December. And those holidays vary by the global by global location, but we do see kind of slowdown based on that. 34:59 In terms of what we expect from online going forward. We do expect online revenue to grow more slowly than the direct and channel business as we look to the future, which is what we saw in Q3, for example, as well. But we'll give more specifics around that when we give guidance on the Q4 call.\nTyler Radke: 35:18 Thank you.\nOperator: 35:21 Next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: 35:24 Hey, guys. Nice quarter. I just wanted to go back Matt's question on advertising, first, how would this actually work? Can you give more color there? Would it be kind of banner within the application pre or post video and be more display based advertising or performance based? And then also just wanted to understand how much of this is really to try prevent some of your more commercial and enterprise customers from lowering their number of meeting seats to free seats rather than just trying to monetize more that online consumer ebay. Thanks.\nEric Yuan: 35:57 James. So, for now we're just focused on the pure free meetings. Right? Meaning that meaning halls, while we will have meeting all the free participant. Let\u2019s say, if you and I joined the meeting because we already paid the enterprise customer or predecessor, we will not show that this at. Right? It is more like a post -- post meeting attentive page, right? Because we do have, in some plants, but we want to start step by step gradually right. For now I\u2019m sure that these free ads that are posted in the page from international market is purely for the frame meetings, and they try to do learn and, some express. And again, we got to be creative that's so many areas where we can be creative. Right? Because you got a data meeting participant, you in a of a number of for you, this is pretty healthy. Even for those best users, right? Maybe if it's not pay for our service anymore. They still use our service. Right? That's why the meaning is, Zoom still offers for good to while of. We got do think about how to monetize it differently. Again, this is something you pass, and we would like to explore more in the next few quarters.\nJames Fish: 37:12 Thanks, Eric.\nEric Yuan: 37:13 Thank you.\nOperator: 37:16 Next question is from Rishi Jaluria With RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: 37:21 Hey, Eric and Kelly, good to see you both. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask about Zoom Chat. I was really excited to see that launched at Zoomtopia two months ago, really kind of sawing this vision of becoming this broader enterprise communication platform. I actually noticed that the Zoom Chat is live, it's something people can deploy. I know it's an add-on feature, can you give us any sense of color in terms of customers actually using it today, what that sort of usage within your existing customer base looks like? And what you're doing to actually drive usage of Zoom Chat among your customers to just make the whole platform more valuable to them? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: 37:58 Yeah. Rishi, that\u2019s a good question. First of all, I can tell you Zoom as a company, we're using our Chat for a long time and so many employees do enjoy that. And overall, this is a part of our overall platform vision because some customer I think do a good job to mission that and promote data because customer -- some customer even do not know that, right, before, But however, if we look at our chat usage, sorry, we did not publish that number yet, it\u2019s pretty healthy not only for SMB individual users, but also enterprise customer. They deployed both video and phone and also Zoom Chat is one platform. Right? And in terms of functionalities, scalability, I think we have a high confidence. On one hand, we do collaborate well with other chat solutions and we integrate very well, on the other hand for some customers they really want to deploy the solution for one vendor for video, voice and chat. We do have this flexibility. I think also our team, we are innovating as well. Right? I know adding more and more very cool functionalities right, as are announced at Zoomtopia. Again, this is something important for our overall UC platform, and we are going to invest more.\nRishi Jaluria: 39:12 Alright. Wonderful. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: 39:13 Thank you.\nOperator: 39:16 Our next question is from Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: 39:21 Okay, Great. Maybe Kelly, metrics like deferred revenues and RPO are certainly not the most important to watch with Zoom, but they can be indicative of changes in the business, so it's still important to keep an eye on them. And you made some color about DR and RPO next quarter that I'd love if you could elaborate. I think on DR you mentioned that it'll grow mid-twenties due to a cyclical decline in average remaining term of annual contracts. I'm not sure I totally understand what that means. So I'd love to ask for a clarification. And then likely as well on RPO, you mentioned that we would see a shift back to long term plans. I'm wondering if you could elaborate on that as well. Thanks so much.\nKelly Steckelberg: 40:05 Yes. So for deferred revenue, there's two things to remember, which is the seasonality trend of our renewal is that Q1 is the largest quarter for renewals and Q4 is the lowest. So, in terms of new deferred coming on to the books, Q4 is the lowest quarter because of that, as well as the fact that Q1 is the largest quarter when deferred gets out of the balance sheet, but they are annual contracts, by the time you get to Q4 most of that has already been amortized and recognized. There is only twenty five percent of it in theory about left when you come into the quarter. So the combination of the fact that anything added in Q1 is almost fully amortized and will get refilled and renewed back in Q1. And the fact that Q4 is the lowest renewal quarter, those two things are what's driving this trend of renewals. -- Sorry, of deferred, which I know is probably counter intuitive to any other company that you see because of the seasonality that we have. 41:04 So if you remember at Analyst Day, we showed you an actual chart that shows how our renewals layout out for the year, and that's what that illustrates and so renewals, like deferred is kind of look the same, collection is going to look the same because they're all being built off of that trend. Does that makes sense?\nKarl Keirstead: 41:25 Yes. And so the fact that DR growth would slow to mid-twenties is due to what?\nKelly Steckelberg: 41:30 It's due to the fact that Q4 is our lowest renewal period as well as all those annual renewals that came on in Q1, which is the biggest quarter are now almost fully amortized and recognized.\nKarl Keirstead: 41:45 Okay? That's helpful. Thank you on DR. And one RPO Kelly?\nKelly Steckelberg: 41:49 And then this has a strong impact on billings and RPO as well, because the same thing like they are adding to the building of the collections are happening earlier in the quarter and the remaining term is being amortized throughout the year, so there is -- it's the short amount of contract left during Q4.\nKarl Keirstead: 42:12 Okay. I think I got it. Thanks for the participation. I appreciate it.\nKelly Steckelberg: 42:16 Okay. You are very welcome.\nOperator: 42:18 The next question is from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities.\nShebly Seyrafi: 42:23 Yeah. Thank you very much. So what is your latest thinking about possibly reviving the five million dollars deal sets us with a higher price and what you're current thinking about the build versus buy decision in the contact center market?\nEric Yuan: 42:39 Shebly, that's a good question and unfortunately Rowan is not in the call. That's why, probably for both of us to answer this question. But anyway, we look at everything form a customer perspective. Even this field did not go through forever, and we still have many mutual customers and we have a great integration with Five9. And also, I think from that perspective everything is same as before. Right? But in terms of the deal, actually nobody knows that and let's see, we do not know, but also as I mentioned earlier, right and we have a full stack to support unified communication. Important, the customer deployed the Zoom Video already, they may do have deploy in Zoom Phone. We also asked about our strategy about our content center solution. And this reason why know we're are doubling down out video engagement center, which is our answer to the contact center solution. Anyway, I think this is where we are now, but I'm so sorry, it\u2019s really harder to know how to reengage or do the deal with Five9, because it will probably compliment. And again -- and for now, we are doubling down on our video engagement center and also working to together with all other contact center solution providers like Five9 a better integration, seamless express to our mutual customers.\nShebly Seyrafi: 44:06 Okay. Thanks.\nEric Yuan: 44:07 Thank you.\nOperator: 44:10 Next question is from Matthew VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: 44:16 Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I guess pertaining to the channel and especially with Zoom Phone, are you seeing much traction in terms of potential net new customers coming in where Zoom Phone is sort of the entree into that customer? Or even as a part of initial deal, especially at the sort of mid-market enterprise level? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: 44:41 Yes. Go ahead, Kelly.\nKelly Steckelberg: 44:47 So, yes, we have absolutely seen the channel be a really important part and a really important growth driver for Zoom Phone, especially. This is why focusing on the channel both in the U.S and growing that internationally is really an important aspect of our growth strategy for the long term here as well. And then we do have the ability and we have seen customers that want to start to sell and start with Zoom Phone first and that has been a great opportunity, it\u2019s a small percentage of our customers that are starting that way but it\u2019s a great opportunity for them if that's what they're interested in to get them in and get them used to Zoom and then expand over time in terms of understanding the full platform offering that we have.\nMatthew VanVliet: 45:31 Thank you.\nOperator: 45:34 Next question is from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: 45:39 Hey, thanks for taking the question. I want to go back to the question before that was asked. Not necessarily related to 59, but having moved past that acquisition, maybe Eric how you're thinking about inorganic opportunities on either the UCaaS or the CCaaS front to really consolidate the market and expand your platform inorganically relative to some of the organic investments the company\u2019s talked about? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: 46:04 Matt, again, actually, Five9 is still a great partner and Rowan and the team is great. They have a good -- they're friends, right? So we still working together right, you to talk the mutual customer. That's for sure. Regarding our gross strategy for consolidate UCaaS and CCaaS, first of all, I think we are doing very well on UCaaS. In terms of CCaaS the reason why we're announced the video engagement center, because of that, right? Because for some customer, they want to consolidate it together, and we do have an offering also how to accelerate our growth in addition to allocating our own resources to grow that business organically for sure, right, if there's any good, let's say, technology platform for next generation functionalities very accretive features, well we're open minded, right? 46:52 And Kelly has a big budget to support that effort. Again if you know of any other cool technology companies that can't help us for the beef up of investment on that front we're open minded.\nMatthew Niknam: 47:12 Great. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: 47:12 Thank you.\nOperator: 47:16 Next question is from Will Power with Baird.\nWill Power: 47:20 Great. Good afternoon. So, Eric, you referenced a number of new customer wins, you really called out Terry, I guess, in particular, and you suggested it was an extensive process, so really just love to better understand the importance of the bundle video and Zoom Phone foe carrier and what your estimation really kind of set you apart the other vendors they were considering?\nEric Yuan: 47:44 That's a good question. So, first of all, I'd like to take a step back to share how we grow our platforms, it\u2019s not like some other cloud vendors, probably we targeted those traditional on prem solutions. Our Zoom Phone growth comes from not only for on-prem, the growth, also for other existing cloud-based phone solutions. They probably also see it with us, right? And we have both -- those customers coming from both side. And aside from that, for a lot of enterprise customers, in particular for our existing Zoom Video customers, we need look at the phone, this is very enterprise customer so very complex environment, probably they have multiple on premise solutions. They want to be very careful. They wanted to, you know, partner with a company with a vision, with reliability, security plus they also want to make sure video and voice those two can be converged and already test our service and realized and based on the criteria, Zoom is the only solution that can truly satisfy their needs. However, the process is pretty long, because again, enterprise phone deployment is very complex. And even with our existing customers, we want to be very careful. But after we go through the RFP process, Zoom is best positioned. Right? I think we see that very often over the past several quarters. I think that will be probably the pattern for the future, and growth as well. Because we have a high confidence as long as enterprise customers nobody saw complex they're existing on prem phone systems now, as long as the process embedded solutions. I think we have high confidence they are going to go with our solution.\nWill Power: 49:29 Okay. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: 49:31 Thank you.\nOperator: 49:33 Next question is from Patrick Walravens with JMP.\nPatrick Walravens: 49:37 Oh, great. Thank you. Hey, Eric, what would you say was your primary source of competitive differentiation as a video conferencing solution a while ago. And what would you say it is today is a communications platform?\nEric Yuan: 49:54 So, Patrick, that's a good question. When it comes to conferencing it itself, I would say, it sounds very easy, but however it\u2019s really hard. Because it just works, right? And that's reason why our customer lack on platform. Even if some of the competitors try to add features, guess what? And you've got to make it work anytime any device. Take this earning call for example. How many of our competitors dare to host earning call on this platform. We're free, right? The reason why we have a confidence is not only only Zoom, but also some of our customers like my greater friend [indiscernible]. They also hosted earnings cast on Zoom platform because of very reliable greater video, audio quality, a lot of other -- video features like early next year we are going to announce other networks' functionality. And Patrick, you can show up as your digital avatar, right, if you want to, right? I think on the one hand, I think reliability, it works anywhere anytime and plus, always be the first window to come up with innovation. That's the reason why we are winning on that space. I think in the future, I would see more and more innovations and prices supported by development platform, the way you see platform also will keep us maybe leapfrog our competitors. Because again, as -- it's not like you have a fifty or one hundred percent UC, you can develop something similar. It\u2019s not like that, a huge investment to be on par with our platform.\nPatrick Walravens: 51:28 It just works?\nEric Yuan: 51:29 It just works, it's just three words, It's not that -- it's pretty hard.\nOperator: 51:38 Next question is from Steve Andrews with Keybanc.\nSteve Enders: 51:43 Okay, great. Thanks for taking the question here. I just want to check back on the carrier deal and how that came together. It sounds like on the front portion it got a large portion of the seat base there. But I guess, what would it take for Zoom Phone to be deployed within that customer. And I guess, what are kind of the learnings of that as you apply that to other customers that are considering Zoom Phone?\nEric Yuan: 52:08 I think first of all, for very a large enterprise customers, in particular for those customers who deploy multiple, very complex on-premise, which is the sell cycle for Zoom Phone, right? It's not only just one on-prem to cloud, right? There's a lot of solutions, not to mention we need the support of the global participant, right? However, I think that Zoom solution is much better positioned, I think it normally a little longer time competed to Zoom meeting platform from deployed. I think we just need to focus on our product innovation and adopting our go to market and then actually more, more very complex enterprise deployment like carrier. They are going to migrate to Zoom platform. Again, I think it'll takes some time, interested enough, that some of our customers that even do not know Zoom Phone platform. Right. And however, after they know and test our platform, Zoom solution did much better than any other cloud solutions. You know, we have very, very high confidence. Because again, it is not a kind of thousands, those are ten of a thousand, very complex global footprint. it does demonstrate our Zoom Phone capability.\nSteve Enders: 53:27 Great. Thanks for taking the question here.\nEric Yuan: 53:29 Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: 53:32 Next question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron: 53:40 Yeah. Hey, guys. I good to see you. I guess I was hoping to focus on the Global two thousand. Clearly, that was a big part of your focus going forward. And that's where a lot of the sales resources have been investing in over the past year. Maybe you can give us an update on how penetrated are you at this point with the Global two thousand? And has the competition change within in that category? And the reason I'm asking is that Cisco clearly has made a lot of progress in the past year with Webex and they've felt to be even more aggressive in protecting that perfectly. That is mainly their focus there. How do you feel about the competitive landscape there? What have changed and what you can say about progress today with global two thousands?\nEric Yuan: 54:32 [Multiple Speaker] Yeah. You address the Global two thousand. Yeah.\nKelly Steckelberg: 54:36 So in terms of the progress that we're making, we continue to make progress there as we talked about earlier. devoting resources to international expansion and focus on this is still an opportunity, we are at still slightly under twenty percent of the global 2K that are spending more than one hundred thousand dollars a year with us, which just means that there's a huge opportunity ahead for us.\nEric Yuan: 55:02 So, Ittai, in terms of our competitive landscape. It's just purely look at video conferencing service. I think Zoom is a go to platform. And I think I really did not see any other vendors, even for the platform we mentioned IPOed before. I do not think that there is any competitor even, close to what we can offer. But in terms of the unified communication as a platform not only for meeting -- video conferencing but the meeting CCaaS. I think for now we have a huge opportunity if you look at our phone growth, right? And essentially, especially for our enterprise customs, they are not going to deploy multiple solutions for multiple vendors, very likely two vendors, right, probably for enterprise customers. It's a sort of a standard. 55:54 This zoom is very well positioned compared to any other -- the competitors. We do not see anything changed because, again, it's not like you can hold all features here and there. And underlying technology, right, that need many years' effort, right? And it\u2019s totally a different architecture, reliability and security, and also all those innovations. That's reason why I think Zoom is much better positioned. I really do not see any other competitor, and that's \u2013 coming in business space over the past two years.\nIttai Kidron: 56:30 Very good. Thanks, guys.\nEric Yuan: 56:32 Thank you.\nOperator: 56:35 Next question is from Ryan Koontz with Needham.\nRyan Koontz: 56:40 Thanks. One for Eric if i could. With regards to the Ericsson acquisition of Vonage today, this bring APIs to the 5G network. Do you see this as disruptive to the CPaaS industry, and how do Zoom think about the evolution of video APIs with programmable 5G phone.\nEric Yuan: 56:56 Yeah. I saw that news last night, and I\u2019m not still digesting that news. First of all, I would say, congratulations to Vonage and the team. And the hard work has very pretty paid off. And Ericsson is a great company. I think probably this is greater acquisition. And again, we are still digesting this news, but from our perspective, and I think our vision is very, very clear, right? We are focused on enterprise for use of stack, video, voice, CCaaS, events, Zoom Rooms through fully supportive hybrid work. Right? And Ericson is a great company and probably this will help us them solidify their position for 5G and also help for their cloud vision as well. And that's -- pretty much, what I think about it.\nRyan Koontz: 57:45 Thank you. Eric.\nEric Yuan: 57:47 Thank you.\nOperator: 57:49 Next question is from Chaim Siegel with Elazar Advisors.\nKelly Steckelberg: 57:57 You are on mute. There we go.\nChaim Siegel: 57:56 Sorry about that. I wanted to just talk to you about -- you started talking about sequential growth a couple of quarters ago, and you talked about it last quarter and just how you're thinking about that because this quarter was a little bit slower, but I don't know how much seasonality plays into it and I know you said you're not talking about next year, but since we have these crazy comparisons, I just wanted to know how to think about sequential growth and what's driving it?\nKelly Steckelberg: 58:38 Yeah. So, we will reiterate what we said earlier in the prepared remarks is that, we continue to see strong growth in the direct and the channel business. And that grew it twice the rate of the online business what we saw in Q3. And the online business will expect to be a headwind as we're still having these online customers which are the most volatile, many of them are still on monthly contracts. And as they are adjusting to the environment and figuring out how the future of work is going to be for them individually, We expect that to be the challenging headwind, then in Q4 you'll see a little bit of holiday seasonality as we talked about too.\nChaim Siegel: 59:30 Thank you.\nOperator: 59:33 Next question is from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: 59:37 Hey there. Thanks for squeezing me in. Nice to see everyone. I like the first backgrounds. No one's known tonight have but they're nice? Clearly extended period of impressive growth. I wanted to just ask around what's next and how you balance staying efficient while staying aggressive, you're still spending around six point five percent in R&D five point five billion dollars in cash in the balance sheet. So what's that profile, how do you balance staying on offense given all the market opportunities you have in front of you. And does the mindset shift at all as some of the growth rates moderate? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: 60:09 Yeah. I mean, I can tell you that in terms of investing in areas like R&D and products specifically, we are still not even spending at the level we would like to be, our target for that is approximately ten percent so they still have a ways to go. They've come a long way in terms of hiring and investing there, but we still have more opportunity to expand both the products and the engineering team. And then sales as well, sales and marketing, we still see opportunity to continue add sales capacity on a global basis. The areas that were very, very thoughtful about adding additional investments and then wanting to do that in a very efficient way, of course, is COGS, we work very closely with Tommy and his team to make sure that we're adding capacity \u2013 we want to make sure that we have the right capacity for our customers, but doing that as efficiently as possible. And then, of course, G&A we want to do everything we can within our G&A functions to support our internal and external customers, but to do that also as efficient as we can. So that's kind of how we think about investing. So operating for grow still in R&D and sales, but trying to drive efficiency through COGS and G&A.\nMichael Turrin: 61:22 Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: 61:26 Our last question today is from Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark.\nMatthew Harrigan: 61:31 Well, thank you. You pretty much elucidated the block and tackling you saw. I have one more expansive question for you. I know you're pretty constructive on AR and DR in the longer term, while recognizing all the way limiting steps for consumer adoption. We've always talked about the metaverse, all the buzz and it really feels sometimes when people have no concepts, even what it is. Can you add any thoughts on that and what the potential opportunity for Zoom is over say three five year period. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: 62:05 Matt, that\u2019s a great question. First of all, we like metaverse because our team already working on that for a while. The reason why our vision is to deliver a better video conference, even than a face to face in-person meeting. Right? And AR and DR is part of that. Our team already work on that. Right? You know, how to get it, that will probably take many years effort. For now this is very concept with a great story, right? And like a digital avatar, right? We demonstrated that functionality at Zoomtopia. Next year, we are going to have something like that I think there's more step-by-step to get there. Again we already are started it before, right? But we are not going to offer a hardware platform, we're going to partner with other vendors, like Facebook and any others, and we offer the software layer, because does fit very well to our vision. In the future with that AR or VR or metaverse, maybe the future metaverse. You and I can shake hands remotely. Seriously right? I talked about it three years ago, and we already adding resources before. That's why we're very excited, finally the word as our matter was. But guess what, we already started working on them for a while. Vision wise, it's very well. That's why we're very excited back into macro questions. Right where we are in the invest. We already invested that. We are just going to double down on that. Because, again, it fits very well to our company vision and a matter where we play a big it will follow-up future innovation.\nMichael Turrin: 63:35 Thank you.\nEric Yuan: 63:36 Thank you.\nTom McCallum: 63:40 Eric, that was our last question. So back to you.\nEric Yuan: 63:43 Oh! Thank you all. Really appreciate you time, and I\u2019d like to take this opportunity to thank all Zoom employees, all the customers, partners and investors. Wish you all have a wonderful holiday season. Thanks -- happiest Thanksgiving. Thank you all for your time, I\u2019m so grateful. Thank you.\nA - Kelly Steckelberg: 64:00 Hi everybody. Thank you.\nA - Eric Yuan: 64:03 Thanks everybody.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "08:05 Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. Let me start by reviewing our financial results for Q3 and then discuss our outlook for Q4. 08:16 In Q3, total revenue grew thirty five percent year over year to one point zero five billion dollars, exceeding the high end of our guidance of one point zero two billion dollars. The growth was primarily driven by strength in our direct and channel businesses, which grew at twice the rate of our online business, as well as improved churn in both online and direct segments. 08:39 From a product perspective, we saw strong demand for Zoom Video Webinars, Zoom Rooms, and Zoom Phone. Zoom Phone had year-over-year revenue growth in the triple-digits and reached thirty customers with over twn thousand paid seats. The year-over-year growth in revenue for the quarter was driven by a healthy mix between new and existing customers, with existing customers accounting for twenty six percent of the incremental revenue, up from nineteen percent a year ago. 09:11 Let's take a look at the key customer metrics for the quarter. We saw ninety four percent year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with two thousand five hundred and seven customers generating more than one hundred thousand dollars in trailing twelve months revenue. These customers represented twenty two percent of revenue, up from eighteen percent in Q3 of last year. We exited the quarter with approximately five hundred and twelve thousand one hundred customers with more than ten employees, up eighteen percent year over year. 09:46 In Q3 customers with more than ten employees represented sixty six percent of revenue, up from six -- excuse me, sixty four percent last quarter, and sixty two percent in Q3 of last year. These trends suggest that our customers with more than ten employees are expanding their use of our platform and adding more products and seats, aligned with our go-to-market strategy. 10:12 Our net dollar expansion rate for customers with more than ten employees exceeded one hundred and thirty percent for the fourteenth consecutive quarter as existing customers increased their spend with Zoom and we saw strong upsells of Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms. For Q4, we expect this metric to be modestly below one hundred and thirty percent mark as the denominator of this trailing twelve month metric reflects a significant growth in our customer base. 10:41 Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Our Americas revenue grew thirty percent year over year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew forty seven percent year over year to be approximately thirty three percent of revenue, up from thirty one percent a year ago. On a quarter over quarter basis, Asia Pacific had another strong quarter driven by growth in Australia and Japan and bolstered by the investments we have made in our international team. However, as we discussed in Q2, we saw headwinds to our online business in EMEA, mainly related to summer seasonality. 11:23 Now, turning to profitability which was strong from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains on strategic investments, and undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities. 11:51 Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was seventy six percent, an improvement from sixty eight point two percent in Q3 of last year and stable with Q2 of this year. We remain committed to our multi-year strategy of building out our data centers to support further improvements in gross margin. 12:12 Research and development expense grew by one hundred and sixty nine percent year over year to approximately sixty eight million dollars. On a sequential basis, we added over thirteen million dollars in R&D expense, primarily due to expansion within our engineering and product teams globally. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense doubled year over year to six point four percent demonstrating our commitment to innovation and product development. 12:40 Sales and marketing expense grew by sixty eight percent year over year to two thirty seven million dollars or approximately twenty two point six percent of total revenue, primarily driven by increased marketing programs and sales headcount to drive future growth. We remain committed to investing in global sales capacity and marketing across our core and new products. 13:03 G&A expense grew by twelve percent to eighty two million dollars or approximately seven point eight percent of total revenue. This was lower than Q3 of last year as we expanded our G&A functions prudently to meet our new sales. 13:19 The revenue upside in the quarter carried through to the bottom line, with non-GAAP operating income of four hundred and eleven million dollars exceeding the high end of our guidance of three forty five million dollars. This translates to a thirty nine point one non-GAAP operating margin for Q3 compared with thirty seven point four percent a year ago and forty one point six percent last quarter. 13:44 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was one point one one dollars on approximately three hundred and six million non-GAAP weighted average shares of outstanding. This result is zero point zero three dollars above the high end of our guidance and zero point one two dollars above Q3 of last year. 14:02 This result includes a seventy million dollars provision for income tax, a significant increase from last year, mainly due to fully utilizing our NOLs as well as a decrease in our stock-based compensation for tax purposes. 14:19 Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was one point two billion dollars, up thirty nine percent year over year from eight fifty five million dollars, and slightly up quarter over quarter. Looking at Q4, we expect the year-over-year growth rate in deferred revenue to be in the mid twenty. This is driven by the cyclical decline in the average remaining term of our annual customer contracts, which are front-half weighted. 14:50 Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately two point five billion dollars, up fifty one percent year over year from one point six billion dollars. We expect to recognize approximately sixty seven percent of the total RPO as revenue over the next twelve months, as compared to seventy two percent in Q3 of last year, reflecting a shift back towards longer term plans. 15:17 We ended the quarter with approximately five point four billion dollars in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of three hundred and ninety five million dollars, as compared to four hundred and eleven million dollars in Q3 of last year. Free cash flow was three seventy five million dollars, as compared to three eighty eight million dollars in Q3 of last year. 15:42 It's important to note that as we progress beyond the initial phases of the pandemic growth and continue to invest to support our new scale, our working capital is normalizing. In Q4, we expect to incur a one-time eighty five million dollar cash outflow related to a legal settlement, which we disclosed and booked as a GAAP expense in Q1. As a reminder, due to the seasonality of renewals being front-end loaded and tapering through the year, our collections will follow the same trend. We also expand CapEx investments in building out our data centers to support future gross margin expansion. 16:26 Now, turning to guidance. We are pleased to raise our outlook for FY twenty twenty two. This outlook is based on our current assessment of the business environment. Specifically, it assumes that our direct and channel business will continue to grow, while our online business will be a headwind in the coming quarters as smaller customers and consumers adapt to the evolving environment. 16:49 For the fourth quarter of FY twenty twenty two, we expect revenue to be in the range of one point zero five one billion dollars to one point zero five three billion dollars. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of three sixty one million dollars to three hundred and sixty three million dollars. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is one point zero six dollar to one point zero seven dollar based on approximately three hundred and seven million shares outstanding and a tax rate of approximately ten percent. 17:20 Due to our multi-year history of profitability, we have fully utilized our NOLs. We expect our tax rate to approximate the U.S. blended tax rate in FY twenty twenty three. For the full year of FY twenty twenty two, we expect revenue to be in the range of four point zero seven nine to four point zero eight one billion dollars, which would represent approximately fifty four percent year-over-year growth, up from our previous guidance of fifty one percent issued in August. 17:51 We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately one point five nine eight dollars to one point six billion dollars which would represent approximately sixty three percent year-over-year growth. Our outlook for the non-GAAP earnings per share is. 18:03 Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is four point eight four dollars to four point eight five dollars based on approximately three hundred and six million shares outstanding. As always, Zoom is grateful to be a driving force enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless and secure communications platform. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors 18:34 Matt, please queue up our first question. 23:03 Sorry, it's a combination of Phone and Rooms. 23:13 Well, none of our products segments on their own is greater than ten percent because it's likely that we would break that out if it were. If you add a few of them together, yes, there are a few of them, if we put them together, they would exceed greater than ten percent but on individual basis not any of them is greater than ten percent at this point. 24:11 Yeah. So it's exactly the strategy that we've been planning for and thinking about Meta when you think about Zoom Phone, for example, and Zoom Rooms, the strategy is to sell the existing install base, which by definition just means these customers are going to grow larger and larger and contribute more over time. 24:31 In the -- depending on which segment of our business, the up market business, the majors enterprise right, they work on account basis so they get to retain those accounts, which is great because they build these long term multi-year relationships with them, they understand their needs and they continue to grow those accounts as they continue to see what they need. And then in the lower, like, the mass market, we do have both expansion as well as acquisition teams have work really well, because that allows them to focus on growing. Certain teams to grow. But other teams to be really out there hunting and meeting add to our new logos. And then from a marketing perspective, we've grown so much as brand awareness, But now, we're really focusing on ensuring that everybody knows that every \u2013 meetings now also knows about phone and rooms and the other solutions we could we can bring to bear them. 26:25 So, in terms of -- let's talk about the churn versus, the visibility. And as we talked about on the Q2 call, that historical trends that we've seen in our business have changed pretty dramatically, but what we saw as we came through kind of the second half of Q3, was that some of the churn that we were experiencing earlier in the quarter was really summer seasonality. And as we saw people move back towards vacations kind of in the back half of September, that we saw that strength in that usage returning. So these are all learning that we would use now to apply to our modeling for FY twenty three as well as the fact that if you remember we looked at we showed you some of those detailed aging of the ten years of the cohorts at Analyst Day and as those continuing to aid that adds a lot of stability in that underlying business. And by next year, over fifty percent of them are going to have moved beyond sort of that fifteen month mark, which is where that churn really, really stabilizes. So that's really good news. In terms of the volatility going to continue to decrease over time. 27:36 In terms of Fy twenty three, I know that's the big question on everybody's mind, but you're going to hold any comments in terms of FY twenty guidance until Q4, at which point, of course, we are ready to get Q1 and full twenty three guidance. 28:10 Hi Matt. 28:40 Eric, you want to talk about monetization of free users over time? 30:10 Thanks, Matt. 30:37 Yeah. We certainly are continuing to invest in sales organization, especially outside of the U.S. There you've seen strong growth in international, and we really have the opportunity to continue to leverage the brand awareness and grown significantly not only in the U. S, but also globally. And so that's a huge opportunity for us as well as ensuring that we have the right sales team to support Zoom Events, Zoom Phone and soon our video engagement center as well. So those are all the areas and that's what we are thinking about, especially for FY twenty three. 31:18 Thank you, Siti. 31:48 I mean, Zoom Phone continues to be a really strong growth driver in general, especially as organizations are thinking about what's going to be their future of work strategy and enabling their employees to work from anywhere over time. And then Zoom Rooms, of course, is also really important consideration now as companies are thinking about welcoming their employees back in the office. The conference room strategy has become even more important than it was pre-pandemic as we gets unlikely -- unlike we were all going to be sitting around in conference rooms together in the future. And so having any sort of a hybrid approach means that you need to make sure that it's inclusive and the best way to do that is through the Zoom Rooms technology, things like Smart Gallery, which are really some of the opportunities that we're helping our customers solve today. 33:13 Thanks, Ryan. 33:59 So, in terms of how the online churn performed in Q3, it performed better than our expectations coming in at the beginning of the quarter. And we were happy to see that it was more seasonality aligned rather than true potential departures as people were making other choices of going back to meeting in person. The seasonality nature of that was good news to see and we are rebounding in the middle in -- kind of in the middle to the back half of September. And then we expect Q4 to be relatively consistent with Q3 in terms of churn. However, we do see some impact from the holidays towards the end of December. And those holidays vary by the global by global location, but we do see kind of slowdown based on that. 34:59 In terms of what we expect from online going forward. We do expect online revenue to grow more slowly than the direct and channel business as we look to the future, which is what we saw in Q3, for example, as well. But we'll give more specifics around that when we give guidance on the Q4 call. 40:05 Yes. So for deferred revenue, there's two things to remember, which is the seasonality trend of our renewal is that Q1 is the largest quarter for renewals and Q4 is the lowest. So, in terms of new deferred coming on to the books, Q4 is the lowest quarter because of that, as well as the fact that Q1 is the largest quarter when deferred gets out of the balance sheet, but they are annual contracts, by the time you get to Q4 most of that has already been amortized and recognized. There is only twenty five percent of it in theory about left when you come into the quarter. So the combination of the fact that anything added in Q1 is almost fully amortized and will get refilled and renewed back in Q1. And the fact that Q4 is the lowest renewal quarter, those two things are what's driving this trend of renewals. -- Sorry, of deferred, which I know is probably counter intuitive to any other company that you see because of the seasonality that we have. 41:04 So if you remember at Analyst Day, we showed you an actual chart that shows how our renewals layout out for the year, and that's what that illustrates and so renewals, like deferred is kind of look the same, collection is going to look the same because they're all being built off of that trend. Does that makes sense? 41:30 It's due to the fact that Q4 is our lowest renewal period as well as all those annual renewals that came on in Q1, which is the biggest quarter are now almost fully amortized and recognized. 41:49 And then this has a strong impact on billings and RPO as well, because the same thing like they are adding to the building of the collections are happening earlier in the quarter and the remaining term is being amortized throughout the year, so there is -- it's the short amount of contract left during Q4. 42:16 Okay. You are very welcome. 44:47 So, yes, we have absolutely seen the channel be a really important part and a really important growth driver for Zoom Phone, especially. This is why focusing on the channel both in the U.S and growing that internationally is really an important aspect of our growth strategy for the long term here as well. And then we do have the ability and we have seen customers that want to start to sell and start with Zoom Phone first and that has been a great opportunity, it's a small percentage of our customers that are starting that way but it's a great opportunity for them if that's what they're interested in to get them in and get them used to Zoom and then expand over time in terms of understanding the full platform offering that we have. 54:36 So in terms of the progress that we're making, we continue to make progress there as we talked about earlier. devoting resources to international expansion and focus on this is still an opportunity, we are at still slightly under twenty percent of the global 2K that are spending more than one hundred thousand dollars a year with us, which just means that there's a huge opportunity ahead for us. 57:57 You are on mute. There we go. 58:38 Yeah. So, we will reiterate what we said earlier in the prepared remarks is that, we continue to see strong growth in the direct and the channel business. And that grew it twice the rate of the online business what we saw in Q3. And the online business will expect to be a headwind as we're still having these online customers which are the most volatile, many of them are still on monthly contracts. And as they are adjusting to the environment and figuring out how the future of work is going to be for them individually, We expect that to be the challenging headwind, then in Q4 you'll see a little bit of holiday seasonality as we talked about too. 60:09 Yeah. I mean, I can tell you that in terms of investing in areas like R&D and products specifically, we are still not even spending at the level we would like to be, our target for that is approximately ten percent so they still have a ways to go. They've come a long way in terms of hiring and investing there, but we still have more opportunity to expand both the products and the engineering team. And then sales as well, sales and marketing, we still see opportunity to continue add sales capacity on a global basis. The areas that were very, very thoughtful about adding additional investments and then wanting to do that in a very efficient way, of course, is COGS, we work very closely with Tommy and his team to make sure that we're adding capacity \u2013 we want to make sure that we have the right capacity for our customers, but doing that as efficiently as possible. And then, of course, G&A we want to do everything we can within our G&A functions to support our internal and external customers, but to do that also as efficient as we can. So that's kind of how we think about investing. So operating for grow still in R&D and sales, but trying to drive efficiency through COGS and G&A."

            "content": "01:48 Thank you Tom. In the spirit of the upcoming holiday season, I want to recognize the hard work of Zoom's global workforce and thank our customers, partners and investors for their steadfast trust and support. We continue to fortify our position as a leading brand in our industry. We are honored that Gartner named us a Leader in the twenty twenty one Magic Quadrant for Meeting Solutions for the sixth consecutive year and for Unified Communications as a Service for the second consecutive year. 02:28 Zoomtopia twenty twenty one was bigger and more successful than ever before. We hosted nearly thirty four thousand live virtual attendees on our platform and two seventy seven speakers, including customers like Choice Hotels, Ally, and Hubspot. And we did it on Zoom Events, our all-in-one solution for virtual and hybrid events. 02:56 Zoom Events allowed us to streamline event preparation, enhance audience engagement, and conduct better post-event communication and analysis. Its multitrack functionality enabled us to roll our Analyst Day directly into the Zoomtopia agenda so that participants could move seamlessly across the Analyst Day track, other tracks of Zoomtopia, and the all-connecting lobby. 03:29 At Zoomtopia, customers shared how they use Zoom to enable flexible co-located workforces and grow their businesses. We demonstrated how Zoom Apps, which already has sixty seven apps after only a few months, has the potential to enhance meeting productivity and collaboration. More and more businesses are building products on our platform that connect interrelated work streams to the Zoom client, both inside and outside the meeting. 04:03 We were also super excited to unveil the Zoom Video Engagement Center, which enhances our customers' ability to communicate with their customers through our omnichannel solution, and shows our broader commitment to the contact center space. It is expected to be generally available early next year. 04:28 Whether it's the ability to virtually whiteboard in and around the meeting, or utilize AI to transcribe or translate a meeting live, Zoomtopia demonstrated that previously futuristic capabilities have arrived. We are working hard to develop and deploy the technologies of the future to address current business needs and reimagine how we communicate and work in a flexible hybrid world. 04:59 Now let me recognize a few big wins for the quarter. We are excited to have Carrier Global Corp, the leading global provider of healthy, safe, sustainable and intelligent building and cold chain solutions, as a long standing Zoom Meetings customer and now, a new Zoom Phone customer as well. Following several months of extensive vendor reviews of leading UCaaS vendors, Carrier selected Zoom Phone to modernize their phone systems for a large portion of their nearly fifty three thousand employees across one eighty countries. We are so thankful that Carrier choses Zoom to deliver an increasingly comprehensive, secure, innovative and integrated set of communications services 05:56 In addition to Carrier, we had many other upsells this quarter. For example, one of the world's largest global retailers decided to add twenty thousand Zoom Phone licenses to their existing Meetings, Rooms, and Webinar footprint in order to better manage their global offices, distribution centers, and retail locations. This demonstrates our strong value add to the retail vertical and builds upon previous success stories like Tapestry and Target. 06:34 We also had several notable Zoom Meetings wins in Q3, including, a large expansion for a leading Federal System Integrator which puts them at forty five thousand users, demonstrating the security and reliability of our Zoom For Government Platform. A competitive win with a global technology firm for sixteen thousand five hundred meeting licenses to modernize the way their employees communicate, and expansion within our big four audit and big three consulting clients, which added more than thirty five thousand meetings licenses in the quarter to their existing strong meetings footprints. 07:25 Thanks to our customers, investors and the hard work of our approximately six thousand three hundred employees, we've grown over the past decade from a video conferencing solution to a communications platform that encompasses unified communications, as well as developer and event solutions. All these services provide an indispensable platform for individuals, enterprises and developers to connect, collaborate and build in the hybrid world. 8:00 And with that let me pass it over to Kelly. Yeah. Sterling. That's a great questions. As you see right in Q3 and a greater customer is like a carrier. And they expanded to deploy Zoom Phone and it's not a hundred and thousand, tens of a thousand deployment, right? So you look at the phone industry, right? I mean the clouds-based PBX industry, I think it's growing very well to replace legacy on-prem systems. Also, you look at those existing cloud-based phone providers, most of them develop a technologies stack many years ago. However, will those especially for large enterprise customers, when they migrate from on-prem to cloud, they do not want to deploy another solution, because the video and voice those two are converted into one service. In particular for those customers who already deployed Zoom Video platforms essentially technically Zoom Cloud's PBX system already there, we just need to enable and configure that. Otherwise, they are two fabulous solutions. That's why we have a high confidence that every time a lot of enterprise customers, they look at all those cloud-based phone solutions, Zoom always is the best choice. That's why I think the huge growth opportunity for our unified communication platform, video and voice together and to capture the wave of this cloud migration from on-prem to cloud. 20:47 Thank you. 21:15 Yeah. This is a good question. So we are very excited at Zoomtopia to announce our Zoom video engagement center. Because, the reason why we decided to invest resources on that is these are on our customers feedback. In terms of a gross trajectory, I would say it's very similar to what we did before for our Zoom Phone, right? We built a greater solution to leverage the same platform, and you can start up on existing customers, SME customers soon. Afterwards, you can roll it out to a lot of enterprise customers less our content center vision, right? Essentially, I think this market -- that contact center market is growing very well. However, a lot of enterprise customers, guess what, they still deployed on-premise solutions. For the next several years, I feel the opportunity is huge for us, right? Especially customers deployed Zoom Video and Phone together as an natural extension for our unified communication platform to help very significant and secure and the same platforms solution, which is our solution to the contact center space. 22:29 Well, by the way, we do have quite a few greater customers in the pipeline. 22:46 Yep. 28:43 Yes sure. So Matt, first of all when we started free user base is always like a marketing platform to promote of brand and give us a network effectiveness of our service platform. So that's how we introduced the pre service premium and forty minutes limitation. I think for now, given the brand recognition and given what had happened in last year, I think we got to take a step back to look at our free user online business. Right? And essentially on the one hand we would like to double down our enterprise market, of course, that business is growing extremely well. On the other hand, we got to be very accretive to look at how we lever our huge free user installer dates. Right, All over the work. Right? We started like the advertisement program for free users from international market and downloading a work and look at that as well because not only do we fix on the kind of conversion rate, front trade to pay it and that's not of a traditional model. Right? We got be creating the huge opportunity and two thing about how to modify that free user base differently. I think that's -- I think a team have put a lot of efforts on that and that's something we are very excited. 30:10 Thank you, Matt. 32:41 So just quickly to add on what Kelly side, Ryan. If out look at hybrid work, the conference room is extremely important. That's why you can the Zoom Rooms, right? It's uniquely positioned, it's much better than any other solution in order to support a hybrid world. Not only -- not to mention the Zoom Events also can support the new hybrid events, the service as well. Right? That's why you know huge opportunity for us to support a hybrid work in paradigm shift. 35:57 James. So, for now we're just focused on the pure free meetings. Right? Meaning that meaning halls, while we will have meeting all the free participant. Let's say, if you and I joined the meeting because we already paid the enterprise customer or predecessor, we will not show that this at. Right? It is more like a post -- post meeting attentive page, right? Because we do have, in some plants, but we want to start step by step gradually right. For now I'm sure that these free ads that are posted in the page from international market is purely for the frame meetings, and they try to do learn and, some express. And again, we got to be creative that's so many areas where we can be creative. Right? Because you got a data meeting participant, you in a of a number of for you, this is pretty healthy. Even for those best users, right? Maybe if it's not pay for our service anymore. They still use our service. Right? That's why the meaning is, Zoom still offers for good to while of. We got do think about how to monetize it differently. Again, this is something you pass, and we would like to explore more in the next few quarters. 37:13 Thank you. 37:58 Yeah. Rishi, that's a good question. First of all, I can tell you Zoom as a company, we're using our Chat for a long time and so many employees do enjoy that. And overall, this is a part of our overall platform vision because some customer I think do a good job to mission that and promote data because customer -- some customer even do not know that, right, before, But however, if we look at our chat usage, sorry, we did not publish that number yet, it's pretty healthy not only for SMB individual users, but also enterprise customer. They deployed both video and phone and also Zoom Chat is one platform. Right? And in terms of functionalities, scalability, I think we have a high confidence. On one hand, we do collaborate well with other chat solutions and we integrate very well, on the other hand for some customers they really want to deploy the solution for one vendor for video, voice and chat. We do have this flexibility. I think also our team, we are innovating as well. Right? I know adding more and more very cool functionalities right, as are announced at Zoomtopia. Again, this is something important for our overall UC platform, and we are going to invest more. 39:13 Thank you. 42:39 Shebly, that's a good question and unfortunately Rowan is not in the call. That's why, probably for both of us to answer this question. But anyway, we look at everything form a customer perspective. Even this field did not go through forever, and we still have many mutual customers and we have a great integration with Five9. And also, I think from that perspective everything is same as before. Right? But in terms of the deal, actually nobody knows that and let's see, we do not know, but also as I mentioned earlier, right and we have a full stack to support unified communication. Important, the customer deployed the Zoom Video already, they may do have deploy in Zoom Phone. We also asked about our strategy about our content center solution. And this reason why know we're are doubling down out video engagement center, which is our answer to the contact center solution. Anyway, I think this is where we are now, but I'm so sorry, it's really harder to know how to reengage or do the deal with Five9, because it will probably compliment. And again -- and for now, we are doubling down on our video engagement center and also working to together with all other contact center solution providers like Five9 a better integration, seamless express to our mutual customers. 44:07 Thank you. 44:41 Yes. Go ahead, Kelly. 46:04 Matt, again, actually, Five9 is still a great partner and Rowan and the team is great. They have a good -- they're friends, right? So we still working together right, you to talk the mutual customer. That's for sure. Regarding our gross strategy for consolidate UCaaS and CCaaS, first of all, I think we are doing very well on UCaaS. In terms of CCaaS the reason why we're announced the video engagement center, because of that, right? Because for some customer, they want to consolidate it together, and we do have an offering also how to accelerate our growth in addition to allocating our own resources to grow that business organically for sure, right, if there's any good, let's say, technology platform for next generation functionalities very accretive features, well we're open minded, right? 46:52 And Kelly has a big budget to support that effort. Again if you know of any other cool technology companies that can't help us for the beef up of investment on that front we're open minded. 47:12 Thank you. 47:44 That's a good question. So, first of all, I'd like to take a step back to share how we grow our platforms, it's not like some other cloud vendors, probably we targeted those traditional on prem solutions. Our Zoom Phone growth comes from not only for on-prem, the growth, also for other existing cloud-based phone solutions. They probably also see it with us, right? And we have both -- those customers coming from both side. And aside from that, for a lot of enterprise customers, in particular for our existing Zoom Video customers, we need look at the phone, this is very enterprise customer so very complex environment, probably they have multiple on premise solutions. They want to be very careful. They wanted to, you know, partner with a company with a vision, with reliability, security plus they also want to make sure video and voice those two can be converged and already test our service and realized and based on the criteria, Zoom is the only solution that can truly satisfy their needs. However, the process is pretty long, because again, enterprise phone deployment is very complex. And even with our existing customers, we want to be very careful. But after we go through the RFP process, Zoom is best positioned. Right? I think we see that very often over the past several quarters. I think that will be probably the pattern for the future, and growth as well. Because we have a high confidence as long as enterprise customers nobody saw complex they're existing on prem phone systems now, as long as the process embedded solutions. I think we have high confidence they are going to go with our solution. 49:31 Thank you. 49:54 So, Patrick, that's a good question. When it comes to conferencing it itself, I would say, it sounds very easy, but however it's really hard. Because it just works, right? And that's reason why our customer lack on platform. Even if some of the competitors try to add features, guess what? And you've got to make it work anytime any device. Take this earning call for example. How many of our competitors dare to host earning call on this platform. We're free, right? The reason why we have a confidence is not only only Zoom, but also some of our customers like my greater friend [indiscernible]. They also hosted earnings cast on Zoom platform because of very reliable greater video, audio quality, a lot of other -- video features like early next year we are going to announce other networks' functionality. And Patrick, you can show up as your digital avatar, right, if you want to, right? I think on the one hand, I think reliability, it works anywhere anytime and plus, always be the first window to come up with innovation. That's the reason why we are winning on that space. I think in the future, I would see more and more innovations and prices supported by development platform, the way you see platform also will keep us maybe leapfrog our competitors. Because again, as -- it's not like you have a fifty or one hundred percent UC, you can develop something similar. It's not like that, a huge investment to be on par with our platform. 51:29 It just works, it's just three words, It's not that -- it's pretty hard. 52:08 I think first of all, for very a large enterprise customers, in particular for those customers who deploy multiple, very complex on-premise, which is the sell cycle for Zoom Phone, right? It's not only just one on-prem to cloud, right? There's a lot of solutions, not to mention we need the support of the global participant, right? However, I think that Zoom solution is much better positioned, I think it normally a little longer time competed to Zoom meeting platform from deployed. I think we just need to focus on our product innovation and adopting our go to market and then actually more, more very complex enterprise deployment like carrier. They are going to migrate to Zoom platform. Again, I think it'll takes some time, interested enough, that some of our customers that even do not know Zoom Phone platform. Right. And however, after they know and test our platform, Zoom solution did much better than any other cloud solutions. You know, we have very, very high confidence. Because again, it is not a kind of thousands, those are ten of a thousand, very complex global footprint. it does demonstrate our Zoom Phone capability. 53:29 Thank you, Steve. 54:32 [Multiple Speaker] Yeah. You address the Global two thousand. Yeah. 55:02 So, Ittai, in terms of our competitive landscape. It's just purely look at video conferencing service. I think Zoom is a go to platform. And I think I really did not see any other vendors, even for the platform we mentioned IPOed before. I do not think that there is any competitor even, close to what we can offer. But in terms of the unified communication as a platform not only for meeting -- video conferencing but the meeting CCaaS. I think for now we have a huge opportunity if you look at our phone growth, right? And essentially, especially for our enterprise customs, they are not going to deploy multiple solutions for multiple vendors, very likely two vendors, right, probably for enterprise customers. It's a sort of a standard. 55:54 This zoom is very well positioned compared to any other -- the competitors. We do not see anything changed because, again, it's not like you can hold all features here and there. And underlying technology, right, that need many years' effort, right? And it's totally a different architecture, reliability and security, and also all those innovations. That's reason why I think Zoom is much better positioned. I really do not see any other competitor, and that's \u2013 coming in business space over the past two years. 56:32 Thank you. 56:56 Yeah. I saw that news last night, and I'm not still digesting that news. First of all, I would say, congratulations to Vonage and the team. And the hard work has very pretty paid off. And Ericsson is a great company. I think probably this is greater acquisition. And again, we are still digesting this news, but from our perspective, and I think our vision is very, very clear, right? We are focused on enterprise for use of stack, video, voice, CCaaS, events, Zoom Rooms through fully supportive hybrid work. Right? And Ericson is a great company and probably this will help us them solidify their position for 5G and also help for their cloud vision as well. And that's -- pretty much, what I think about it. 57:47 Thank you. 62:05 Matt, that's a great question. First of all, we like metaverse because our team already working on that for a while. The reason why our vision is to deliver a better video conference, even than a face to face in-person meeting. Right? And AR and DR is part of that. Our team already work on that. Right? You know, how to get it, that will probably take many years effort. For now this is very concept with a great story, right? And like a digital avatar, right? We demonstrated that functionality at Zoomtopia. Next year, we are going to have something like that I think there's more step-by-step to get there. Again we already are started it before, right? But we are not going to offer a hardware platform, we're going to partner with other vendors, like Facebook and any others, and we offer the software layer, because does fit very well to our vision. In the future with that AR or VR or metaverse, maybe the future metaverse. You and I can shake hands remotely. Seriously right? I talked about it three years ago, and we already adding resources before. That's why we're very excited, finally the word as our matter was. But guess what, we already started working on them for a while. Vision wise, it's very well. That's why we're very excited back into macro questions. Right where we are in the invest. We already invested that. We are just going to double down on that. Because, again, it fits very well to our company vision and a matter where we play a big it will follow-up future innovation. 63:36 Thank you. 63:43 Oh! Thank you all. Really appreciate you time, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all Zoom employees, all the customers, partners and investors. Wish you all have a wonderful holiday season. Thanks -- happiest Thanksgiving. Thank you all for your time, I'm so grateful. Thank you."

At this time, I'd like to hand it over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Matt. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Joining me today will be Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan; and Zoom\u2019s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.com. Also, on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2022, Zoom\u2019s expectations regarding financial and business trends; Zoom\u2019s growth strategy and business aspirations to drive evolution on multiple fronts as organizations and people reimagine work, communications and collaboration; and Zoom being well-positioned to be successful as a platform. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today\u2019s webinar. In addition, as you all know, we announced our intent to acquire Five9 in July. Clearly, we are excited about joining forces with Five9, but please note that we will not be discussing or addressing questions regarding the pending transaction at this time as we are in the process of regulatory review. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, and welcome to everyone joining us on today\u2019s Webinar. I want to start by thanking our customers and partners for their trust and loyalty, which led to our continued strong revenue growth alongside remarkable profitability and free cash flow. We also want to thank our hard working employees for their dedication to delivering happiness to our customers and partners. I have been humbled by the stories of how finance professionals have leveraged Zoom to reimagine the way they work. Specifically, I\u2019d like to thank Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway for his remarks about how Zoom has added so much convenience to his life. We are so delighted to count Charlie as a happy user. And I nominate myself to be Charlie\u2019s personal Zoom tech support if he ever needs it. In Q2, we also achieved several milestones, setting the foundation for us to thrive as a platform. In July, we launched Zoom Apps, which brings over 50 apps right into the Zoom meeting experience. And this is just the beginning. The beauty of our platform is it allows our ecosystem of developers to add even more functionality, by building apps where workflows are integrated with meeting interactions. This is a win-win because better integrations will boost our customer\u2019s productivity and afford our developers exposure to our large user base. The Zoom Apps Fund, which has already invested in over a dozen startups in our Zoom Apps and SDK ecosystem, further aligns us with developers, enabling them to focus more on innovation. We are also excited to have launched Zoom Events in July. Zoom Events is an easy, yet powerful solution to produce and host company and public events. It acts as a layer above our existing Zoom Video Webinars and Zoom Meetings products. Zoomtopia will be virtual on Zoom Events in only two weeks and we hope to see all of you there. In Q2, we saw several large customer upsells. We were happy to expand with a leading tech firm who increased their Meetings licenses over sixfold to 95,000, and with a global financial services customer who added over 63,000 Zoom Phone licenses, making them our new largest customer. Both wins were displacements of legacy solutions that Zoom beat in terms of reliability, simplicity and integration. And let me recognize a few big wins for the quarter: I want to welcome NEC Corporation to the Zoom family. Based out of Japan, NEC is a leader in the integration of IT and network technologies behind their slogan: \u201cOrchestrating a brighter world\u201d. In order to enhance the productivity, collaboration and happiness of their global workforce, NEC deployed approximately 110,000 Zoom Meetings licenses. I also want to welcome Seagate Technology to the Zoom family. Seagate is a global mass-data storage infrastructure leader innovating world-class, precision-engineered data storage and management solutions with a focus on sustainable partnerships. Seagate recently decided to modernize and integrate their global communications infrastructure with over 14,000 Zoom Meetings licenses and over 17,000 Zoom Phone licenses. Next is a Zoom Phone upsell. In Q2 of last year, we welcomed ExxonMobil, which develops and applies next-generation technologies to help safely and responsibly meet the world's growing needs for energy and chemical products, to the Zoom family. They began as a Zoom Video conferencing customer to enable their teams to collaborate globally. We are grateful to have seen our partnership evolve over the past year and excited that ExxonMobil has recently decided to add Zoom Phone to further enhance the user experience for their global workforce leveraging a communications platform that is easy to deploy and manage. In addition to these great customer wins, we also closed another strategic channel partnership with Telkomsel, the largest cellular operator in Indonesia, which is the world\u2019s fourth largest country by population. Telkomsel understands and wants to support their 170 million subscribers\u2019 need for seamless and reliable virtual meetings to thrive in the digital workplace era. They will be leveraging the power of Zoom\u2019s Developer Platform and ISV Partner Program to deliver a fully integrated solution via their CloudX offering for the Enterprise segment and Zoom native apps for the Consumer segment. The collaboration between Telkomsel and Zoom will bring communication to the next level by combining Zoom\u2019s strong capabilities and feature-rich platform with Telkomsel\u2019s best quality network and localized interface, together creating a powerful tool to improve customer productivity and collaboration. Thank you NEC, Seagate, ExxonMobil, and Telkomsel. I love you all. Enterprises want digital platforms that combine meetings, phone, events, office technology, and developer solutions in a way that is simple, reliable, and frictionless. This fundamental truth underpins our leadership position in video conferencing, and will help to drive further growth in Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms, as we expand our platform and addressable market in the hybrid world. Today we are fortunate to be a leading global brand with over half a million customers having more than 10 employees. Our internal innovation engine is strong, and bolstered by our growing Zoom Apps developer ecosystem and acquisitions such as Kites, that will strengthen our position in AI transcription and translation. As organizations and people reimagine work, communications and collaboration, we are faced with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to drive this evolution on multiple fronts. Thanks again to the hard work of our over 5,700 employees and the trust of our loyal customers, we are positioned well to be successful as a platform embracing and enabling hybrid work. I\u2019m very excited about the future, the journey has only begun. And with that let me pass it over to Kelly.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric. And hello everyone. We had an eventful Q2, with several highlights - the first of which was the strength in the enterprise. We were able to grow the number of enterprise customers spending more than $1 million dollars in ARR by 77% year over year. And the second highlight is the acceleration we have seen with Zoom Phone. We grew the number of customers spending more than $100,000 dollars in ARR on Zoom Phone by 241% year over year. In August, we will reach 2 million Zoom Phone seats sold, only 8 months after reaching our first million; We added 8 Zoom Phone customers with more than 10,000 seats in the first half of FY22, bringing us to a total of 26; And in Q2 we broke our record for the largest Zoom Phone deal to date twice in the same day. It is important to note that as we\u2019ve just lapped our first full quarter year-over-year compare since the start of the pandemic, we have seen customers return to more thoughtful, measured buying-patterns. While revenue, profitability, and cash flow were strong in the second quarter and the first half, other metrics have begun to normalize, especially when compared to the unprecedented year-over-year comps. In Q2, total revenue grew 54% year over year to $1.02 billion dollars, marking our first billion dollar plus quarter - only five quarters after reaching a billion dollar annual run rate. The top-line result exceeded the high end of our guidance of $990 million dollars. We saw strength in our direct and channel businesses, which grew at twice the rate of our online business. Zoom Phone, Zoom Rooms and Asia Pacific growth also accelerated in the quarter. The year-over-year growth in revenue for the quarter was driven by a healthy mix between new and existing customers, where new customers accounted for approximately 74% of the incremental revenue, and existing customers accounted for 26% of the incremental revenue. Let\u2019s take a look at the key customer metrics for the quarter: We saw 131% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 2,278 customers generating more than $100,000 dollars in trailing twelve months revenue. We exited the quarter with approximately 504,900 customers with more than 10 employees, up 36% year over year and representing 64% of revenue. In Q2, customers with 10 or fewer employees represented approximately 36% of revenue, in line with Q2 last year, but down from its high of 38% in Q3 of last year. As we discussed previously, this cohort, which comprises SMBs and consumers who typically purchase online, is more volatile and we expect it to continue to decline as a percentage of revenue as customers adjust to the evolving environment. Our Net Dollar Expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees exceeded 130% for the 13th consecutive quarter as existing customers increased their spend with Zoom and upsells of Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms picked up pace. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Our Americas revenue grew 50% year over year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew 62% year over year to be approximately 33% of revenue, up from 31% a year ago. In recent quarters, we have made significant investments in our international teams. In Asia Pacific, our direct sales team drove several strong wins in the enterprise segment. However, in EMEA, we saw some headwinds, which were predominantly driven by declines in the online segment. Now turning to profitability, which was strong from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation expenses and gains or losses on strategic investments. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 76.2%, compared to 72.3% in Q2 last year and 73.9% in Q1 of this year. The sequential improvement in gross margin is mainly due to new data center capacity coming online, and lower usage during the summer months, particularly with schools. We now expect gross margin outlook to be higher than previously discussed at approximately 75% for the remainder of the fiscal year while we continue to support free K-12 education. Research and development expense grew by 89% year over year to approximately $54 million dollars. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense was approximately 5.3%, an increase from Q2 of last year, demonstrating our commitment to building out our engineering teams globally and maintaining best-in-class product and innovation. Sales and marketing expense grew by 72% year over year to $211 million dollars. Sales and marketing expense was approximately 20.7% of total revenue, an increase from Q2 of last year, mainly due to investments and hiring to drive sustainable future growth. We plan to increase investment in global sales capacity, as well as digital marketing and events to drive additional leads for our sales team across Meetings, Phone, Rooms and Events. G&A expense in the quarter grew by 73% to $89 million dollars, as we continued to scale these functions and invest in systems, automation and compliance to meet our new scale. G&A expense was approximately 8.7% of total revenue, a slight increase from Q2 of last year. The revenue upside in the quarter carried through to the bottom line, with non-GAAP operating income of $425 million dollars, exceeding our guidance. This translates to a 41.6% non-GAAP operating margin for Q2, steady with both Q2 last year and Q1 this year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.36, on approximately 306 million non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding. This result is 21 cents above the high end of our guidance and 44 cents above Q2 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.2 billion dollars, up 59% year over year from $743 million dollars. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $2.3 billion dollars, up 66% year over year from $1.4 billion dollars. We expect to recognize approximately 69% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 72% in Q2 of last year, reflecting a shift back to longer term plans. It is important to remember that because over 40% of our business is billed monthly and typically bought online, deferred revenue and RPO trends are not reliable predictors of future revenue growth. As I mentioned last quarter, the timing of our renewals has increasingly shifted to the beginning of the fiscal year, with Q1 now representing our largest renewal quarter. This shift in seasonality is a result of the significant growth we experienced in the first half of FY21. We expect this front-weighted seasonality will persist and potentially become even more pronounced given the scale of our base and practice of upselling coterminously with existing contracts. As such, we would expect total deferred revenue and RPO to be down modestly from Q2 to Q3. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.1 billion dollars in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had strong operating cash flow in the quarter of $468 million dollars, up from $401 million dollars in Q2 last year. Free cash flow was $455 million dollars, up from $373 million dollars in Q2 last year. The increase is primarily attributable to the top-line growth and disciplined spending. Looking at the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to increase our capital expenditures related to ongoing data center expansion to support our growth outlook. Now, turning to guidance. Please note that the ever-changing nature of the global pandemic continues to impact our segments and regions in different ways. Our outlook is based on our current assessment of the business environment. Specifically, our outlook assumes that our direct and channel business will continue to experience robust growth, while our online business will be a headwind in the coming quarters as smaller customers and consumers adjust to the evolving environment. For the third quarter of FY22, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.015 to $1.02 billion dollars. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $340 to $345 million dollars. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.07 to $1.08 based on approximately 309 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY22, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.005 to $4.015 billion dollars, which would represent approximately 51% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $1.5 to $1.51 billion dollars which would represent approximately 53% to 54% year-over-year growth. Our outlook for the non-GAAP earnings per share is $4.75 to $4.79, based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. Before concluding, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to join us in two weeks at Zoomtopia, our two-day immersive experience that is packed with exciting product updates, guest speakers and virtual networking opportunities. And on day one of Zoomtopia, please join us for our Financial Analyst Briefing, where we will be providing you with greater detail on Zoom Phone, the platform, our channel partnerships and much more. As always, Zoom is grateful to be a driving force enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless and secure communications platform. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue-up our first question.\nOperator: Our first question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer.\nIttai Kidron: Hey, guys, thanks. Now don\u2019t forget to unmute yourself. Great quarter again, guys. Kelly, I want to focus kind of on this position, clearly, you are doing extremely well with Phones is phenomenal, the growth that you're seeing over there.  But can you give me a little bit more insights as to what is the growth in meetings right here right now, my math suggests a very significant deceleration in your expansion rate? And I would suspect that that's tied specifically to meetings decelerating. Help me think about the contribution of growth of those two elements and perhaps how would that change over the next 12 months?\nKelly Steckelberg: So, I think in terms of the expansion that you're talking about the implied expansion rate that you calculated\u2026\nIttai Kidron: Yes.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. And I just wanted to remind you first of all, that when you calculate that, it includes all of our customer bases. And as we mentioned, we are seeing headwinds in the online segment of our business for sure.  So that's -- I would say that while we don't break out revenue, we see strength -- continued strength in the up-market enterprise in both meetings and phones, and where you're seeing that challenge in the implied metric is really coming from the online segment of our business.\nIttai Kidron: So, is it right to interpret that to me that churn is now finally rising in that category. Is that the right way to think about this going forward now that the economy is slowly opening some businesses, I guess, scaling back on the usage here?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So remember, the online business is primarily, not exclusively, but primarily small business and individual. And I think what we've seen is while the future of Delta is still unknown, we do see individuals especially moving around the world and feeling comfortable.  I think we were talking about most of us are probably socializing in person now, doing fewer things like Zoom Happy Hours, and that's where we are starting to see some of the challenges. So the net dollar expansion in the online segment is what\u2019s driving - pulling that number down a little bit.\nIttai Kidron: Got it. Very good. Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yep.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Enders with KeyBanc.\nSteve Enders: Okay, great. Thanks for taking my question here. I guess I just want to dig in a little bit more on kind of the trends you're seeing in the second half. It looks like you're now guiding down a little bit. It was a downtrend or think before we're talking about an uptrend. So just want to get a better sense for what\u2019s the biggest incremental change that you're seeing there on the Analog and what changed in the past three months specifically?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, again, we continue to see strength in our upmarket. We're excited about what we're seeing in the enterprise, in Zoom Phone, in international -- and international, we all saw growth accelerate in Q2. When we look out though what we have seen is a slowdown in the online segment of the business, which again, even though the pandemic seems to be far from over, we are happy that people are feeling more comfortably out traveling, and that's really where we're seeing the slowdown. And if you back all the way up to when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we had expected that towards the end of the year, but it's just happened a little bit more quickly than we expected. And I mean, of course, we feel good that people are out moving around the world, but it's certainly creating some headwinds, as we've said, in the online segment of our business.\nSteve Enders: Okay, great. And is that creating any opportunities then as companies getting by going back to the office for Zoom Rooms and incremental activity with that product?\nKelly Steckelberg: Absolutely. So, we saw Zoom Rooms start to accelerate again in Q2, which is very exciting as our customers are planning and thinking about the attach rates more than doubled quarter-over-quarter from Q1 to Q2. So absolutely, companies are preparing and planning for welcoming their employees back to the office.\nSteve Enders: Okay, perfect. Thanks for taking my questions.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Thank you, Steve.\nOperator: Our next question is from Taz Koujalgi with Guggenheim. Hey, Taz, you're on mute.\nTaz Koujalgi: Can you guys hear me now?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nTaz Koujalgi: Sorry about that. Hi, I have a question about Zoom Phone. So if you look at the numbers you reported tonight, you add about 500 million seats, I think in the last four months. Prior to that, you are adding about 500 million seats \u2013 500,000 seats every quarter. It looks like a bit of a slowdown in the number of seats you're adding this quarter. Is that a fair comment?\nKelly Steckelberg: It\u2019s almost exactly the same timeframe because I think we had announced in December that we hit a million, and then we announced 1.5 million on our call in April and then 2 million on this call. So, it's almost exactly at the same pace.\nTaz Koujalgi: Got it. And then just one follow-up, you said weakness in the online segment, is that coming from just increased churn? Or are you seeing a slowdown in the \u2013 in new customer acquisition in that line item?\nKelly Steckelberg: It's a little bit of both. So as we mentioned, we specifically saw some challenges in certain regions like EMEA, where the world, at least for a period of time, was a little more open again, and people are moving around. And that's where we see people taking advantage of being out in the world and seeing some slower top line bookings, as well as accelerated churn.\nTaz Koujalgi: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great, thanks. Kelly, I just wanted to dig into your kind of commentary on more measured spending patterns that you're seeing and taking away from kind of the smaller business commentary that you've been giving and focusing that on the enterprise.  And so just trying to get a sense. Does that mean, normalizing the amount of seats that they're adding or that they are rationalizing kind of the seats that they've had, that they're rationalizing a number of video solutions that they're having in-house? Just what does that kind of commentary around, more measured patterns around the enterprise business mean? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Thank you, Meta. We saw this start a little bit in Q1 and now continue into Q2, where I think it's not necessarily measured in terms of how much they're buying, but more measured and thoughtful in how they are buying in that they want to take their time.  They're doing more complete like proof-of-concepts, for example, versus if you think about a year ago, they were in this sort of stage of trying to keep the lights on almost and buying very quickly and now they're taking the time to really be thoughtful.  And it's just \u2013 it\u2019s back to kind of the way they used to buy pre-pandemic, which is just a much more normal buying patterns. So, I think that we're back to more normal. And for the four quarters, I guess, we saw last year was really the blip and now we're back to a more normal measured approach the customers are facing.\nMeta Marshall: And as part of that, just because there\u2019s a couple of a decision by Phone now, or just anything having to do with that?\nKelly Steckelberg: I think that certainly, the Phone is a different buying cycle, but usually by the time they get to Phone they already know Zoom. So, it's not that, that is necessarily slowing it down and just that they're taking their time to think about these decisions that they're making.\nMeta Marshall: Okay, great. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. I guess on the continued success on Zoom Phone here, called out a number of very large deals. Curious on how often you're being brought in where they're also contemplating a contact center upgrade? Where have you stood?  Obviously, the partnership with Five9 has been in place for a while. But just more generally speaking, how often is upgrading to Zoom Phone a part of a broader modernization across that could potentially include contact center?\nKelly Steckelberg: Well, hi, Matt. I actually don't know exactly off the top of my head the specifics around that. We obviously are having an integrated phone and contact center solution is really important to many companies, which is why we're excited about the deal that we're working on with Five9.  And as you say, we've been partnering with them. We also have other partnerships in place as well. And so, there's nothing different about that, that has changed. I have to go back and look. I don't know exactly what the typical cap rates are between those two, though. Eric, if you have \u2013 do you have a perspective on that?\nEric Yuan: Yes, sure. So, Matt, if you look at our installed base, right, by now I think they really wanted to migrate from on-prem PBX system to the cloud, right? That\u2019s where the huge opportunities that comes from. Also, since the pandemic, I think that we do see some of the enterprise customers.  They also started asking about, \"Hey, what's your cloud contact center strategy because they started at planning now, right? That's why we think this is kind of the new opportunity for us, not only for the brand and new revenue stream for contact center, but also it might have - further grow our Phone business as well. Because like about a year ago, right, where a few large invest customers they really wanted to migrate on-prem contact center to us.  Now, given the digital transformation for almost every enterprise customers, we do see more and more customers that are very interested. That\u2019s why timing-wise, it's perfect for us to double down on the progress the contact center grows.\nMatthew VanVliet: Great. And then following up quickly on the education front, schools get back into session, whether or not they're going to be in person or not is sort of a debate here. But I guess, what's the I guess potential of monetizing more of that installed base? Is it still going to be a relatively free solution? Or how is that strategy evolve? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: So, Matt, before I answer to that questions, as you know, our company values care. The number one we\u2019re seeing is really about our community, right? For us to support K-12 schools, this \u2013 I would say that\u2019s a no-brainer for us to support that at no cost, right? We feel very proud.  We never thought about how to monetize our service for those K-12 schools, right? Now they all go back to the school, right? With that, we\u2019re having more resources to think about how to monetize other installed bases.  I give an example, like free users. Last year, we were extremely busy to have the world - to have people stay connected. We even did not have banners to think about how to monetize those free users, right, I mean, how to embrace with the consumer, right? We never thought about that before. Now it's the right time, right? How to think about embracing the consumer's credit. How to monetize those free users. It's something we're very excited. We do not want to monetize those K-12 schools. It\u2019s our responsibility to have with us as always.\nMatthew VanVliet: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pat Walravens with JMP Securities.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. Thank you. Hi, guys. I mean, I don't think there's ever been a company that has grown so fast and realistically pulled a lot of demand forward, right? Because everyone needed to get their video conferencing solutions in place very quickly. And now, as I look at 54% this quarter, Kelly, your guidance suggests 30%, 31% in Q3 and 15% in Q4.  So, all that is just a lead-up for Eric. What is your top one or two priorities in the next 12 months as you go from this hyper growth to a much more reasonable growth period? If you could just sort of contrast those for us, I think that would be really helpful.\nEric Yuan: Sure. I would say, Patrick, that\u2019s a great question. First of all, you look at it prior to the pandemic, look at our growth, always focused on the enterprise customers, right? We\u2019re the first service videoconferencing. We introduced a second revenue stream, Zoom Phone, both of them are doing well and how to introduce the third one or fourth one.  How to double down on that? But there's always our thought, right? If \u2013 we did not realize this is due to pandemic crisis, otherwise several years ago, probably, we should have planned sort of hospice services beforehand.  Now, actually, now this indeed can get our strategy, right, how to introduce more and more revenue stream, new services to support our enterprise customer. That's always part of us. Essentially, this is a part of our overall platform strategy, right? I mean, aside from that, also, there's a new opportunity ahead of us. As I mentioned earlier, right, we never realized there are so many consumers, right, and who are so loyal to our - the platform, right? The usage is still pretty healthy, how to embrace the consumer's credit is also something on top of our minds as well, right? We never thought about that before. it's the right time. For those two things, enterprise platform and also consumer, those two things will drive our future growth.\nPatrick Walravens: That's great. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Patrick.\nOperator: Our next question is from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yes. So thank you very much. So, I look at your implied guide for Q4. It seems like you're guiding it to decel to around 12% or so, plus or minus from 30% or so in Q3 with a similar compare I would argue. Now, it seems like it'll actually be down potentially sequentially from Q3.  So, can you elaborate on why that might be the case? You talked about online issues. How long do they last, for example? And if we go to like 10% to 12% growth in Q4, should we accelerate afterward if we -- the compares get easier, how should we think about next year?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, in terms of what you're seeing in Q4, it is continued uncertainty around headwinds in the online segment, absolutely, it\u2019s driving that. And we're -- in terms of what that implies for next year, we're not ready to give FY'23 guidance today, unfortunately. So we will be prepared to do that when we get on the Q4 earnings call and, of course, we'll have a lot more earnings at that point to share with you, but that is what - exactly what continues to drive that in Q4.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay. Is there any reason why the online issues would be bigger in EMEA than in the Americas, in Asia?\nKelly Steckelberg: Well, that is like the pandemic question, right? Because it really what we've seen is this varies depending by region and by segment depending on where each of those countries or markets is in their pandemic lifecycle. And we've seen it ebb and flow over the last 18 months by market. And so that's the challenge even I think that all businesses are having right now. And thinking about the future with uncertainty - so much uncertainty around the pandemic right now, it's just difficult to forecast exactly.\nEric Yuan: Yes. To add on to what Kelly said, our user base in EMEA, seasonality also is a factor, right? In particular, in the summertime, not to mention that COVID situation and the user there might have a little bit longer vacation, right? It's seasonality for sure is the key factor, and that's another big difference compared to our user base here.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ryan Koontz with Needham.\nRyan Koontz: Hi. Thanks for the question. Great to hear the progress in the enterprise. Clicking along there and it sounds like some real strength in APAC. Why don't you share with us any additional color on particular market verticals or applications you're seeing that are kind of key to penetrating and getting these big, large global 2,000 tech wins. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Ryan, I would say, first of all, with our top two market is not education and healthcare is pretty strong and also will bring us more opportunities when we expand it into the international market like APAC. And also, like those telco, Telkomsel, right? Those kind of a telco partnership will further help us for us to penetrate into each of those APAC countries, right, and to most of the new opportunities.  Recently, we launched Zoom Apps. And also, like some of the partners, they build new solution upon our platform, like fast technologies, right? I think a lot of new opportunities, right, we do not need to go build up by ourselves, right?  And those sort of party customers, they can leverage our either API or SDK, or Zoom App to build all kinds of new the solutions to focus on all those vertical markets, or even at the department as well, right? That's where the opportunities are coming from.\nRyan Koontz: So, you're seeing some opportunities to upsell into the Cfast-type applications in the enterprise?\nEric Yuan: Yeah, both, actually. Yes, because in those third-party partners, a little bit of very healthy business also bringing the Zoom to the installed base and also by establishing a trust, right? We also obviously are in most stock, right? Essentially, it\u2019s a very healthy channel, not only for their own business and whatever, but also it's a greater channel for us.\nRyan Koontz: Helpful. Thanks, Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Ryan.\nOperator: The next question is from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to dig into the enterprise segment. Q1, Q2, those are two big renewal quarters now that's behind now. So what sort of changes you are doing on your go-to-market strategy, mainly increasing quoto carrying sales save, or any changes that you are doing for this normalized environment?  And Phone used to be one of the big cross-sell opportunities for you, and how should we think about the Phone as you get into a more normalized renewal environment?\nKelly Steckelberg: We are absolutely continuing to invest in our sales capacity. We are focused on certain regions, especially where we see lots of opportunities like Asia-Pac. We recently hired a new leader there, and are really excited about the progress we're already seeing with his leadership.  And then we are continuing to invest in marketing. So as we've moved post-pandemic era a little bit in terms of not hoping that, but sort of what we saw from last year with the lift in brand awareness, we're continuing now to think about how do we invest more in specific product marketing around Zoom Phone, around Zoom Rooms as well as digital marketing campaign. So, helping the community drive additional leads for all of our teams on a global basis.  And then also the channel has continued to be a really important aspect of our go-to-market. So the channel was responsible for approximately 27% of our Zoom Phone sales in Q2. We added six additional master agents, partners during Q2. So really excited about continuing to invest in the channel on a global basis.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks, Kelly.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. So I think I'm going to -- I'll probably touch on a topic that's been mentioned here before. Because I think a lot of people that are investing in the Company at this point, they really are investing in the non-online story of the Company, right, the enterprise story, the large business. There's a lot of metrics there.  There's a lot of kind of pollution and noise in these metrics. How do we think about the growth of the important part of the business for investors, meaning the over 10 employee-customer bases, either from an incremental bookings perspective, from an incremental revenue perspective?  And when does the headwind or anchor on the business from the pandemic, from the once in a generation SMB buying pattern. When does that trough? And so, when do we see a normalized kind of normalized growth rate for the Company?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So thank you, Alex. First of all, we agree with you that really, we want everyone focused on the long-term potential of the up-market. As a reminder, in Q2, that segment of the business grew at twice the rate of the online business. So that gives you some indication of how those two segments are diverging a little bit.  And then as we look forward, I guess the best way to help you think about it is you want to look at the net dollar, the implied net dollar expansion rate that we were talking about earlier, right? You can think about what's happening there is the net dollar expansion rate for the online segment is under one, right? That gives you some idea of what's happening, again, how to think about those two different segments of our business. In terms of where is, is there a trough? I think that it's back to kind of trying to predict the pandemic, which is a difficult thing for obviously anybody in the world to do right now. And as much as we are excited about vaccines being more widely distributed, unfortunately, as we see delta continuing to grow in certain parts of the world, we have even in the last few weeks, like seeing certain pockets of strength. So, I think that that's going to depend on really what we continue to see in terms of the spread of variants around the world.\nAlex Zukin: Got it. And I guess maybe for Eric, you mentioned the seasonality, the vacations in Europe. Is there a way to kind of get a sense for the delta upon about just EMEA SMB versus the U.S. SMB just so we can get some sense of that magnitude change?\nEric Yuan: I think overall, I think our up-market are doing, especially look at in North America [being in a swipe] [ph] In EMEA, I think the mass-market online SMB I think it did not do well last quarter. Seasonality, COVID situation, for sure, made things a little bit worse because they're longer vacation [Indiscernible]. Here, look at our North America market, I think, the upsell Phone and also the Zoom Rooms because every Company, I think, they're starting to go back to the office. The new opportunities are coming. They're also doing very well. That's why I say even if a little bit of challenge on SMB, by and large, we did not see the big profit. And because offset by the hybrid of work opportunities, right? I think if you look at APAC. APAC, we did not see that at all, right, in the last quarter, it\u2019s still doing very well. I think overall, we - as you mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve got to go back to our enterprise. Because the last year, I think the online business used to be just a marketing channel, right? But, however, not only marketing channel, but also contribute a lot to our revenue from a percentage perspective.  Now, it came with that, that percentage is going down for online. In a balance, it\u2019s very healthy for our rates, right? With that, we can focus on our core enterprise customer. And plus, given that, we've become a household name, it will bring a new opportunity to monetize, used to be the monetization for online loan and users, just the online subscription.  I would say that may not be the sustainable strategy, right, to further online users\u2019 monetization. We\u2019ve got to have other ways, right, monetize those online \u2013 the installed base. That's why we are very excited about our future.\nAlex Zukin: Thank you, guys.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Our next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hey, guys, thanks for the question. On the win with Seagate as an example here, how often are you seeing it that phone is leading to a greater number of seats at existing customers, or really, how can we think about that potential uplift within just to install base today, are selling a phone with meetings that create a greater number of seats at current accounts, not just meetings seats, but overall, employees, they can actually cell phone into?  There's the two times opportunity that we just don't have as many meetings seats because you can have more -- you can have fewer hosts than you do employees.\nEric Yuan: James, that's a great observation. You are so right. I think one year ago we really did not see that. Normally we buy more licenses and as Bob probably alluded to our sales, and also for the existing installer base, the upsell of Phones.  For the brand-new customers, because of the cost of looking at one platform on both video and voice, we understand video and voice are converging into one platform, plus in our Zoom [Indiscernible] is very mature now, every quarter being very well [Indiscernible], it is not like this is something brand new.  They do not want to take any risk. Is very mature, plus the integrated screen, both video and [Indiscernible], Essentially, from now, I would say probably I don't know, but I guess probably more and more customers who view is going to deploy video for us and it didn't deploy. Today on the last biggest both given the dynamics of each business, sometimes probably they wanted to deploy more Zoom seats than the [Indiscernible].\nJames Fish: Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, James.\nOperator: The next question is from Will Power with Baird.\nWill Power: Great. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Check the question probably for you Kelly. As we think about the 10 plus employee cohort, your upmarket segment, how do we think about one, customer growth from here?  And two, as you think about that net expansion, they've been above a 130%. What's the sustainability of that, right? Because you've gotten a number of growth drivers and you've got the law of large numbers working against you. How do we think about the outlook on that front?\nKelly Steckelberg: In terms of net dollar expansion, we expect it to stay above 30 certainly for Q3. And then in terms of Q4, we expected to be in at least in that range, not is a quarter out. We don't know exactly, but we are going to be right in that same range still for Q4.  And then in terms of the customer growth, I think that what you are going to continue to see is ongoing growth driven by large deals. So, the customer count may slow, but as you're going to continue to see growth driven by these big deals, as we see opportunities to continue to cross-sell with Zoom Phone, as you heard, right?  We beat our two largest deals records on the same day this quarter. So really seeing opportunities there. And then as we were planning to go back to the office, also opportunities for Zoom Rooms.  And then think about doing an event. We're going to start to see opportunities for larger and larger, bigger customer wins. And I think the other thing to note, we talk about in the quarter, but just want to make sure we understand.  We had a deal this quarter that now became our new largest customer. So that's our new customer, an existing now with their up-sale right to begin the largest customer so we're continuing to see these really significant large bins. And that I expect to continue.\nWill Power: Right, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, thanks for taking the question. You talked a little bit about some more measured behavior from customers in terms of buying patterns. I'm just wondering, can you talk a little bit about the competitive backdrop, whether you've seen peers, maybe getting more aggressive, especially larger enterprise customers, really take their time to reevaluate the future of work Post COVID. Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Eric, you want to talk about --\nEric Yuan: Sure. I think we look at it, the churn, the future work, hybrid work for short that will be the mainstream, right? And however, and because of the cost of embracing hybrid work, a lot of employees like a student working from a home, or maybe work the remitted locations, and another [Indiscernible], the prior to pandemic crisis quite often, and you might have deployed loosen.  This is good enough, right? And giving employees now to support the hybrid work, the best way to service will do very well. Look at our employees, they do not have, I just part, you know, sitting next to them, right? And approximately you need to worry the productivity if you do not give the best for tools.  That's why in the good enough services, we're not doing well. Every business we would like to deploy the best-of-breed service. But always give the employees much better tools to improve their productivity, to help employees because to support a hybrid world is not that straightforward, right? I'll give you one example, like a complement solution, we're producing [Indiscernible] feature.  All of which, customers, they do not care to have a meeting by somebody assisting in the conference room, some join remotely, that experience is not as good as the big, the webinar on me too right. That's why I think the hybrid work, certainly we'll have Zoom by even some of sometimes our competitors the mile of evidence of price.  I think the good news is the customer really wants to have a very reliable fixing us the platform, you know very easy to use. I think that's the reason why I think that Zoom is positioned much better than any of our competitors.\nMatthew Niknam: Thanks, Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question is from Boyoung Kim with Citi.\nBoyoung Kim: Hi, Tyler Radke, earlier in the Q and A, you showed some progress around the master agent program and also had cited some really large international phone deals. So, I wanted to hear about what you're seeing in terms of the productivity of the channel partners and international markets relative to what you're seeing from channel partners in the U.S. and to what extent is that impacted by the nascent stage of the master agent program in international markets, as well as the nascent state of the broader market in a cloud-based phone. Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, I think we are seeing strength in our channel partners globally. But as you say, it's a much newer program and much smaller internationally. So excited to really -- this is one of the main focuses for our channel team, which is expanding outside of the U.S., it's focused for the rest of the year.  In terms of productivity, I don't think that it really varies. I mean we were really excited about the Telkomsel deal, which is one of our largest channel partner deals, ISP deals with date, so that's really exciting. But we've had significant wins in the U.S. as well. So not seeing dramatic differences in productivity on a global basis.\nOperator: Our next question is going to be from Matt Stotler with William Blair.\nMatt Stotler: Hey guys, thanks for taking the question. I think just -- just one for me. Obviously, as you guys have spoken to so far, the enterprise opportunity here is really kind of the which was really exciting and compelling going forward.  But given the commentary around finding other ways to monetize the base, whether that's a consumer or otherwise, we'd love to maybe get an update, or whatever color you can provide on the level of premium usage that you're seeing today, now outside of the seasonality with education, Just the level of premium users from the platform, how that's changed over the past 4 or 5 quarters, thoughts on the back half there, and then any commentary on what conversion you've seen there or you expect you could see if you decided to really try and monetize that.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nEric Yuan: Go ahead.\nKelly Steckelberg: We still see free users. A large, they've really grown over the last 18 months and they're about 30% of our minute usage today as compared to like 10% pre-pandemic. That gives you an idea of the number -- we don't talk about the number of users, but that at least gives you a relative understanding of how they grow over time.  And like we always say, as Eric mentioned about our share value of care, our core value of care we really care about all those [Indiscernible] specially to keep people connected during these more difficult times. And there's always a hope that they continue to invert or that they have the opportunity to give you a new [Indiscernible] more new users to the power of Zoom.\nMatt Stotler: Got it, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chaim Siegel with Elazar Advisors.\nChaim Siegel: Hi, Kelly and Eric. How are you?\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi. Nice to see you.\nChaim Siegel: I had a couple of questions if you have time, but since obviously, the focus is on enterprise, I just wanted to know how fast the sales forces growing and when the efficiency for that Salesforce starts to kick in. I guess that's one.  And also, just related to that on operating expenses. So, I'm not sure how long you expect flattish sequential growth, but on the operating expense, it seems like maybe it will start to grow faster than revenues. And just wondering with relation to focusing on getting the enterprise is going, how fast expenses will grow versus revenues.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, as we've been saying for the last several quarters, there are areas that we were not able to hire and invest in as quickly as revenue grew last year. And so, what we've been doing on the last couple of quarters is focusing on reaccelerating investment, especially in the areas of R&D, as well as for the carrying [Indiscernible], and we are absolutely continuing to do that.  We still are underinvested in R&D at a little over 5% of revenue, and the long-term target is 8% to 10%, so we're continuing too higher as quickly as we can. And then similarly in terms of quota-carrying heads, we're being very thoughtful about the segments and the regions in which we're hiring a fair number, like slipping back for a minute, there is a huge chum and it's a huge opportunity out there.  And we want to continue to add quota-carrying heads in sales capacity into our system to take advantage of that. As long as we continue to see an opportunity for growth, we will continue investing in quota-carrying heads. We are also, as I mentioned earlier, accelerating our spend in marketing as we were able to pull back a little bit on that last year.  But we think now is the right time to continue reinvesting there. And then the two areas that we always look to be as efficient as we can, our G&A and COGS. And G&A is right in the range of where we would want to be for the long term. Over time, we do expect COGS to decrease as we continue to move more and more of our services out of the public cloud into the data center, our own data centers.  I mean, we're always going to have a hybrid approach there. But also, eventually at some point when K-12 schools are freer to go back to campuses, we do expect to see improvement in our gross margin. But we will absolutely continue to support those students in schools as long as we think it's needed.\nChaim Siegel: Is there a general timing of efficiency where you would to tick in for the enterprise, for sales [Indiscernible] on the enterprise? I know you've been growing it. And I know it takes time, I was just wondering if there's timing where if they [Indiscernible] going to start really performing for you?\nKelly Steckelberg: No, I mean -- I would say is we are continuing to hire quota-carrying heads quickly and we will continue to do so. So that means there's a constant state of having a ramping rep in the system. And since we have no plans to stop hiring quota-carrying heads in the near future. But I can't say when all of a sudden, they're going to necessarily be more efficient.\nChaim Siegel: Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey, Eric, Kelly, Tom. Thanks so much for taking my questions. Good to see you all. I wanted to just ask about Zoom Events. I know initially when you've talked about the product, it was kind of pitches a little bit of a monetization factor for the Prosumer segment, right?  Helping fitness instructors, yoga instructors who run class online, but clearly, it seems like there are much grander ambitions, right? The fact that you're going to run Zoomtopia on that, I think tells us there's maybe a bigger enterprise opportunity, even as companies are looking at doing in-person conferences again, they don't want to have a strong virtual and hybrid component to it.  So, can you maybe talk a little bit about what you see as a longer-term vision with Zoom Events, especially Enterprise and maybe let's go on that? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Rishi that's a great question. So, remember last year, last October, at a Zoomtopia we reduce resuming events, you know, we started from on Zoom. And we thought about how to have the people working from home who still can't get it streaming live like filling these online classes, Zoom all those classes.  That's the reason why we decided to build the Zoom Events ever. Again, we always listen to other customers, in particular, our enterprise customers. And they all told us, there are more opportunities around the carpet events in the corporate and probably not assume a focus on the all told us, hey, we've [Indiscernible] in either better than here that.  We ought to have an EBITDA platform, they wanted us to extend that, and I didn't know how to expand it into an even bigger Annual User Conference like Zoomtopia, that's why we [Indiscernible] to our [Indiscernible], right? And a [Indiscernible] above-corporate, which is rebranded as Zoom Events. We do see a huge opportunity. And besides that, the consumer learns. It's not a card or zoom you miss anymore. This is more like on Zoom website.  We still were g aggregate all those consumer-driven events right like on fitting in a cost and [Indiscernible] plus, but if I know, if you look at our short of opportunities, assuming you went there because many of our existing customers told us we need a platform like that because it already does. They do not want to go to any other platform. They are very patient. That's the reason why they shift over our spending the database since the last ASM problem.\nRishi Jaluria: Right. Wonderful. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Well, thank you to all of our analysts, that's all the time for questions that we have for today. And then to Tom. Let's bring you back to Tom.\nTom McCallum: Great. Thank you, everybody. And we hope to speak to you more of the rest of the quarter and see you at Zoomtopia. anything else Eric?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Thank you all for you come today. Hope you all join the next mass at Zoomtopia, September 13th, and 14th. I really appreciated all your support as far as always. Thank you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. And hello everyone. We had an eventful Q2, with several highlights - the first of which was the strength in the enterprise. We were able to grow the number of enterprise customers spending more than $1 million dollars in ARR by 77% year over year. And the second highlight is the acceleration we have seen with Zoom Phone. We grew the number of customers spending more than $100,000 dollars in ARR on Zoom Phone by 241% year over year. In August, we will reach 2 million Zoom Phone seats sold, only 8 months after reaching our first million; We added 8 Zoom Phone customers with more than 10,000 seats in the first half of FY22, bringing us to a total of 26; And in Q2 we broke our record for the largest Zoom Phone deal to date twice in the same day. It is important to note that as we've just lapped our first full quarter year-over-year compare since the start of the pandemic, we have seen customers return to more thoughtful, measured buying-patterns. While revenue, profitability, and cash flow were strong in the second quarter and the first half, other metrics have begun to normalize, especially when compared to the unprecedented year-over-year comps. In Q2, total revenue grew 54% year over year to $1.02 billion dollars, marking our first billion dollar plus quarter - only five quarters after reaching a billion dollar annual run rate. The top-line result exceeded the high end of our guidance of $990 million dollars. We saw strength in our direct and channel businesses, which grew at twice the rate of our online business. Zoom Phone, Zoom Rooms and Asia Pacific growth also accelerated in the quarter. The year-over-year growth in revenue for the quarter was driven by a healthy mix between new and existing customers, where new customers accounted for approximately 74% of the incremental revenue, and existing customers accounted for 26% of the incremental revenue. Let's take a look at the key customer metrics for the quarter: We saw 131% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 2,278 customers generating more than $100,000 dollars in trailing twelve months revenue. We exited the quarter with approximately 504,900 customers with more than 10 employees, up 36% year over year and representing 64% of revenue. In Q2, customers with 10 or fewer employees represented approximately 36% of revenue, in line with Q2 last year, but down from its high of 38% in Q3 of last year. As we discussed previously, this cohort, which comprises SMBs and consumers who typically purchase online, is more volatile and we expect it to continue to decline as a percentage of revenue as customers adjust to the evolving environment. Our Net Dollar Expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees exceeded 130% for the 13th consecutive quarter as existing customers increased their spend with Zoom and upsells of Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms picked up pace. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Our Americas revenue grew 50% year over year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew 62% year over year to be approximately 33% of revenue, up from 31% a year ago. In recent quarters, we have made significant investments in our international teams. In Asia Pacific, our direct sales team drove several strong wins in the enterprise segment. However, in EMEA, we saw some headwinds, which were predominantly driven by declines in the online segment. Now turning to profitability, which was strong from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation expenses and gains or losses on strategic investments. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 76.2%, compared to 72.3% in Q2 last year and 73.9% in Q1 of this year. The sequential improvement in gross margin is mainly due to new data center capacity coming online, and lower usage during the summer months, particularly with schools. We now expect gross margin outlook to be higher than previously discussed at approximately 75% for the remainder of the fiscal year while we continue to support free K-12 education. Research and development expense grew by 89% year over year to approximately $54 million dollars. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense was approximately 5.3%, an increase from Q2 of last year, demonstrating our commitment to building out our engineering teams globally and maintaining best-in-class product and innovation. Sales and marketing expense grew by 72% year over year to $211 million dollars. Sales and marketing expense was approximately 20.7% of total revenue, an increase from Q2 of last year, mainly due to investments and hiring to drive sustainable future growth. We plan to increase investment in global sales capacity, as well as digital marketing and events to drive additional leads for our sales team across Meetings, Phone, Rooms and Events. G&A expense in the quarter grew by 73% to $89 million dollars, as we continued to scale these functions and invest in systems, automation and compliance to meet our new scale. G&A expense was approximately 8.7% of total revenue, a slight increase from Q2 of last year. The revenue upside in the quarter carried through to the bottom line, with non-GAAP operating income of $425 million dollars, exceeding our guidance. This translates to a 41.6% non-GAAP operating margin for Q2, steady with both Q2 last year and Q1 this year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.36, on approximately 306 million non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding. This result is 21 cents above the high end of our guidance and 44 cents above Q2 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.2 billion dollars, up 59% year over year from $743 million dollars. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $2.3 billion dollars, up 66% year over year from $1.4 billion dollars. We expect to recognize approximately 69% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 72% in Q2 of last year, reflecting a shift back to longer term plans. It is important to remember that because over 40% of our business is billed monthly and typically bought online, deferred revenue and RPO trends are not reliable predictors of future revenue growth. As I mentioned last quarter, the timing of our renewals has increasingly shifted to the beginning of the fiscal year, with Q1 now representing our largest renewal quarter. This shift in seasonality is a result of the significant growth we experienced in the first half of FY21. We expect this front-weighted seasonality will persist and potentially become even more pronounced given the scale of our base and practice of upselling coterminously with existing contracts. As such, we would expect total deferred revenue and RPO to be down modestly from Q2 to Q3. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.1 billion dollars in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had strong operating cash flow in the quarter of $468 million dollars, up from $401 million dollars in Q2 last year. Free cash flow was $455 million dollars, up from $373 million dollars in Q2 last year. The increase is primarily attributable to the top-line growth and disciplined spending. Looking at the remainder of the fiscal year, we expect to increase our capital expenditures related to ongoing data center expansion to support our growth outlook. Now, turning to guidance. Please note that the ever-changing nature of the global pandemic continues to impact our segments and regions in different ways. Our outlook is based on our current assessment of the business environment. Specifically, our outlook assumes that our direct and channel business will continue to experience robust growth, while our online business will be a headwind in the coming quarters as smaller customers and consumers adjust to the evolving environment. For the third quarter of FY22, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.015 to $1.02 billion dollars. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $340 to $345 million dollars. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.07 to $1.08 based on approximately 309 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY22, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.005 to $4.015 billion dollars, which would represent approximately 51% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $1.5 to $1.51 billion dollars which would represent approximately 53% to 54% year-over-year growth. Our outlook for the non-GAAP earnings per share is $4.75 to $4.79, based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. Before concluding, I'd like to welcome everyone to join us in two weeks at Zoomtopia, our two-day immersive experience that is packed with exciting product updates, guest speakers and virtual networking opportunities. And on day one of Zoomtopia, please join us for our Financial Analyst Briefing, where we will be providing you with greater detail on Zoom Phone, the platform, our channel partnerships and much more. As always, Zoom is grateful to be a driving force enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless and secure communications platform. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue-up our first question. So, I think in terms of the expansion that you're talking about the implied expansion rate that you calculated... Yeah. And I just wanted to remind you first of all, that when you calculate that, it includes all of our customer bases. And as we mentioned, we are seeing headwinds in the online segment of our business for sure.  So that's -- I would say that while we don't break out revenue, we see strength -- continued strength in the up-market enterprise in both meetings and phones, and where you're seeing that challenge in the implied metric is really coming from the online segment of our business. Yeah. So remember, the online business is primarily, not exclusively, but primarily small business and individual. And I think what we've seen is while the future of Delta is still unknown, we do see individuals especially moving around the world and feeling comfortable.  I think we were talking about most of us are probably socializing in person now, doing fewer things like Zoom Happy Hours, and that's where we are starting to see some of the challenges. So the net dollar expansion in the online segment is what's driving - pulling that number down a little bit. Yep. Yes. So, again, we continue to see strength in our upmarket. We're excited about what we're seeing in the enterprise, in Zoom Phone, in international -- and international, we all saw growth accelerate in Q2. When we look out though what we have seen is a slowdown in the online segment of the business, which again, even though the pandemic seems to be far from over, we are happy that people are feeling more comfortably out traveling, and that's really where we're seeing the slowdown. And if you back all the way up to when we gave guidance at the beginning of the year, we had expected that towards the end of the year, but it's just happened a little bit more quickly than we expected. And I mean, of course, we feel good that people are out moving around the world, but it's certainly creating some headwinds, as we've said, in the online segment of our business. Absolutely. So, we saw Zoom Rooms start to accelerate again in Q2, which is very exciting as our customers are planning and thinking about the attach rates more than doubled quarter-over-quarter from Q1 to Q2. So absolutely, companies are preparing and planning for welcoming their employees back to the office. Yes. Thank you, Steve. Yes. It's almost exactly the same timeframe because I think we had announced in December that we hit a million, and then we announced 1.5 million on our call in April and then 2 million on this call. So, it's almost exactly at the same pace. It's a little bit of both. So as we mentioned, we specifically saw some challenges in certain regions like EMEA, where the world, at least for a period of time, was a little more open again, and people are moving around. And that's where we see people taking advantage of being out in the world and seeing some slower top line bookings, as well as accelerated churn. Yes. Thank you, Meta. We saw this start a little bit in Q1 and now continue into Q2, where I think it's not necessarily measured in terms of how much they're buying, but more measured and thoughtful in how they are buying in that they want to take their time.  They're doing more complete like proof-of-concepts, for example, versus if you think about a year ago, they were in this sort of stage of trying to keep the lights on almost and buying very quickly and now they're taking the time to really be thoughtful.  And it's just \u2013 it's back to kind of the way they used to buy pre-pandemic, which is just a much more normal buying patterns. So, I think that we're back to more normal. And for the four quarters, I guess, we saw last year was really the blip and now we're back to a more normal measured approach the customers are facing. I think that certainly, the Phone is a different buying cycle, but usually by the time they get to Phone they already know Zoom. So, it's not that, that is necessarily slowing it down and just that they're taking their time to think about these decisions that they're making. Well, hi, Matt. I actually don't know exactly off the top of my head the specifics around that. We obviously are having an integrated phone and contact center solution is really important to many companies, which is why we're excited about the deal that we're working on with Five9.  And as you say, we've been partnering with them. We also have other partnerships in place as well. And so, there's nothing different about that, that has changed. I have to go back and look. I don't know exactly what the typical cap rates are between those two, though. Eric, if you have \u2013 do you have a perspective on that? Yes. So, in terms of what you're seeing in Q4, it is continued uncertainty around headwinds in the online segment, absolutely, it's driving that. And we're -- in terms of what that implies for next year, we're not ready to give FY'23 guidance today, unfortunately. So we will be prepared to do that when we get on the Q4 earnings call and, of course, we'll have a lot more earnings at that point to share with you, but that is what - exactly what continues to drive that in Q4. Well, that is like the pandemic question, right? Because it really what we've seen is this varies depending by region and by segment depending on where each of those countries or markets is in their pandemic lifecycle. And we've seen it ebb and flow over the last 18 months by market. And so that's the challenge even I think that all businesses are having right now. And thinking about the future with uncertainty - so much uncertainty around the pandemic right now, it's just difficult to forecast exactly. We are absolutely continuing to invest in our sales capacity. We are focused on certain regions, especially where we see lots of opportunities like Asia-Pac. We recently hired a new leader there, and are really excited about the progress we're already seeing with his leadership.  And then we are continuing to invest in marketing. So as we've moved post-pandemic era a little bit in terms of not hoping that, but sort of what we saw from last year with the lift in brand awareness, we're continuing now to think about how do we invest more in specific product marketing around Zoom Phone, around Zoom Rooms as well as digital marketing campaign. So, helping the community drive additional leads for all of our teams on a global basis.  And then also the channel has continued to be a really important aspect of our go-to-market. So the channel was responsible for approximately 27% of our Zoom Phone sales in Q2. We added six additional master agents, partners during Q2. So really excited about continuing to invest in the channel on a global basis. Yes. So thank you, Alex. First of all, we agree with you that really, we want everyone focused on the long-term potential of the up-market. As a reminder, in Q2, that segment of the business grew at twice the rate of the online business. So that gives you some indication of how those two segments are diverging a little bit.  And then as we look forward, I guess the best way to help you think about it is you want to look at the net dollar, the implied net dollar expansion rate that we were talking about earlier, right? You can think about what's happening there is the net dollar expansion rate for the online segment is under one, right? That gives you some idea of what's happening, again, how to think about those two different segments of our business. In terms of where is, is there a trough? I think that it's back to kind of trying to predict the pandemic, which is a difficult thing for obviously anybody in the world to do right now. And as much as we are excited about vaccines being more widely distributed, unfortunately, as we see delta continuing to grow in certain parts of the world, we have even in the last few weeks, like seeing certain pockets of strength. So, I think that that's going to depend on really what we continue to see in terms of the spread of variants around the world. In terms of net dollar expansion, we expect it to stay above 30 certainly for Q3. And then in terms of Q4, we expected to be in at least in that range, not is a quarter out. We don't know exactly, but we are going to be right in that same range still for Q4.  And then in terms of the customer growth, I think that what you are going to continue to see is ongoing growth driven by large deals. So, the customer count may slow, but as you're going to continue to see growth driven by these big deals, as we see opportunities to continue to cross-sell with Zoom Phone, as you heard, right?  We beat our two largest deals records on the same day this quarter. So really seeing opportunities there. And then as we were planning to go back to the office, also opportunities for Zoom Rooms.  And then think about doing an event. We're going to start to see opportunities for larger and larger, bigger customer wins. And I think the other thing to note, we talk about in the quarter, but just want to make sure we understand.  We had a deal this quarter that now became our new largest customer. So that's our new customer, an existing now with their up-sale right to begin the largest customer so we're continuing to see these really significant large bins. And that I expect to continue. Eric, you want to talk about -- So, I think we are seeing strength in our channel partners globally. But as you say, it's a much newer program and much smaller internationally. So excited to really -- this is one of the main focuses for our channel team, which is expanding outside of the U.S., it's focused for the rest of the year.  In terms of productivity, I don't think that it really varies. I mean we were really excited about the Telkomsel deal, which is one of our largest channel partner deals, ISP deals with date, so that's really exciting. But we've had significant wins in the U.S. as well. So not seeing dramatic differences in productivity on a global basis. Yeah. We still see free users. A large, they've really grown over the last 18 months and they're about 30% of our minute usage today as compared to like 10% pre-pandemic. That gives you an idea of the number -- we don't talk about the number of users, but that at least gives you a relative understanding of how they grow over time.  And like we always say, as Eric mentioned about our share value of care, our core value of care we really care about all those [Indiscernible] specially to keep people connected during these more difficult times. And there's always a hope that they continue to invert or that they have the opportunity to give you a new [Indiscernible] more new users to the power of Zoom. Hi. Nice to see you. So, as we've been saying for the last several quarters, there are areas that we were not able to hire and invest in as quickly as revenue grew last year. And so, what we've been doing on the last couple of quarters is focusing on reaccelerating investment, especially in the areas of R&D, as well as for the carrying [Indiscernible], and we are absolutely continuing to do that.  We still are underinvested in R&D at a little over 5% of revenue, and the long-term target is 8% to 10%, so we're continuing too higher as quickly as we can. And then similarly in terms of quota-carrying heads, we're being very thoughtful about the segments and the regions in which we're hiring a fair number, like slipping back for a minute, there is a huge chum and it's a huge opportunity out there.  And we want to continue to add quota-carrying heads in sales capacity into our system to take advantage of that. As long as we continue to see an opportunity for growth, we will continue investing in quota-carrying heads. We are also, as I mentioned earlier, accelerating our spend in marketing as we were able to pull back a little bit on that last year.  But we think now is the right time to continue reinvesting there. And then the two areas that we always look to be as efficient as we can, our G&A and COGS. And G&A is right in the range of where we would want to be for the long term. Over time, we do expect COGS to decrease as we continue to move more and more of our services out of the public cloud into the data center, our own data centers.  I mean, we're always going to have a hybrid approach there. But also, eventually at some point when K-12 schools are freer to go back to campuses, we do expect to see improvement in our gross margin. But we will absolutely continue to support those students in schools as long as we think it's needed. No, I mean -- I would say is we are continuing to hire quota-carrying heads quickly and we will continue to do so. So that means there's a constant state of having a ramping rep in the system. And since we have no plans to stop hiring quota-carrying heads in the near future. But I can't say when all of a sudden, they're going to necessarily be more efficient. Thank you."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and thank you, all, and welcome to everyone joining us on today's Webinar. I want to start by thanking our customers and partners for their trust and loyalty, which led to our continued strong revenue growth alongside remarkable profitability and free cash flow. We also want to thank our hard working employees for their dedication to delivering happiness to our customers and partners. I have been humbled by the stories of how finance professionals have leveraged Zoom to reimagine the way they work. Specifically, I'd like to thank Charlie Munger of Berkshire Hathaway for his remarks about how Zoom has added so much convenience to his life. We are so delighted to count Charlie as a happy user. And I nominate myself to be Charlie's personal Zoom tech support if he ever needs it. In Q2, we also achieved several milestones, setting the foundation for us to thrive as a platform. In July, we launched Zoom Apps, which brings over 50 apps right into the Zoom meeting experience. And this is just the beginning. The beauty of our platform is it allows our ecosystem of developers to add even more functionality, by building apps where workflows are integrated with meeting interactions. This is a win-win because better integrations will boost our customer's productivity and afford our developers exposure to our large user base. The Zoom Apps Fund, which has already invested in over a dozen startups in our Zoom Apps and SDK ecosystem, further aligns us with developers, enabling them to focus more on innovation. We are also excited to have launched Zoom Events in July. Zoom Events is an easy, yet powerful solution to produce and host company and public events. It acts as a layer above our existing Zoom Video Webinars and Zoom Meetings products. Zoomtopia will be virtual on Zoom Events in only two weeks and we hope to see all of you there. In Q2, we saw several large customer upsells. We were happy to expand with a leading tech firm who increased their Meetings licenses over sixfold to 95,000, and with a global financial services customer who added over 63,000 Zoom Phone licenses, making them our new largest customer. Both wins were displacements of legacy solutions that Zoom beat in terms of reliability, simplicity and integration. And let me recognize a few big wins for the quarter: I want to welcome NEC Corporation to the Zoom family. Based out of Japan, NEC is a leader in the integration of IT and network technologies behind their slogan: \u201cOrchestrating a brighter world\u201d. In order to enhance the productivity, collaboration and happiness of their global workforce, NEC deployed approximately 110,000 Zoom Meetings licenses. I also want to welcome Seagate Technology to the Zoom family. Seagate is a global mass-data storage infrastructure leader innovating world-class, precision-engineered data storage and management solutions with a focus on sustainable partnerships. Seagate recently decided to modernize and integrate their global communications infrastructure with over 14,000 Zoom Meetings licenses and over 17,000 Zoom Phone licenses. Next is a Zoom Phone upsell. In Q2 of last year, we welcomed ExxonMobil, which develops and applies next-generation technologies to help safely and responsibly meet the world's growing needs for energy and chemical products, to the Zoom family. They began as a Zoom Video conferencing customer to enable their teams to collaborate globally. We are grateful to have seen our partnership evolve over the past year and excited that ExxonMobil has recently decided to add Zoom Phone to further enhance the user experience for their global workforce leveraging a communications platform that is easy to deploy and manage. In addition to these great customer wins, we also closed another strategic channel partnership with Telkomsel, the largest cellular operator in Indonesia, which is the world's fourth largest country by population. Telkomsel understands and wants to support their 170 million subscribers' need for seamless and reliable virtual meetings to thrive in the digital workplace era. They will be leveraging the power of Zoom's Developer Platform and ISV Partner Program to deliver a fully integrated solution via their CloudX offering for the Enterprise segment and Zoom native apps for the Consumer segment. The collaboration between Telkomsel and Zoom will bring communication to the next level by combining Zoom's strong capabilities and feature-rich platform with Telkomsel's best quality network and localized interface, together creating a powerful tool to improve customer productivity and collaboration. Thank you NEC, Seagate, ExxonMobil, and Telkomsel. I love you all. Enterprises want digital platforms that combine meetings, phone, events, office technology, and developer solutions in a way that is simple, reliable, and frictionless. This fundamental truth underpins our leadership position in video conferencing, and will help to drive further growth in Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms, as we expand our platform and addressable market in the hybrid world. Today we are fortunate to be a leading global brand with over half a million customers having more than 10 employees. Our internal innovation engine is strong, and bolstered by our growing Zoom Apps developer ecosystem and acquisitions such as Kites, that will strengthen our position in AI transcription and translation. As organizations and people reimagine work, communications and collaboration, we are faced with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to drive this evolution on multiple fronts. Thanks again to the hard work of our over 5,700 employees and the trust of our loyal customers, we are positioned well to be successful as a platform embracing and enabling hybrid work. I'm very excited about the future, the journey has only begun. And with that let me pass it over to Kelly. Yes, sure. So, Matt, if you look at our installed base, right, by now I think they really wanted to migrate from on-prem PBX system to the cloud, right? That's where the huge opportunities that comes from. Also, since the pandemic, I think that we do see some of the enterprise customers.  They also started asking about, \"Hey, what's your cloud contact center strategy because they started at planning now, right? That's why we think this is kind of the new opportunity for us, not only for the brand and new revenue stream for contact center, but also it might have - further grow our Phone business as well. Because like about a year ago, right, where a few large invest customers they really wanted to migrate on-prem contact center to us.  Now, given the digital transformation for almost every enterprise customers, we do see more and more customers that are very interested. That's why timing-wise, it's perfect for us to double down on the progress the contact center grows. So, Matt, before I answer to that questions, as you know, our company values care. The number one we're seeing is really about our community, right? For us to support K-12 schools, this \u2013 I would say that's a no-brainer for us to support that at no cost, right? We feel very proud.  We never thought about how to monetize our service for those K-12 schools, right? Now they all go back to the school, right? With that, we're having more resources to think about how to monetize other installed bases.  I give an example, like free users. Last year, we were extremely busy to have the world - to have people stay connected. We even did not have banners to think about how to monetize those free users, right, I mean, how to embrace with the consumer, right? We never thought about that before. Now it's the right time, right? How to think about embracing the consumer's credit. How to monetize those free users. It's something we're very excited. We do not want to monetize those K-12 schools. It's our responsibility to have with us as always. Thank you, Matt. Sure. I would say, Patrick, that's a great question. First of all, you look at it prior to the pandemic, look at our growth, always focused on the enterprise customers, right? We're the first service videoconferencing. We introduced a second revenue stream, Zoom Phone, both of them are doing well and how to introduce the third one or fourth one.  How to double down on that? But there's always our thought, right? If \u2013 we did not realize this is due to pandemic crisis, otherwise several years ago, probably, we should have planned sort of hospice services beforehand.  Now, actually, now this indeed can get our strategy, right, how to introduce more and more revenue stream, new services to support our enterprise customer. That's always part of us. Essentially, this is a part of our overall platform strategy, right? I mean, aside from that, also, there's a new opportunity ahead of us. As I mentioned earlier, right, we never realized there are so many consumers, right, and who are so loyal to our - the platform, right? The usage is still pretty healthy, how to embrace the consumer's credit is also something on top of our minds as well, right? We never thought about that before. it's the right time. For those two things, enterprise platform and also consumer, those two things will drive our future growth. Thank you, Patrick. Yes. To add on to what Kelly said, our user base in EMEA, seasonality also is a factor, right? In particular, in the summertime, not to mention that COVID situation and the user there might have a little bit longer vacation, right? It's seasonality for sure is the key factor, and that's another big difference compared to our user base here. Thank you. Yes. Ryan, I would say, first of all, with our top two market is not education and healthcare is pretty strong and also will bring us more opportunities when we expand it into the international market like APAC. And also, like those telco, Telkomsel, right? Those kind of a telco partnership will further help us for us to penetrate into each of those APAC countries, right, and to most of the new opportunities.  Recently, we launched Zoom Apps. And also, like some of the partners, they build new solution upon our platform, like fast technologies, right? I think a lot of new opportunities, right, we do not need to go build up by ourselves, right?  And those sort of party customers, they can leverage our either API or SDK, or Zoom App to build all kinds of new the solutions to focus on all those vertical markets, or even at the department as well, right? That's where the opportunities are coming from. Yeah, both, actually. Yes, because in those third-party partners, a little bit of very healthy business also bringing the Zoom to the installed base and also by establishing a trust, right? We also obviously are in most stock, right? Essentially, it's a very healthy channel, not only for their own business and whatever, but also it's a greater channel for us. Thank you, Ryan. I think overall, I think our up-market are doing, especially look at in North America [being in a swipe] [ph] In EMEA, I think the mass-market online SMB I think it did not do well last quarter. Seasonality, COVID situation, for sure, made things a little bit worse because they're longer vacation [Indiscernible]. Here, look at our North America market, I think, the upsell Phone and also the Zoom Rooms because every Company, I think, they're starting to go back to the office. The new opportunities are coming. They're also doing very well. That's why I say even if a little bit of challenge on SMB, by and large, we did not see the big profit. And because offset by the hybrid of work opportunities, right? I think if you look at APAC. APAC, we did not see that at all, right, in the last quarter, it's still doing very well. I think overall, we - as you mentioned earlier, we've got to go back to our enterprise. Because the last year, I think the online business used to be just a marketing channel, right? But, however, not only marketing channel, but also contribute a lot to our revenue from a percentage perspective.  Now, it came with that, that percentage is going down for online. In a balance, it's very healthy for our rates, right? With that, we can focus on our core enterprise customer. And plus, given that, we've become a household name, it will bring a new opportunity to monetize, used to be the monetization for online loan and users, just the online subscription.  I would say that may not be the sustainable strategy, right, to further online users' monetization. We've got to have other ways, right, monetize those online \u2013 the installed base. That's why we are very excited about our future. Thank you, Alex. James, that's a great observation. You are so right. I think one year ago we really did not see that. Normally we buy more licenses and as Bob probably alluded to our sales, and also for the existing installer base, the upsell of Phones.  For the brand-new customers, because of the cost of looking at one platform on both video and voice, we understand video and voice are converging into one platform, plus in our Zoom [Indiscernible] is very mature now, every quarter being very well [Indiscernible], it is not like this is something brand new.  They do not want to take any risk. Is very mature, plus the integrated screen, both video and [Indiscernible], Essentially, from now, I would say probably I don't know, but I guess probably more and more customers who view is going to deploy video for us and it didn't deploy. Today on the last biggest both given the dynamics of each business, sometimes probably they wanted to deploy more Zoom seats than the [Indiscernible]. Thank you, James. Sure. I think we look at it, the churn, the future work, hybrid work for short that will be the mainstream, right? And however, and because of the cost of embracing hybrid work, a lot of employees like a student working from a home, or maybe work the remitted locations, and another [Indiscernible], the prior to pandemic crisis quite often, and you might have deployed loosen.  This is good enough, right? And giving employees now to support the hybrid work, the best way to service will do very well. Look at our employees, they do not have, I just part, you know, sitting next to them, right? And approximately you need to worry the productivity if you do not give the best for tools.  That's why in the good enough services, we're not doing well. Every business we would like to deploy the best-of-breed service. But always give the employees much better tools to improve their productivity, to help employees because to support a hybrid world is not that straightforward, right? I'll give you one example, like a complement solution, we're producing [Indiscernible] feature.  All of which, customers, they do not care to have a meeting by somebody assisting in the conference room, some join remotely, that experience is not as good as the big, the webinar on me too right. That's why I think the hybrid work, certainly we'll have Zoom by even some of sometimes our competitors the mile of evidence of price.  I think the good news is the customer really wants to have a very reliable fixing us the platform, you know very easy to use. I think that's the reason why I think that Zoom is positioned much better than any of our competitors. Thank you, Matt. Go ahead. Rishi that's a great question. So, remember last year, last October, at a Zoomtopia we reduce resuming events, you know, we started from on Zoom. And we thought about how to have the people working from home who still can't get it streaming live like filling these online classes, Zoom all those classes.  That's the reason why we decided to build the Zoom Events ever. Again, we always listen to other customers, in particular, our enterprise customers. And they all told us, there are more opportunities around the carpet events in the corporate and probably not assume a focus on the all told us, hey, we've [Indiscernible] in either better than here that.  We ought to have an EBITDA platform, they wanted us to extend that, and I didn't know how to expand it into an even bigger Annual User Conference like Zoomtopia, that's why we [Indiscernible] to our [Indiscernible], right? And a [Indiscernible] above-corporate, which is rebranded as Zoom Events. We do see a huge opportunity. And besides that, the consumer learns. It's not a card or zoom you miss anymore. This is more like on Zoom website.  We still were g aggregate all those consumer-driven events right like on fitting in a cost and [Indiscernible] plus, but if I know, if you look at our short of opportunities, assuming you went there because many of our existing customers told us we need a platform like that because it already does. They do not want to go to any other platform. They are very patient. That's the reason why they shift over our spending the database since the last ASM problem. Thank you. Yes. Thank you all for you come today. Hope you all join the next mass at Zoomtopia, September 13th, and 14th. I really appreciated all your support as far as always. Thank you."

Their dedication to our customers\u2019 happiness is an incredible advantage and creates a positive feedback loop that keeps our customers coming back and our employees eager to meet their diverse needs. Our ability to help our customers by increasing their productivity, promoting their employees\u2019 happiness and connections to each other and reducing their travel-related carbon footprint gives our work great meaning and makes Zoom a great place to work. Our company culture is strong and we are more motivated than ever. Let me also thank all of you, our investors, for your trust and support. So we are very grateful to our employees, our customers, partners and our investors. Thank you. As parts of the world reopened, a few things are clear. First, many customers I talk to are looking to create hybrid solutions as they seek to cautiously reopen some offices; and second, each industry, company and individual varies in their optimal working model. Zoom is here to help each customer calibrate their future working model in their own way. Many companies are redesigning the workplace to enhance the hybrid work experience. So, to meet this need, we announced Zoom Rooms features such as smart gallery, which puts in-room and remote participants in equal footing, virtual receptionist, participant counting, and environmental sensors. We have begun to deliver on our platform strategy. In February, we launched our video SDK. In April, we announced our $100 million Zoom Apps Fund to further build our app ecosystem. Zoom Apps is designed to enhance users \u2013 to enable users to bring their favorite apps directly into the Zoom experience in a way that inspires collaboration, boosts the efficiency, creates healthier habits and generates much more fun. We will also launch Zoom Events, our events platform, which will be focused on our enterprise customers and support an array of virtual event use cases. In a recent study we conducted, 80% of U.S. respondents agreed that all interactions will continue to have a virtual element post-pandemic, and that figure was even higher in many of the other markets we are serving. The hybrid model is here to stay and Zoom Events will be an excellent solution for our customers who are looking to create and host the company events with a versatile and powerful solution. We are very happy to announce that we closed our largest deal ever in terms of ARR, with a leading global financial services firm that selected Zoom Meetings to deploy for over 90,000 hosts. That is only one of the large deals we closed this quarter. Let me recognize three more industry-leading companies that have increased their commitment to Zoom. First, I want to thank Kimberly-Clark, whose trusted brands are an indispensable part of life for people in more than 175 countries, for expanding the relationship with Zoom by adding approximately 25,000 Zoom Phone licenses. As an existing Zoom Meetings and Video Webinar customer, Kimberly-Clark saw the same reliability, value and innovation in Zoom Phone. I also wanted to recognize our partner, British Telecom for advocating for Zoom in the decision-making process at Kimberly-Clark. Next, thank you, Target Corporation, which serves guests at more than 1,900 stores and online at Target.com with the mission to help families discover the joy of everyday life for their commitment to Zoom. We are very excited to help Target take their communications initiatives to the next level by expanding their Zoom platform solution while unifying their internal and external communications on our technology. As a longstanding Zoom Meetings customer, we truly appreciate their trust and faith in Zoom as a platform and partner. And finally, I want to thank Denso, Japan\u2019s largest and the world\u2019s second largest automotive parts company, and a leading company in the Toyota Group. They first joined the Zoom family last year, but last quarter, they decided to significantly expand their usage of Zoom Meetings and Zoom Video Webinars for internal and external communications. Zoom now connects 47,000 employees across offices, factories and homes. Denso said the introduction of Zoom has contributed greatly to our ability to create a work environment that drives faster decision-making. Kimberly-Clark, Target and Denso, thank you. Love you. We are off to a great start in fiscal 2022. I look forward to updating you on our hybrid workspace and a platform evolution throughout the year and at Zoomtopia, which will be held on September 13 and 14 in a virtual format. Before handing it over to Kelly, I want to share a quick update. As you know, demand for Zoom Phone has been amazing and I am very excited to announce our new device category, the Zoom Phone Appliance. I have invited Graeme to tell you more. Thank you.\nGraeme Geddes: Thanks, Eric. Hi, everyone. I am Graeme Geddes. I am the Head of Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms and I am excited to be joining the call today from, you guessed it, my Zoom Phone Appliance. Our new Zoom Phone Appliances allow our customers to take advantage of the powerful audio and video capabilities of Zoom and they are a great solution for touchdown spaces, huddle rooms and executive offices alike. We also can\u2019t wait to see some of the vertical applications that our customers come up with for this new category as well. And while I am here, I have got some exciting news to share. I think I will use the whiteboarding feature of this device. So at the end of December, we announced reaching 1 million seats of Zoom Phones sold. Well, that momentum continues and I am excited to announce that we have now surpassed 1.5 million seats of Zoom Phones sold as of the end of September. It\u2019s been absolutely amazing to see the growth continue to accelerate. Thank you for allowing me to join you today. And now, I will turn it over to Kelly.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Graeme and thanks to you and your team for your hard work and for that amazing accomplishments. Hello, everybody. Our impressive growth story continued in Q1. As you can see, we continued to win awards and third-party recognition for our strong security focus, empowering company culture and lasting impact on society. Thank you to all of our amazing customers and employees who made these accolades possible. In Q1, the year-over-year growth of total revenue remained strong at 191%, reaching $956 million. The top line results exceeded the high end of our guidance of $905 million due to strong sales and marketing execution, led by our direct and channel businesses as well as lower than expected churn. Demand was widespread across products, industry verticals, geographies, new logos and customer cohorts. It\u2019s also worth noting that our fiscal 2020 results have shifted our renewal seasonality, which is now more weighted towards the beginning of the year. To illustrate, we saw approximately 4x more deals up for renewal in Q1 of FY \u201822 as compared to Q1 of last year. Our renewals, sales and online marketing teams really outperformed its differing renewals and the success is a testament to their hard work and our products strong and lasting value proposition. The year-over-year growth in revenue for the quarter was driven by a healthy mix between new and existing customers, where new customers accounted for approximately 57% of the incremental revenue and existing customers accounted for 43% of the incremental revenue. This trend towards existing customers was expected considering the tremendous growth in our base last year. Let\u2019s take a look at the key customer metrics for the quarter. We saw growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 1,999 customers generating more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. We exited the quarter with approximately 497,000 customers, with more than 10 employees, adding approximately 30,000 customers during the quarter. In Q1, customers with more than 10 employees represented approximately 63% of revenue. We also continue to benefit from solid growth in our segment of customers with 10 or fewer employees. In Q1, customers with 10 or fewer employees represented approximately 37% of revenue, up from 30% in Q1 last year and stable quarter-over-quarter. Our net dollar expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees exceeded 130% for the 12th consecutive quarter as customers acquired more Zoom Meetings, Rooms, Webinars and Phone products. For this customer subset, we expect the net dollar expansion rate to remain above 130% for the next few quarters. For customers with 10 or fewer employees, which are not included in its net dollar expansion metric, we expect that cohort to be lower than FY \u201821 as more volatile \u2013 and more volatile as economies continue to reopen. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Our Americas revenue grew 159% year-over-year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew 288% year-over-year to be approximately 34% of revenue, up from 25% a year ago. In recent quarters, we made significant investments in our international teams, which have already begun to pay dividends. The global opportunity remains large and we will continue to empower our team to capitalize on it. Now, turning to profitability. The increase in demand and strong execution drove net income profitability from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspective. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock, acquisition-related expenses and net litigation expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter was 73.9% compared to 69.4% in Q1 last year and 71.3% in Q4. The sequential improvement in gross margin is mainly due to optimization of public cloud resources. We expect gross margin to remain relatively stable in the low 70s as long as we continue to support free K-12 education. Research and development expense grew by 97% year-over-year to approximately $41 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense was approximately 4.3%, which is lower than in Q1 of last year, mainly due to the strong top line growth. However, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, expenses grew by 33%, demonstrating our commitment to building out our engineering teams globally and maintaining best-in-class product and innovation. Sales and marketing expense grew by 84% year-over-year to $191 million. This reflects an additional $87 million over last year primarily due to investments in hiring to drive future growth. Sales and marketing expense was approximately 20% of total revenue, a decrease from Q1 of last year, mainly due to strong top line growth. We plan to continue to invest in adding global sales capacity and brand and product marketing programs in order to capitalize in our growing leadership position and growth initiatives. G&A expense in the quarter grew by 51% to $73 million as we continue to scale these functions and invest in systems, automation and compliance to meet our new scale. G&A expense was approximately 7.7% of total revenue, a decrease from Q1 of last year. Revenue upside in the quarter carried through to the bottom line, with non-GAAP operating income of $401 million, exceeding our guidance. This translates to a 41.9% non-GAAP operating margin for Q1, a large improvement from 16.6% in Q1 last year and a slight improvement from 40.9% in Q4. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1, was $1.32 on approximately 305 million non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding. This result is $0.35 above the high-end of our guidance and $1.12 above Q1 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.1 billion, up 98% year-over-year from $552 million. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $2.1 billion, up 94% year-over-year from $1.1 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 72% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, consistent with the level of this metric last year. It\u2019s important to remember that deferred revenue and RPO trends are not reliable predictors of future revenue growth due to the large percent of monthly billings in our customer base. In addition, the timing of our renewals has increasingly shifted to the beginning of the fiscal year, with Q1 now representing our largest renewal quarter. We expect sequential increases in deferred revenue and RPO in each of the remaining quarters be lower as our available population of annual renewals is smaller. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had exceptional operating cash flow in the quarter of $533 million, up from $259 million in Q1 of last year. Free cash flow was $454 million, up from $252 million in Q1 of last year. The increase is primarily attributable to strong sales execution and collections. Looking at the rest of the fiscal year, we expect to increase our capital expenditures related to ongoing datacenter expansion to support our growth outlook. We also expect a legal settlement, which will be disclosed in our 10-Q to be a cash outflow in late FY \u201822. Now, turning to guidance. We are pleased to raise our outlook for Q2 FY \u201822 and the full fiscal year. Please note that the impact and extent of the global pandemic still remain largely unknown. Our outlook is based on our current assessment of the business environment as well as our own research and conversations with customers. For the second quarter of FY \u201822, we expect revenue to be in the range of $985 million to $990 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $355 million to $360 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.14 to $1.15 based on approximately 311 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY \u201822, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.975 billion to $3.99 billion, which would represent approximately 50% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $1.425 billion to $1.44 billion, which would represent approximately 45% to 46% year-over-year growth. Our outlook for the non-GAAP earnings per share is $4.56 to $4.61 based on approximately 311 million shares outstanding. Before concluding, I am happy to highlight that we recently launched our ESG website, which can be found on our Investor Relations and corporate website. We also recently published our Social Impact report, which can be found on our Zoom Cares website. Giving back to the community has always been a key tenant of what we do at Zoom. We look forward to updating our investors as we continue along our ESG journey. As always, Zoom is grateful to be a driving force, enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless and secure communications platform. Thank you, the entire team, our customers, our community and our investors. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue up our first question.\nA - Matthew Caballero: And our first question is from Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer. Ittai, you are on mute.\nIttai Kidron: [Technical Difficulty] milestone today announced 1.5 million. I am trying to think in the past, I think you launched Phones in early 2019. So, it took I guess, a couple of years to get to 1 million and then 5 months to add another 0.5 million. Although at the beginning, you didn\u2019t have the global availabilities you had and plus you weren\u2019t pushing as hard at least in the beginning from the sales standpoint. So, help me think about what is the pace of addition, Kelly or should we peg this to about 100,000 per month addition? Is that \u2013 sounds like the more recent kind of track record here? And maybe also you can talk about the success of Zoom United, your ability to kind of bundle Meetings, Phone and Chat together. How much of your renewal activity comes in United right now versus maybe a quarter or two ago? How successful are you in that effort?\nKelly Steckelberg: So, we are really excited about the momentum of Zoom Phone and it was great to have Graeme as a guest star today on our call. And what I think you are seeing and what you are gathering, Ittai, is that there is definitely increased momentum happening there. So, it took us seven quarters to get to that $1 million \u2013 I mean that 1 million seats level. And then, yes, that was in December. So, it\u2019s taken us about 5 months to add an additional 500,000 seats to that number. So, it doesn\u2019t happen exactly. Equally, each of those months, right, as you can imagine, there are trends at the end of the quarter, but we absolutely are seeing an acceleration in the momentum there and we are very excited about it.\nIttai Kidron: And with respect to the United plans, how much of your renewal activity comes in this type of a bundle form?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So absolutely, our salespeople take the opportunity when there is a renewal to talk about cross-selling and up-selling. In terms of the specific packages themselves, we aren\u2019t going to disclose the actual breakout of that, but a lot of what you saw disclosed in the revenue coming from new customers is the opportunity they saw to up-sell either Zoom Phone or Webinars or Rooms as people are thinking about going back into the office spaces again.\nIttai Kidron: That\u2019s great. Thanks, guys. Good luck.\nEric Yuan: Ittai, just quickly to add on to what Kelly said, when it comes to Zoom Phone growth, what\u2019s fascinating is that is about our product innovation, reliability, security, availability, all the very good features. There are so many customers, no matter which solution they deployed before either on-prem or other cloud-based home solutions, they all like Zoom solutions.\nIttai Kidron: Right. Very good. Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nMatthew Caballero: Our next question is from Dan Bartus with Bank of America.\nDan Bartus: Hey, guys.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Dan.\nDan Bartus: Great to see you. Thanks for taking the question. So Kelly, you had modeled heightened churn in the first half of this year related to renewals coming up. Based on what you are seeing, what\u2019s the reality? Do upmarket renewals really mean heightened churn or is it showing more of an enhanced expansion opportunity versus what you expected? And maybe just continuing with the churn theme on the other side of the business, the 1 to 10 employee base, I am just curious, what\u2019s the latest of what you are seeing in the second half of this year and any reason to be more optimistic than when you started this year? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, we were really pleased. And as I said, great thanks to all of our renewals and sales and online marketing teams for their great work done in Q1 as we had a better-than-expected result in terms of not only retaining customers, but also up-selling them during Q1, especially in that cohort of customers with greater than 10 employees. So, that\u2019s really exciting to see as we expect that momentum to continue as we carry through the year. We see significant renewals also coming up in Q2 as well. In terms of the customer segment with fewer than 10 employees, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are still expecting that to be more volatile as that\u2019s a segment that we have seen over the last 15 months has reacted more quickly to the openings and potential closings of markets around the globe.\nDan Bartus: Alright, great. Thanks guys.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Dan.\nMatthew Caballero: Our next question is from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on another great report. I guess first for Kelly and then I have got a quick one for you, Eric. Kelly, the unending debate on the stock, I believe is that, what does growth look like in 2022? And I know that you are not going to guide there now and we understand the churn is an unknown factor. But can you help us better understand the trend that you do have control over today? Specifically, how much have you increased your quota-carrying capacity relative to pre-pandemic levels? What are you seeing on the productivity of the sales organization relative to pre-pandemic and what\u2019s driving that productivity today?\nKelly Steckelberg: So first of all, we continue to see tremendous opportunity. We were thrilled with the performance in the upmarket in Q1. As Eric just talked about, we had our largest deal to-date and we had some amazing customer wins. And so we are continuing to invest in our direct and our channel sales organizations, especially. And we have seen pretty consistent sales productivity. It\u2019s going back to levels that are more reflective of pre-pandemic, but at an elevated level from there given the benefit we have of the global brand awareness, our expanded portfolio of products. And so we are really excited about the future, especially in that upmarket and international as well. As you heard, we are 34% of revenue and then, of course, we look to Zoom Phone and the continuing momentum that we are seeing there.\nAlex Zukin: And then, Eric, the return to office is on everyone\u2019s mind. Looking at some recent articles, I think it\u2019s on your mind as well. With that, it will be logical to think about Zoom Rooms as really starting to become a material growth driver in this new and developing hybrid world. Can you talk about what you are seeing from that product today? How do you think about the opportunity in terms of just the sheer number of conference rooms that are out there and what are your most forward-thinking clients doing today and how is that impacting the spend relative to \u2013 that you are seeing?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Alex, that\u2019s a great question. First of all, I want to say I am a fan of you, because you will regularly update some kind of \u2013 daily update about what\u2019s going on, on SaaS market. Very well done, Alex. Thank you. I think when it comes to Zoom Rooms, that\u2019s a huge opportunity, in particular, for every business when they are reopening their office, because the way to setup Zoom Rooms or the comp rooms are very different. They like, as I mentioned earlier, right, we have a smarter gallery view, which puts Zoom participants and remote participants on equal footing. That kind of experience I did not see requested before. But in the future, more and more like that, a lot of innovation are on the Zoom Rooms. I would say this is probably the third revenue driver in terms of usage and lots of new use cases. Also, what\u2019s more important is that when it comes to the comp room or Zoom Room setup, customers like consistent experience meaning when they are back at home, because the future is about a hybrid. When they are working from home, they also want to have a consistent experience. That\u2019s another reason why a customer not only do they deploy the desktop Zoom Meeting or Webinar or Zoom, but also they like the comp room experience as well. So that\u2019s another driver for our customers to standardize on Zoom platform, for Meetings, for Webinar or the Phone, again, a lot of innovation in the pipeline for the Zoom Rooms.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you, guys. Appreciate the color, guys.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Alex.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Alex.\nMatthew Caballero: Our next question is from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. He is joining through audio-only. Patrick, are you there? You can press star 6 to unmute yourself.\nPatrick Walravens: Hi, sorry, in the car. You don\u2019t want to see that. Eric, I would love to hear what your \u2013 is there sort of like three strategic imperatives that you have for this year? I\u2019d love to hear what you think they are?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So Patrick, yes, drive safely. Yes\u2026\nPatrick Walravens: I am driving very safely.\nEric Yuan: Thank you. I think I want to share with you my personal priority I would share with the company key initiatives, right. So I share with our team when we started the year, for me, I think three top priorities for me as the CEO, right. Number one is really make sure focus on our company culture, to maintain the company culture, evolve our company culture because you have so many new employees coming on board remotely. Number two is double down my time on the platform, the platform, platform, right. It\u2019s not only [indiscernible] video in the business, but also the overall platform. Last but not the least, about some of the very big large and strategic deals, that\u2019s more like my personal part. If you look at it Zoom from a strategy perspective, first of all, I think how to make sure support all those businesses reopen and reenter their offices. That\u2019s very, very important. That\u2019s why you see a lot of innovations are around that angle, right, either the conference room or the phone, in building the chat or meetings, that\u2019s number one the initiatives. Number two is really about the international market expansion. There is a huge opportunity. From 25% to more than 30%, I think we do see a lot of opportunities from other, EMEA, APAC, Japan, a lot of opportunities, right. We got to invest more. That\u2019s the second thing. Last but not least is overall how to make sure with our platform strategy works, how to double down our platform driven by our Zoom Events, Zoom Apps and UC platform and also our HD capabilities, I think that essentially that will set us up for the future growth if we can invest more to our platform.\nPatrick Walravens: That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you so much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Patrick.\nMatthew Caballero: Next, we have Sterling Auty with JPMorgan.\nSterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. Great to see you. I love the Zoom Pride logo. So first, just wanted to start out with, you added about $74 million in revenue quarter-over-quarter this quarter in about 30,000 customers. If I look at that same addition last quarter, it actually mathematically points to the average new customer being smaller this quarter than what we saw last quarter. Is that what you are seeing in the business or is there something else going on underneath those metrics?\nKelly Steckelberg: I think that it actually depends on when it is in the quarter in terms of the renewals. So think about, especially Q1 has this very weird timing from last year, where all of those \u2013 like the real dramatic change in the business happened on March 15, so literally halfway through the business. So what you \u2013 we don\u2019t have the full benefit of all of those renewals yet in this quarter. You are going to see it come into next quarter. And unfortunately, Q1 is always going to have that kind of funny phenomenon, because most people co-term with their original date, which was sometime after March 15 in last year.\nSterling Auty: Got it.\nEric Yuan: Also, Sterling, I would like to add a little bit more, if you look at Q1 or Q2 last fiscal year in terms of revenue growth driven by a lot of online buyers like for Zoom consumer SMB business. Starting Q1, we do see \u2013 driven by large customers, enterprise customers, right, also the Zoom Phone as well, we closed our largest ever deal, right? This is a very good thing. I think this is \u2013 that\u2019s a future trend, right, driven by our business customers.\nSterling Auty: That makes sense. And then maybe one quick follow-up, can you give us an update on your plans and where you are to monetize on Zoom and Zoom Events?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So Zoom has two parts. One is about the corporate events. Another one is about consumer or consumer events. I think our plan is to launch our corporate events first. Essentially, we have so many webinar customers. They are looking for a lot of new innovations. Essentially, they can\u2019t run their annual user conference everything online. That\u2019s why we doubled down our Events platform. I think we are going to focus on the corporate events first. And then later this year, we also want to probably get our consumer events. Essentially, you have time, you have a Zoom Meeting host account, you can sell tickets, you can teach anything online. That\u2019s more like the opportunity for the second half of this year.\nSterling Auty: Makes sense. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Sterling.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Sterling.\nMatthew Caballero: Our next question is from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Kelly, you noted the gross margin pickup was largely due to kind of gains and efficiency, but just was there any contribution from students maybe returning to in-person and just less usage from students that\u2019s worth calling out? And then maybe second question, just \u2013 you also noted that international is continuing to see traction from a lot of those channel investments you made kind of at the time of the IPO. Just where are you on channel development in the U.S. versus international and just how do you see that developing? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, in terms of the gross margin, it was really was more around continuing to optimize with our public cloud partners. As we have scaled up, we have had the opportunity to work with them on better pricing packages. And that\u2019s really what that\u2019s attributed to rather than seeing a dramatic shift yet in students going back to school. As we have talked about before, there is a pretty significant impact on the gross margin due to the free K-12. And what we expect is that is going to do what you say, that was going to come in over time. If all of a sudden, they were to go back-to-school, you would see a pretty dramatic step function improvement in the gross margin, but I expect that you are going to see that probably happen starting in the fall as more and more students are able to safely go back to the school. And then in terms of international expansion, specifically around the channel, this is a really great question. We had a discussion about that in the last couple of weeks. So, the team has done a really good job in focusing on our U.S. channel strategy, especially around Zoom Phone and building out our master agent program and we are now working on building that out internationally. It\u2019s probably guessing, but we are probably where we were in the U.S. a year ago or so. So, it\u2019s probably about a year behind in terms of our international channel strategy. So, it\u2019s great that there is opportunity ahead and Laura Padilla and her team are working on that now.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks, guys.\nMatthew Caballero: Our next question is from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hey, Kelly and Eric. Thanks for the questions and Kelly, actually happy early birthday tomorrow.\nKelly Steckelberg: Happy early birthday to you too, James.\nJames Fish: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: It\u2019s your birthday.\nJames Fish: Yes. Eric, you guys noted a win with Kimberly-Clark for Zoom Phone, yet one of your competitors cite \u2013 really cite BT as one of their key partners. Are you penetrating those tech incumbents that have, in theory, really open up their installed bases more? And I am specifically talking like an Avaya, for example, more than you were last year as well as what are you hearing with carriers about partnership opportunities?\nEric Yuan: I think, first of all, I think as Kelly mentioned earlier, right, not only driven by our direct business team. When it comes to Zoom Phone, by and large, a lot of our customers we already built a brilliant relationship with those carriers or partners or master agent, we are already doubling down on that, right. This is essentially become more and more important into our Zoom Phone growth. That\u2019s our strategy. And inside of that, every time when we work together with our channel partners or carriers, take British Telecom, for example, when we are working together with our potential prospects, after they valued our Zoom service, it\u2019s just they not only realized this service works so well, but also look at \u2013 we shared the roadmap with them. They said, wow. That\u2019s amazing because compared with any other solutions, I mean in other cloud-based phone solutions, really like our roadmap, really like the usability and integration with the video meetings, webinars and also the reliability plus security. And that\u2019s the reason why we are winning, right, British Telecom, they allocate for Zoom at Kimberly-Clark. This is a huge deployment. I think overall, we see more and more deals like that. It\u2019s particular in customers to test our solutions. We have high confidence Zoom Phone is much more innovative than any other solutions for them.\nJames Fish: That\u2019s helpful. If I can sneak in one more, obviously, some exciting announcements with Zoom Phone Appliance and other things the last few quarters. I guess how do you think about chat functionality really outside of the video experience apps as well as kind of the broader customer experience and collaboration markets longer term presumes growth opportunity?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So it\u2019s a great question. So when it comes to Zoom Chat, right, we already had a building chat for many, many years. Some customers even standardized on Zoom Video, Zoom Phone and Zoom Chat. However, our approach is always look at everything from an end user, from a customer perspective, right. The order deployment is flat, it\u2019s wonderful. And the two best breed of service working together very well. Some customer, they wanted to stand out everything for Microsoft is okay. We also incorporated with Microsoft Teams. Some customer might be using other chat or standardize everything on our platform. Overall, I do not think that the customer, they would like to just one chatter solution in for everything. That\u2019s why I think the integration with our Meeting and the Phone, for sure, can help drive up the usage for our customers. Again, we are taking a very open-minded approach, no matter which solution, chatter solution they are using, we want to make sure we have a much better integration experience.\nJames Fish: Thanks.\nMatthew Caballero: Thank you. Next question is from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Hey, Eric and Kelly, good to see you. Thanks for taking my question. I want to dig into that 100,000 customer paying $100,000 that segment. So this was a big renewal quarter for you guys. So I just wanted to understand what sort of changes you have done to drive such success there. And what have you learned so that it can apply into Q2? And then a little bit color on what sort of growth in terms of \u2013 is that more users or cross-selling products, what you saw in that segment?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So first of all, take the last part first. It was really a combination of both. As we talked about some of the customers we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we saw expansion in terms of users, some transition from active hosts to enterprise licenses as well as additional products being deployed. And what we did \u2013 I think we talked about this last quarter. We made sure that especially our upmarket reps were aligned with the goal of renewing as many customers as possible this quarter. So we had a special bonus program in place for them to help them focus on renewals, and it really works, and that program is in place also for Q2. So we\u2019re looking forward to a strong renewals performance in Q2 as well.\nSiti Panigrahi: Okay. And then quick follow-up on that. It\u2019s very impressive to see that 90,000 plus user customer. So when you think of your addressable market when \u2013 and many in the enterprise and business is now looking to reopen, so how many such large customer you could potentially close?\nKelly Steckelberg: Well, I think the way that we look at it is there is a huge market opportunity already. And while we\u2019re super excited about deals like this, when you look at, for example, the Global 2000 the Fortune 100, there is still a relatively small penetration in terms of customers that are paying us more than $100,000. I think that in the Global 2000, we\u2019re still under like 15% that are paying us more than $100,000 annually. So that, to me, just represents opportunity that is ahead. And we have \u2013 our sales team is doing a great job of focusing on all of those opportunities. We have regular check-ins with them. And so there is \u2013 the potential is still massive.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. Thank you all.\nMatthew Caballero: Thank you, Siti. Our next question is from Will Power with Baird.\nWill Power: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Eric, earlier on, for a previous question, you spoke to some of the areas of strategic focus for you and the team this year. And I think right at at the top of that are near the top was the focus on turning Zoom into a broader platform, looking at those opportunities. So as you look out over the next 3 years and putting Zoom Phone aside, which is already having tremendous success, and Zoom Rooms, as you look at the SDK/API opportunity, which is rolling out, if you look at Zoom Events, what gets you most excited in terms of the bigger growth opportunity? And I guess within that, what are you thinking about today in terms of contact center? We hear all the UCaaS providers talk about the importance of contact center. You probably get this, right, every quarter. Where does that fit into the equation there, too?\nEric Yuan: Yes, Will, that\u2019s a wonderful question. I think there are so many things I\u2019m very excited every day. But when it comes to top priority and I will be excited for next 4 or 5 years, I would say number one thing is about Zoom Apps. So essentially, if you look at Zoom, right, Zoom more like when we do \u2013 Zoom is more like a business medication tools, right. During the pandemic crisis, a lot of consumers are using Zoom. Again, still for the business communication or maybe consumer communication, right, you look at Zoom interface it does not give you a lot of context, how do bringing those context, this is Zoom people-centric interface, down the road of well before the meeting is where you and I can play games together. You can approve my report. We have a great relationship with Starbucks and SurveyMonkey with all others. Essentially Zoom will become our operating system to focus on the people-centric interface. With the Zoom Apps, that\u2019s a huge opportunity. It\u2019s part of our overall marketplace strategy, including the Zoom SDK and other integrations. That\u2019s the most exciting opportunity. When it comes to contact center, this is part of our UC platform, right and that\u2019s the reason why I mention the Zoomtopia and scheduled September 13 and 14 and stay tuned. You will see something. Hopefully, we can do something around the contact center. Again, that\u2019s also the big market. Today, we do integrate very well with our greater partner, Five9, and also the Target, the Twilio, inContact and a whole [indiscernible]. Again, some of the new themes stay tuned at Zoomtopia.\nWill Power: Looking forward to that. Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Will.\nMatthew Caballero: Next question is from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey, guys. Thanks so much for taking the question. First, just on Zoom Phone if I could just go back \u2013 and congrats on the success, can you give any more color in terms of where you\u2019re seeing some of the accelerating growth both in terms of customer cohorts and upmarket versus small business? And then talk about some of the geographic mix where you\u2019re adding subs? And then just to go back to churn, particularly for the less than 10 employee base, maybe, Kelly, can you talk about how that trended in the quarter relative to expectations and then talk about what\u2019s embedded in your forecast for the second half of the year? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So in terms of Zoom Phone, we continue to see success across all segments of our business. As we\u2019ve said from the beginning, we \u2013 we\u2019re really excited about continued expansion into the upmarket. And we currently have 21 customers with more than 10,000 seats of Zoom Phone. So I think that shows that we really are seeing momentum in that upmarket and enterprise customer base. And so that\u2019s really exciting. And then international was the fastest-growing segment in terms of geographical locations for Zoom Phone last quarter, so, seeing really widespread momentum across that. And then in terms of the one through 10 cohort, we\u2019ve talked about it consistently being the most volatile cohort. We\u2019ve seen significant growth as it \u2013 a year or a little over a year ago, with 20% of our revenue growing to the mid-30s currently, and that has certainly been a segment that has been a lot more volatile than in the upmarket due to the fact that, first of all, most of them buy or a majority of them buy on monthly plans. So that\u2019s the flexibility that we give them, and we want people to stay with Zoom because they need it, but we have seen volatility in that segment. And we have modeled \u2013 when we came into the year, we modeled accelerated churn in that segment, and it\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s how we\u2019re continuing to think about it as we look for the rest of the year.\nEric Yuan: So Matt, just to quickly add a little bit of color to what Kelly said. If you look at the Phone deployment, today, I do not think any customer, no matter big enterprise, SME customers, they do not have Phone deployment. They already have something either on-prem or cloud. That\u2019s the reason why you can look at our growth. That means our solution is better, because if we are replacing any other solutions, it\u2019s not a brand new market, right? So, that\u2019s a replacement really helps us to drive up our growth. No matter big enterprise, on-premise deployment or SMB customers or even enterprise customers who deploy other cloud-based phone solution. They like our solution.\nMatthew Niknam: Got it. Thank you both for the color and congrats.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nMatthew Caballero: Our next question is from Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Thanks everybody. Kelly, I\u2019m going to ask you a fairly prosaic question about cash flow. Congrats by the way. $533 million in operating cash flow, great performance. So Kelly, I think we and a number of investors make some assumption about the gap between operating margins and operating cash flow margins. So given that Zoom, you obviously raised your full year operating margin guidance by a decent amount, you might see people apply that gap and raise their operating cash flow margin guidance or estimates as well. But I just wanted to ask you, as everybody has tempted to do that, whether there is anything happening in 2Q, 4Q that you would encourage us to keep in mind as we adjust our cash flow estimates. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So thank you for asking that, Karl. So first of all, Q1, due to the high level of renewals, and this being our biggest \u2013 was our biggest bookings quarter last year, right? And so big renewals quarter also means the largest billings quarter for the year. So that leads to also the opportunity for exceptional flections in the quarter. So bear that in mind. And this will be the largest billings and renewal quarter of the year, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And then as we continue to go through the year, you should go back to see how the relationship between free cash flow and operating margin existed kind of pre-pandemic. If you go all the way back to the sort of more normal operating period, that\u2019s what you should start to see as we move through the year. The only kind of exceptional consideration for the rest of the year is we do have eSBC purchases in Q2 and in Q4. So as that cash builds up as we go through Q1 and into Q2, and then there is the purchase and the same in the Q3 and Q4 okay.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. And then, Kelly, maybe as a follow-up, this dynamic of renewals being front-end loaded this fiscal year, you cautioned us to be careful about our RPO and DR sequentials. Is there anything else that, that kind of renewal, front-end loading, distorts or changes in terms of the seasonality and any other metric that you\u2019d encourage us to keep in mind?\nKelly Steckelberg: Well, the one we just talked about, with just billings and collections, right? That\u2019s really the impact.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay, terrific. Thank you very much.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, thank you.\nMatthew Caballero: Next question is from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yes. Thank you very much. So as kids go back to school, what kind of gross margin uplift are you thinking about is possible in the second half of the year? For example, you just hit 74%, are you thinking about like a couple of points of uplift in the second half? And following that, you have a long-term target of 80% for the gross margin. Talk about your expected time table to get there.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So currently, we \u2013 in our \u2013 in the guidance that we just gave, we have not modeled any impact or benefit from return-to-school as we are committed to supporting the needs of those schools as long as we\u2019re in a situation where it is it safe for students to return. If they were to all of a sudden go back, which I don\u2019t think is how would happen, you would see certainly a couple of points improvement in the gross margin. I think what will happen likely is it will be more measured than that. And little by little, you\u2019ll start to see the gross margin starting to creep up again. But in terms of the time line around that long-term margin target of 80%, we haven\u2019t set a time line as it remains still unknown how long that service is going to be needed by the school.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay, thank you.\nMatthew Caballero: Our next question is from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Hey, thanks a lot for taking the question. And I loved seem the demo. I\u2019m glad we didn\u2019t have to write our questions using that white board in the webinar. Due to struggle\u2026\nKelly Steckelberg: Hey, that\u2019s a great idea for next time. We will get you all.\nTyler Radke: So long as I don\u2019t go first. So Kelly, I wanted to ask you, obviously, really strong revenue growth this quarter, but I think most investors couldn\u2019t help but notice the magnitude of upside relative to your guidance was smaller than we\u2019ve seen in the last four quarters. You obviously called out better-than-expected churn, and customer adds look good relative to the Street. But I just wanted to understand, was there anything unusual that may be held back more robust revenue upside relative to your guide? Or is this just kind of the new normal that we should expect given you\u2019re starting to lapse some tough comps?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. I think we\u2019ve talked about this also in last quarter\u2019s call as well as we\u2019ve really started to round the year on some very difficult comps. And also, we\u2019re approaching almost $4 billion in revenue this year. We\u2019re becoming a very large company and I think are still very pleased with our guidance of 50% year-over-year growth. But yes, you\u2019re \u2013 this is going to be more than new normal, which is what I would expect of a company at this scale that these are more normalized growth rates, which you could expect.\nTyler Radke: Great. Thank you.\nMatthew Caballero: Our next question is from Matt Stotler with William Blair.\nMatt Stotler: Hi, guys. Good to see you, and thanks for taking the question. I\u2019ll just ask one and hop on a little bit late. Given we have our conference going on, so I\u2019m sure I one be asked already. But obviously, the Zoom Events platform was great to see. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been thinking about for a while, and we kind of saw the OnZoom release that this is going to be a part of this going forward. Let me just double-click on how meaningful the opportunity with Zoom Events could be. Obviously, it makes a lot of fundamental sense, and a lot of companies have been hosting their events on Zoom. But as you think about what that broad opportunity could look like, whether there is numbers around that or just qualitative, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Eric, do you want to talk about the vision?\nEric Yuan: Sure. Absolutely. So Matt, so the reason why we build Zoom Events is, first of all, we really received a lot of feedback from the customer side. They already hosted lots of Zoom webinars. Now we want to do more, especially the pre-events and post-events and how to run everything virtually online, like to take a Zoomtopia, for example, from the planning the Zoom project and all the way to you finish everything, make sure everything you can count on one platform, that\u2019s the opportunity coming from, right? However, I think given the last pandemic crisis, you feel like a little bit more pressure for us how to quickly satisfy the customer needs, but we do already have a lot of installed base for Zoom video webinar. I think it\u2019s more like a natural migration, right, to the Zoom Events platform. Also as new revenue opportunities, not only driven from corporate events but also later this year for the consumer prosumer events, right? As I mentioned earlier, right, you really can host a very meaningful event, and you can sell tickets to your participant. We have a tight integration with the payment and provider as well. That\u2019s the reason why it could be another revenue driver on both corporate side and also on consumer side.\nMatt Stotler: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Matt.\nMatthew Caballero: Next question is from Matt VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatt VanVliet: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Appreciate it. I guess thinking about the channel question a little bit differently, curious how much of an opportunity is that for the video only side or at least the landing spot for the video side. Or is that primarily Zoom Phone right now driving most of the channel business?\nKelly Steckelberg: No. Early on, we saw great success as selling meetings through direct, and we\u2019ve continued to expand our channel relationships across both Meetings and Phone. But it\u2019s \u2013 it depends on where the customer is themselves, right? We really want to meet them and provide them the opportunity to have access to our sales organization in whatever manner works for them best. So we do obviously sell both Meetings and Phone. A larger percentage of our Zoom Phone business comes through the channel. I think that\u2019s just based on historically how organizations have typically bought. But again, it\u2019s really up to the customer. We want to meet them wherever they go most comfortably.\nMatt VanVliet: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Matt.\nMatthew Caballero: Our next question is from Taz Koujalgi with Guggenheim.\nTaz Koujalgi: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have question on Zoom Phone. You\u2019ve been selling through channel partners and direct as well. I had a question about the impact of margins when you sell through the channel versus selling directly because I\u2019ve heard that there is a lot of space and residues you repeat to the channel partners when you sell through them. So can you talk about the head to margins for Zoom Phone when you sell a deal directly versus selling through a channel partner?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. We certainly have a channel program that we think is attractive and competitive in the market. But I will say we thought a very long time about setting those rates and where they are and allowing them to having a differentiated product. So the way that we see it is, while there is some impact to the overall margin when there is a channel partner involved, it\u2019s really about the broader opportunity to continue to take market share and grow as quickly as possible. And again, back to the last question, we really want our customers to be able to buy in the way that feels the most comfortable to them. So while there is some impact to margin, overall, we think that for the long-term, it\u2019s absolutely sustainable, and it\u2019s really the best approach as we continue to focus on growing top line.\nTaz Koujalgi: And just one more housekeeping question. You didn\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you gave us a number of Zoom Phone customers this quarter. I think last quarter was 11,000. Maybe I missed it, but can you comment on the number of Zoom Phone customers this quarter?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. We did not disclose that. That\u2019s one of the things that we\u2019re going to do on a milestone basis. And the next milestone where we are likely to disclose it will be Analyst Day at Zoomtopia in September.\nTaz Koujalgi: Thanks, guys. Thank you very much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nMatthew Caballero: Our next question is from Jonathan Kees with Summit Insights Group.\nJonathan Kees: Great. Hey, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the quarter. I just wanted to double-click on, Eric, your comments earlier about Phones and that you\u2019re winning more and more. It sounds like from other cloud providers. I guess is that becoming a bigger part of the wins for Phone? Do you see that as indeed a \u2013 the stronger growth trajectory versus replacing the legacy premise phones business? And as well as if you can provide any details in terms of like any bake-offs between you and the other phones providers, that would be great. I know you may be hesitant, but more detail, the better. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Sure. I think first of all, you look at only the 2 years, right? Since we launched Zoom Phone, right, last quarter, it\u2019s 1 million paid seats. As Graeme shared, on his live session is already 125 million, right. It does tell us something, right. It works, right. So today, you look at a lot of enterprise customers very rapidly deployed on-prem solutions, that\u2019s a huge opportunity for every \u2013 the cloud business service provider, including Zoom. So \u2013 and the Zoom \u2013 I think the card business, phone business is big. That market itself accommodated [indiscernible] right. I think we are a part of that. And also you look at other businesses who already deployed cloud-based phone solutions. Our growth is coming from replacing those surgeons with this year a lot of deals, right. And no matter which window, we do see the customer, the job \u2013 the other cloud-based phone solutions switching to us. There are multiple reasons. First of all, we already built their trust. Certainly, if you look at our solution is modern interface, much better integration in the video because, ultimately, we think voice and video are same thing. Those two can be converged into one experience. Otherwise, you deploy several solution for phones, several solution for video. But any of the perspective, it\u2019s not consistent. There no work. Zoom is much better positioned than any other windows on that front. And also, you look at our other functionalities, Zoom Events, Apps, and also the Webinars, Zoom Rooms, a lot of other things, overall customer like our experience, right. That\u2019s the reason why we look at an opportunity, could it come from enterprise, on-prem deployment or the cloud-based opportunities from other Zoom service products. We do see growth coming from almost everywhere. But again, it\u2019s too early to tell. It\u2019s only 2 years. Maybe next 2 years, I can share more with some detailed numbers, so...\nJonathan Kees: Thank you, Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nMatthew Caballero: Our next question is from [indiscernible].\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nMatthew Caballero: We can\u2019t hear your line.\nUnidentified Analyst: I know I said my question was asked. Thank you. Congratulations.\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: My answer is very straightforward. Thank you.\nMatthew Caballero: And we have our next question is from Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: Hey, Eric, Kelly and Tom, thanks so much for taking my questions. It\u2019s nice to see continued momentum in the business. I wanted to ask a little bit of a philosophical question, which is around hybrid work, right? I mean I think it\u2019s consensus at this point that the workplace of the future is going to be hybrid, but you had this really enlightening survey a couple of months ago of 1,500 Zoomers of what that means. And everyone is very sharply divided on what hybrid work is, whether that\u2019s home as the primary or the office as the primary, something in between. So a simple kind of question. What does hybrid work mean when you think about that? And is there a particular model [Technical Difficulty] of hybrid work that you think Zoom [Technical Difficulty]?\nEric Yuan: Sorry, Rishi, a little bit broken. But anyway, so to answer to your questions, so I happen to read an article today from Bloomberg, right? In May, right, I think they did a survey, right, the 1,000 U.S. adults, right, and 39% of responding \u2013 they mention they need flexibility. If you look at the millennials or the Generation Z, the number increases to the 49%, right? So meaning when you give the flexibility to those employees, otherwise, you are going to lose the clients. So when it comes hybrid, first of all, that will become mainstream. However, different businesses, they might have a different way to manage a hybrid work. Like 2 days in the office or 3 days in the office, it\u2019s different, right. And also they might have one week in office, another week at home also it could be different. But overall, the definition of the hybrid work is about flexibility, to give employee flexibility.\nMatthew Caballero: Alright. Thank you, Rishi. Okay. We have time for one more question. And that last question is from Tom Roderick with Stifel.\nTom Roderick: Okay, great. Thanks management for the question. Hi, Eric, hi, Kelly, good to see you. Thinking back to a year ago on your first quarter call last year and with all the great success, you still spent a fair bit of time on that call kind of walking us all through the big plans on how to beef up security and solve for a lot of the emerging concerns that were coming with all of this jump in activity. I think it\u2019s pretty telling to your success on that front that we haven\u2019t utter the word security once on this call, I think, but I also recognize the threat vectors aren\u2019t going away here. Can you just give us an update, Eric, to your thoughts on what you need to do to stay ahead of the security plan? You\u2019ve reached end-to-end encryption. Your 90-day plan was a success. But what\u2019s next? How do you stay ahead of it?\nEric Yuan: Yes. This is a great question. Before I talk about next, maybe I\u2019ll take a step back to share what had happened, right? Because Zoom was built so for enterprise customers. We never start the K-12 schools or consumers, consumers who are going to use Zoom. We never thought about that pandemic crisis. That\u2019s \u2013 by and large, most of the challenge coming from that. However, I think we really take that seriously, right? We doubled \u2013 more than doubled, I mean, the size of a company. The reason why we want to add more resource on privacy security, I can tell you, we have almost 200 people working for the privacy and security now at Zoom, but we\u2019re really doubling down on that. That\u2019s one. But two is we are so grateful to our customers. The reason why we earn their trust back. They understand what [indiscernible], and that\u2019s why a lot of people joined our weekly webinar last May and April, 90 days, and I\u2019m still running the monthly secured webinar, right? We share everything open transparent. Now that\u2019s a second thing. Third thing I think we \u2013 security and privacy is not only a feature. It\u2019s out of core DNA in terms of process and the functionality, features, road map, innovation areas, right? This is our, I think, a new approach. I\u2019ve also \u2013 we shared everything with our customers. So, in terms of specific features or enhancement, a lot of smaller things, right. Like recently, we added new dedications. In particular, we added a lot of Zoom apps. In the Zoom apps, you might want to and understand your meeting the content without the [indiscernible] customers was going on, that\u2019s not as good from a security perspective, right? A lot of smaller innovations on that front. So again, actually, we do spend a lot of time resource on that. That is still a part of our overall innovation for supporting the privacy and security is extremely important for our future growth.\nTom Roderick: Great update. Thank you, Eric.\nEric Yuan: By the way, Tom, we recently look at RSA Security Conference. They are using Zoom as well, right? We have a lot of security companies who standardize on Zoom platform. It does help \u2013 we take security very, very seriously.\nTom Roderick: Okay, thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nMatthew Caballero: And that was the last question we have time for today. Thank you, everyone, and thank you for joining us.\nEric Yuan: Thank you all. So I really appreciate it. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Bye, everybody. Thank you.",

I am the Head of Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms and I am excited to be joining the call today from, you guessed it, my Zoom Phone Appliance. Our new Zoom Phone Appliances allow our customers to take advantage of the powerful audio and video capabilities of Zoom and they are a great solution for touchdown spaces, huddle rooms and executive offices alike. We also can't wait to see some of the vertical applications that our customers come up with for this new category as well. And while I am here, I have got some exciting news to share. I think I will use the whiteboarding feature of this device. So at the end of December, we announced reaching 1 million seats of Zoom Phones sold. Well, that momentum continues and I am excited to announce that we have now surpassed 1.5 million seats of Zoom Phones sold as of the end of September. It's been absolutely amazing to see the growth continue to accelerate. Thank you for allowing me to join you today. And now, I will turn it over to Kelly."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Graeme and thanks to you and your team for your hard work and for that amazing accomplishments. Hello, everybody. Our impressive growth story continued in Q1. As you can see, we continued to win awards and third-party recognition for our strong security focus, empowering company culture and lasting impact on society. Thank you to all of our amazing customers and employees who made these accolades possible. In Q1, the year-over-year growth of total revenue remained strong at 191%, reaching $956 million. The top line results exceeded the high end of our guidance of $905 million due to strong sales and marketing execution, led by our direct and channel businesses as well as lower than expected churn. Demand was widespread across products, industry verticals, geographies, new logos and customer cohorts. It's also worth noting that our fiscal 2020 results have shifted our renewal seasonality, which is now more weighted towards the beginning of the year. To illustrate, we saw approximately 4x more deals up for renewal in Q1 of FY \u201822 as compared to Q1 of last year. Our renewals, sales and online marketing teams really outperformed its differing renewals and the success is a testament to their hard work and our products strong and lasting value proposition. The year-over-year growth in revenue for the quarter was driven by a healthy mix between new and existing customers, where new customers accounted for approximately 57% of the incremental revenue and existing customers accounted for 43% of the incremental revenue. This trend towards existing customers was expected considering the tremendous growth in our base last year. Let's take a look at the key customer metrics for the quarter. We saw growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 1,999 customers generating more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. We exited the quarter with approximately 497,000 customers, with more than 10 employees, adding approximately 30,000 customers during the quarter. In Q1, customers with more than 10 employees represented approximately 63% of revenue. We also continue to benefit from solid growth in our segment of customers with 10 or fewer employees. In Q1, customers with 10 or fewer employees represented approximately 37% of revenue, up from 30% in Q1 last year and stable quarter-over-quarter. Our net dollar expansion rate for customers with more than 10 employees exceeded 130% for the 12th consecutive quarter as customers acquired more Zoom Meetings, Rooms, Webinars and Phone products. For this customer subset, we expect the net dollar expansion rate to remain above 130% for the next few quarters. For customers with 10 or fewer employees, which are not included in its net dollar expansion metric, we expect that cohort to be lower than FY \u201821 as more volatile \u2013 and more volatile as economies continue to reopen. Both domestic and international markets had strong growth during the quarter. Our Americas revenue grew 159% year-over-year. Our combined APAC and EMEA revenue grew 288% year-over-year to be approximately 34% of revenue, up from 25% a year ago. In recent quarters, we made significant investments in our international teams, which have already begun to pay dividends. The global opportunity remains large and we will continue to empower our team to capitalize on it. Now, turning to profitability. The increase in demand and strong execution drove net income profitability from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspective. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, charitable donation of common stock, acquisition-related expenses and net litigation expenses. Non-GAAP gross margin in the first quarter was 73.9% compared to 69.4% in Q1 last year and 71.3% in Q4. The sequential improvement in gross margin is mainly due to optimization of public cloud resources. We expect gross margin to remain relatively stable in the low 70s as long as we continue to support free K-12 education. Research and development expense grew by 97% year-over-year to approximately $41 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense was approximately 4.3%, which is lower than in Q1 of last year, mainly due to the strong top line growth. However, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, expenses grew by 33%, demonstrating our commitment to building out our engineering teams globally and maintaining best-in-class product and innovation. Sales and marketing expense grew by 84% year-over-year to $191 million. This reflects an additional $87 million over last year primarily due to investments in hiring to drive future growth. Sales and marketing expense was approximately 20% of total revenue, a decrease from Q1 of last year, mainly due to strong top line growth. We plan to continue to invest in adding global sales capacity and brand and product marketing programs in order to capitalize in our growing leadership position and growth initiatives. G&A expense in the quarter grew by 51% to $73 million as we continue to scale these functions and invest in systems, automation and compliance to meet our new scale. G&A expense was approximately 7.7% of total revenue, a decrease from Q1 of last year. Revenue upside in the quarter carried through to the bottom line, with non-GAAP operating income of $401 million, exceeding our guidance. This translates to a 41.9% non-GAAP operating margin for Q1, a large improvement from 16.6% in Q1 last year and a slight improvement from 40.9% in Q4. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1, was $1.32 on approximately 305 million non-GAAP weighted average shares outstanding. This result is $0.35 above the high-end of our guidance and $1.12 above Q1 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet, deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.1 billion, up 98% year-over-year from $552 million. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $2.1 billion, up 94% year-over-year from $1.1 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 72% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, consistent with the level of this metric last year. It's important to remember that deferred revenue and RPO trends are not reliable predictors of future revenue growth due to the large percent of monthly billings in our customer base. In addition, the timing of our renewals has increasingly shifted to the beginning of the fiscal year, with Q1 now representing our largest renewal quarter. We expect sequential increases in deferred revenue and RPO in each of the remaining quarters be lower as our available population of annual renewals is smaller. We ended the quarter with approximately $4.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had exceptional operating cash flow in the quarter of $533 million, up from $259 million in Q1 of last year. Free cash flow was $454 million, up from $252 million in Q1 of last year. The increase is primarily attributable to strong sales execution and collections. Looking at the rest of the fiscal year, we expect to increase our capital expenditures related to ongoing datacenter expansion to support our growth outlook. We also expect a legal settlement, which will be disclosed in our 10-Q to be a cash outflow in late FY \u201822. Now, turning to guidance. We are pleased to raise our outlook for Q2 FY \u201822 and the full fiscal year. Please note that the impact and extent of the global pandemic still remain largely unknown. Our outlook is based on our current assessment of the business environment as well as our own research and conversations with customers. For the second quarter of FY \u201822, we expect revenue to be in the range of $985 million to $990 million. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $355 million to $360 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.14 to $1.15 based on approximately 311 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY \u201822, we expect revenue to be in the range of $3.975 billion to $3.99 billion, which would represent approximately 50% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $1.425 billion to $1.44 billion, which would represent approximately 45% to 46% year-over-year growth. Our outlook for the non-GAAP earnings per share is $4.56 to $4.61 based on approximately 311 million shares outstanding. Before concluding, I am happy to highlight that we recently launched our ESG website, which can be found on our Investor Relations and corporate website. We also recently published our Social Impact report, which can be found on our Zoom Cares website. Giving back to the community has always been a key tenant of what we do at Zoom. We look forward to updating our investors as we continue along our ESG journey. As always, Zoom is grateful to be a driving force, enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless and secure communications platform. Thank you, the entire team, our customers, our community and our investors. If you have not yet enabled your video, please do so now for the interactive portion of this meeting. Matt, please queue up our first question. So, we are really excited about the momentum of Zoom Phone and it was great to have Graeme as a guest star today on our call. And what I think you are seeing and what you are gathering, Ittai, is that there is definitely increased momentum happening there. So, it took us seven quarters to get to that $1 million \u2013 I mean that 1 million seats level. And then, yes, that was in December. So, it's taken us about 5 months to add an additional 500,000 seats to that number. So, it doesn't happen exactly. Equally, each of those months, right, as you can imagine, there are trends at the end of the quarter, but we absolutely are seeing an acceleration in the momentum there and we are very excited about it. Yes. So absolutely, our salespeople take the opportunity when there is a renewal to talk about cross-selling and up-selling. In terms of the specific packages themselves, we aren't going to disclose the actual breakout of that, but a lot of what you saw disclosed in the revenue coming from new customers is the opportunity they saw to up-sell either Zoom Phone or Webinars or Rooms as people are thinking about going back into the office spaces again. Hi, Dan. So, we were really pleased. And as I said, great thanks to all of our renewals and sales and online marketing teams for their great work done in Q1 as we had a better-than-expected result in terms of not only retaining customers, but also up-selling them during Q1, especially in that cohort of customers with greater than 10 employees. So, that's really exciting to see as we expect that momentum to continue as we carry through the year. We see significant renewals also coming up in Q2 as well. In terms of the customer segment with fewer than 10 employees, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are still expecting that to be more volatile as that's a segment that we have seen over the last 15 months has reacted more quickly to the openings and potential closings of markets around the globe. So first of all, we continue to see tremendous opportunity. We were thrilled with the performance in the upmarket in Q1. As Eric just talked about, we had our largest deal to-date and we had some amazing customer wins. And so we are continuing to invest in our direct and our channel sales organizations, especially. And we have seen pretty consistent sales productivity. It's going back to levels that are more reflective of pre-pandemic, but at an elevated level from there given the benefit we have of the global brand awareness, our expanded portfolio of products. And so we are really excited about the future, especially in that upmarket and international as well. As you heard, we are 34% of revenue and then, of course, we look to Zoom Phone and the continuing momentum that we are seeing there. Thank you, Alex. I think that it actually depends on when it is in the quarter in terms of the renewals. So think about, especially Q1 has this very weird timing from last year, where all of those \u2013 like the real dramatic change in the business happened on March 15, so literally halfway through the business. So what you \u2013 we don't have the full benefit of all of those renewals yet in this quarter. You are going to see it come into next quarter. And unfortunately, Q1 is always going to have that kind of funny phenomenon, because most people co-term with their original date, which was sometime after March 15 in last year. Thank you, Sterling. So, in terms of the gross margin, it was really was more around continuing to optimize with our public cloud partners. As we have scaled up, we have had the opportunity to work with them on better pricing packages. And that's really what that's attributed to rather than seeing a dramatic shift yet in students going back to school. As we have talked about before, there is a pretty significant impact on the gross margin due to the free K-12. And what we expect is that is going to do what you say, that was going to come in over time. If all of a sudden, they were to go back-to-school, you would see a pretty dramatic step function improvement in the gross margin, but I expect that you are going to see that probably happen starting in the fall as more and more students are able to safely go back to the school. And then in terms of international expansion, specifically around the channel, this is a really great question. We had a discussion about that in the last couple of weeks. So, the team has done a really good job in focusing on our U.S. channel strategy, especially around Zoom Phone and building out our master agent program and we are now working on building that out internationally. It's probably guessing, but we are probably where we were in the U.S. a year ago or so. So, it's probably about a year behind in terms of our international channel strategy. So, it's great that there is opportunity ahead and Laura Padilla and her team are working on that now. Happy early birthday to you too, James. It's your birthday. Yes. So first of all, take the last part first. It was really a combination of both. As we talked about some of the customers we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we saw expansion in terms of users, some transition from active hosts to enterprise licenses as well as additional products being deployed. And what we did \u2013 I think we talked about this last quarter. We made sure that especially our upmarket reps were aligned with the goal of renewing as many customers as possible this quarter. So we had a special bonus program in place for them to help them focus on renewals, and it really works, and that program is in place also for Q2. So we're looking forward to a strong renewals performance in Q2 as well. Well, I think the way that we look at it is there is a huge market opportunity already. And while we're super excited about deals like this, when you look at, for example, the Global 2000 the Fortune 100, there is still a relatively small penetration in terms of customers that are paying us more than $100,000. I think that in the Global 2000, we're still under like 15% that are paying us more than $100,000 annually. So that, to me, just represents opportunity that is ahead. And we have \u2013 our sales team is doing a great job of focusing on all of those opportunities. We have regular check-ins with them. And so there is \u2013 the potential is still massive. So in terms of Zoom Phone, we continue to see success across all segments of our business. As we've said from the beginning, we \u2013 we're really excited about continued expansion into the upmarket. And we currently have 21 customers with more than 10,000 seats of Zoom Phone. So I think that shows that we really are seeing momentum in that upmarket and enterprise customer base. And so that's really exciting. And then international was the fastest-growing segment in terms of geographical locations for Zoom Phone last quarter, so, seeing really widespread momentum across that. And then in terms of the one through 10 cohort, we've talked about it consistently being the most volatile cohort. We've seen significant growth as it \u2013 a year or a little over a year ago, with 20% of our revenue growing to the mid-30s currently, and that has certainly been a segment that has been a lot more volatile than in the upmarket due to the fact that, first of all, most of them buy or a majority of them buy on monthly plans. So that's the flexibility that we give them, and we want people to stay with Zoom because they need it, but we have seen volatility in that segment. And we have modeled \u2013 when we came into the year, we modeled accelerated churn in that segment, and it's \u2013 that's how we're continuing to think about it as we look for the rest of the year. Yes. So thank you for asking that, Karl. So first of all, Q1, due to the high level of renewals, and this being our biggest \u2013 was our biggest bookings quarter last year, right? And so big renewals quarter also means the largest billings quarter for the year. So that leads to also the opportunity for exceptional flections in the quarter. So bear that in mind. And this will be the largest billings and renewal quarter of the year, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks. And then as we continue to go through the year, you should go back to see how the relationship between free cash flow and operating margin existed kind of pre-pandemic. If you go all the way back to the sort of more normal operating period, that's what you should start to see as we move through the year. The only kind of exceptional consideration for the rest of the year is we do have eSBC purchases in Q2 and in Q4. So as that cash builds up as we go through Q1 and into Q2, and then there is the purchase and the same in the Q3 and Q4 okay. Well, the one we just talked about, with just billings and collections, right? That's really the impact. Yes, thank you. Yes. So currently, we \u2013 in our \u2013 in the guidance that we just gave, we have not modeled any impact or benefit from return-to-school as we are committed to supporting the needs of those schools as long as we're in a situation where it is it safe for students to return. If they were to all of a sudden go back, which I don't think is how would happen, you would see certainly a couple of points improvement in the gross margin. I think what will happen likely is it will be more measured than that. And little by little, you'll start to see the gross margin starting to creep up again. But in terms of the time line around that long-term margin target of 80%, we haven't set a time line as it remains still unknown how long that service is going to be needed by the school. Hey, that's a great idea for next time. We will get you all. Yes. I think we've talked about this also in last quarter's call as well as we've really started to round the year on some very difficult comps. And also, we're approaching almost $4 billion in revenue this year. We're becoming a very large company and I think are still very pleased with our guidance of 50% year-over-year growth. But yes, you're \u2013 this is going to be more than new normal, which is what I would expect of a company at this scale that these are more normalized growth rates, which you could expect. Eric, do you want to talk about the vision? No. Early on, we saw great success as selling meetings through direct, and we've continued to expand our channel relationships across both Meetings and Phone. But it's \u2013 it depends on where the customer is themselves, right? We really want to meet them and provide them the opportunity to have access to our sales organization in whatever manner works for them best. So we do obviously sell both Meetings and Phone. A larger percentage of our Zoom Phone business comes through the channel. I think that's just based on historically how organizations have typically bought. But again, it's really up to the customer. We want to meet them wherever they go most comfortably. Yes. We certainly have a channel program that we think is attractive and competitive in the market. But I will say we thought a very long time about setting those rates and where they are and allowing them to having a differentiated product. So the way that we see it is, while there is some impact to the overall margin when there is a channel partner involved, it's really about the broader opportunity to continue to take market share and grow as quickly as possible. And again, back to the last question, we really want our customers to be able to buy in the way that feels the most comfortable to them. So while there is some impact to margin, overall, we think that for the long-term, it's absolutely sustainable, and it's really the best approach as we continue to focus on growing top line. Yes. We did not disclose that. That's one of the things that we're going to do on a milestone basis. And the next milestone where we are likely to disclose it will be Analyst Day at Zoomtopia in September. Okay. Thank you. Bye, everybody. Thank you."

            "name": "Eric Yuan",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom and welcome everyone joining us on today's webinar. I want to start by thanking our customers for their commitment to and trust in Zoom, which drove a strong start to our fiscal year with revenue growing 191% year-over-year as well as strong profitability and free cash flow. I also want to recognize our more than 5,000 employees. Their dedication to our customers' happiness is an incredible advantage and creates a positive feedback loop that keeps our customers coming back and our employees eager to meet their diverse needs. Our ability to help our customers by increasing their productivity, promoting their employees' happiness and connections to each other and reducing their travel-related carbon footprint gives our work great meaning and makes Zoom a great place to work. Our company culture is strong and we are more motivated than ever. Let me also thank all of you, our investors, for your trust and support. So we are very grateful to our employees, our customers, partners and our investors. Thank you. As parts of the world reopened, a few things are clear. First, many customers I talk to are looking to create hybrid solutions as they seek to cautiously reopen some offices; and second, each industry, company and individual varies in their optimal working model. Zoom is here to help each customer calibrate their future working model in their own way. Many companies are redesigning the workplace to enhance the hybrid work experience. So, to meet this need, we announced Zoom Rooms features such as smart gallery, which puts in-room and remote participants in equal footing, virtual receptionist, participant counting, and environmental sensors. We have begun to deliver on our platform strategy. In February, we launched our video SDK. In April, we announced our $100 million Zoom Apps Fund to further build our app ecosystem. Zoom Apps is designed to enhance users \u2013 to enable users to bring their favorite apps directly into the Zoom experience in a way that inspires collaboration, boosts the efficiency, creates healthier habits and generates much more fun. We will also launch Zoom Events, our events platform, which will be focused on our enterprise customers and support an array of virtual event use cases. In a recent study we conducted, 80% of U.S. respondents agreed that all interactions will continue to have a virtual element post-pandemic, and that figure was even higher in many of the other markets we are serving. The hybrid model is here to stay and Zoom Events will be an excellent solution for our customers who are looking to create and host the company events with a versatile and powerful solution. We are very happy to announce that we closed our largest deal ever in terms of ARR, with a leading global financial services firm that selected Zoom Meetings to deploy for over 90,000 hosts. That is only one of the large deals we closed this quarter. Let me recognize three more industry-leading companies that have increased their commitment to Zoom. First, I want to thank Kimberly-Clark, whose trusted brands are an indispensable part of life for people in more than 175 countries, for expanding the relationship with Zoom by adding approximately 25,000 Zoom Phone licenses. As an existing Zoom Meetings and Video Webinar customer, Kimberly-Clark saw the same reliability, value and innovation in Zoom Phone. I also wanted to recognize our partner, British Telecom for advocating for Zoom in the decision-making process at Kimberly-Clark. Next, thank you, Target Corporation, which serves guests at more than 1,900 stores and online at Target.com with the mission to help families discover the joy of everyday life for their commitment to Zoom. We are very excited to help Target take their communications initiatives to the next level by expanding their Zoom platform solution while unifying their internal and external communications on our technology. As a longstanding Zoom Meetings customer, we truly appreciate their trust and faith in Zoom as a platform and partner. And finally, I want to thank Denso, Japan's largest and the world's second largest automotive parts company, and a leading company in the Toyota Group. They first joined the Zoom family last year, but last quarter, they decided to significantly expand their usage of Zoom Meetings and Zoom Video Webinars for internal and external communications. Zoom now connects 47,000 employees across offices, factories and homes. Denso said the introduction of Zoom has contributed greatly to our ability to create a work environment that drives faster decision-making. Kimberly-Clark, Target and Denso, thank you. Love you. We are off to a great start in fiscal 2022. I look forward to updating you on our hybrid workspace and a platform evolution throughout the year and at Zoomtopia, which will be held on September 13 and 14 in a virtual format. Before handing it over to Kelly, I want to share a quick update. As you know, demand for Zoom Phone has been amazing and I am very excited to announce our new device category, the Zoom Phone Appliance. I have invited Graeme to tell you more. Thank you. Ittai, just quickly to add on to what Kelly said, when it comes to Zoom Phone growth, what's fascinating is that is about our product innovation, reliability, security, availability, all the very good features. There are so many customers, no matter which solution they deployed before either on-prem or other cloud-based home solutions, they all like Zoom solutions. Thank you. Thank you, Dan. Yes. Alex, that's a great question. First of all, I want to say I am a fan of you, because you will regularly update some kind of \u2013 daily update about what's going on, on SaaS market. Very well done, Alex. Thank you. I think when it comes to Zoom Rooms, that's a huge opportunity, in particular, for every business when they are reopening their office, because the way to setup Zoom Rooms or the comp rooms are very different. They like, as I mentioned earlier, right, we have a smarter gallery view, which puts Zoom participants and remote participants on equal footing. That kind of experience I did not see requested before. But in the future, more and more like that, a lot of innovation are on the Zoom Rooms. I would say this is probably the third revenue driver in terms of usage and lots of new use cases. Also, what's more important is that when it comes to the comp room or Zoom Room setup, customers like consistent experience meaning when they are back at home, because the future is about a hybrid. When they are working from home, they also want to have a consistent experience. That's another reason why a customer not only do they deploy the desktop Zoom Meeting or Webinar or Zoom, but also they like the comp room experience as well. So that's another driver for our customers to standardize on Zoom platform, for Meetings, for Webinar or the Phone, again, a lot of innovation in the pipeline for the Zoom Rooms. Thank you, Alex. Yes. So Patrick, yes, drive safely. Yes... Thank you. I think I want to share with you my personal priority I would share with the company key initiatives, right. So I share with our team when we started the year, for me, I think three top priorities for me as the CEO, right. Number one is really make sure focus on our company culture, to maintain the company culture, evolve our company culture because you have so many new employees coming on board remotely. Number two is double down my time on the platform, the platform, platform, right. It's not only [indiscernible] video in the business, but also the overall platform. Last but not the least, about some of the very big large and strategic deals, that's more like my personal part. If you look at it Zoom from a strategy perspective, first of all, I think how to make sure support all those businesses reopen and reenter their offices. That's very, very important. That's why you see a lot of innovations are around that angle, right, either the conference room or the phone, in building the chat or meetings, that's number one the initiatives. Number two is really about the international market expansion. There is a huge opportunity. From 25% to more than 30%, I think we do see a lot of opportunities from other, EMEA, APAC, Japan, a lot of opportunities, right. We got to invest more. That's the second thing. Last but not least is overall how to make sure with our platform strategy works, how to double down our platform driven by our Zoom Events, Zoom Apps and UC platform and also our HD capabilities, I think that essentially that will set us up for the future growth if we can invest more to our platform. Thank you, Patrick. Also, Sterling, I would like to add a little bit more, if you look at Q1 or Q2 last fiscal year in terms of revenue growth driven by a lot of online buyers like for Zoom consumer SMB business. Starting Q1, we do see \u2013 driven by large customers, enterprise customers, right, also the Zoom Phone as well, we closed our largest ever deal, right? This is a very good thing. I think this is \u2013 that's a future trend, right, driven by our business customers. Yes. So Zoom has two parts. One is about the corporate events. Another one is about consumer or consumer events. I think our plan is to launch our corporate events first. Essentially, we have so many webinar customers. They are looking for a lot of new innovations. Essentially, they can't run their annual user conference everything online. That's why we doubled down our Events platform. I think we are going to focus on the corporate events first. And then later this year, we also want to probably get our consumer events. Essentially, you have time, you have a Zoom Meeting host account, you can sell tickets, you can teach anything online. That's more like the opportunity for the second half of this year. Thank you, Sterling. I think, first of all, I think as Kelly mentioned earlier, right, not only driven by our direct business team. When it comes to Zoom Phone, by and large, a lot of our customers we already built a brilliant relationship with those carriers or partners or master agent, we are already doubling down on that, right. This is essentially become more and more important into our Zoom Phone growth. That's our strategy. And inside of that, every time when we work together with our channel partners or carriers, take British Telecom, for example, when we are working together with our potential prospects, after they valued our Zoom service, it's just they not only realized this service works so well, but also look at \u2013 we shared the roadmap with them. They said, wow. That's amazing because compared with any other solutions, I mean in other cloud-based phone solutions, really like our roadmap, really like the usability and integration with the video meetings, webinars and also the reliability plus security. And that's the reason why we are winning, right, British Telecom, they allocate for Zoom at Kimberly-Clark. This is a huge deployment. I think overall, we see more and more deals like that. It's particular in customers to test our solutions. We have high confidence Zoom Phone is much more innovative than any other solutions for them. Yes. So it's a great question. So when it comes to Zoom Chat, right, we already had a building chat for many, many years. Some customers even standardized on Zoom Video, Zoom Phone and Zoom Chat. However, our approach is always look at everything from an end user, from a customer perspective, right. The order deployment is flat, it's wonderful. And the two best breed of service working together very well. Some customer, they wanted to stand out everything for Microsoft is okay. We also incorporated with Microsoft Teams. Some customer might be using other chat or standardize everything on our platform. Overall, I do not think that the customer, they would like to just one chatter solution in for everything. That's why I think the integration with our Meeting and the Phone, for sure, can help drive up the usage for our customers. Again, we are taking a very open-minded approach, no matter which solution, chatter solution they are using, we want to make sure we have a much better integration experience. Yes, Will, that's a wonderful question. I think there are so many things I'm very excited every day. But when it comes to top priority and I will be excited for next 4 or 5 years, I would say number one thing is about Zoom Apps. So essentially, if you look at Zoom, right, Zoom more like when we do \u2013 Zoom is more like a business medication tools, right. During the pandemic crisis, a lot of consumers are using Zoom. Again, still for the business communication or maybe consumer communication, right, you look at Zoom interface it does not give you a lot of context, how do bringing those context, this is Zoom people-centric interface, down the road of well before the meeting is where you and I can play games together. You can approve my report. We have a great relationship with Starbucks and SurveyMonkey with all others. Essentially Zoom will become our operating system to focus on the people-centric interface. With the Zoom Apps, that's a huge opportunity. It's part of our overall marketplace strategy, including the Zoom SDK and other integrations. That's the most exciting opportunity. When it comes to contact center, this is part of our UC platform, right and that's the reason why I mention the Zoomtopia and scheduled September 13 and 14 and stay tuned. You will see something. Hopefully, we can do something around the contact center. Again, that's also the big market. Today, we do integrate very well with our greater partner, Five9, and also the Target, the Twilio, inContact and a whole [indiscernible]. Again, some of the new themes stay tuned at Zoomtopia. Thank you, Will. So Matt, just to quickly add a little bit of color to what Kelly said. If you look at the Phone deployment, today, I do not think any customer, no matter big enterprise, SME customers, they do not have Phone deployment. They already have something either on-prem or cloud. That's the reason why you can look at our growth. That means our solution is better, because if we are replacing any other solutions, it's not a brand new market, right? So, that's a replacement really helps us to drive up our growth. No matter big enterprise, on-premise deployment or SMB customers or even enterprise customers who deploy other cloud-based phone solution. They like our solution. Thank you. Sure. Absolutely. So Matt, so the reason why we build Zoom Events is, first of all, we really received a lot of feedback from the customer side. They already hosted lots of Zoom webinars. Now we want to do more, especially the pre-events and post-events and how to run everything virtually online, like to take a Zoomtopia, for example, from the planning the Zoom project and all the way to you finish everything, make sure everything you can count on one platform, that's the opportunity coming from, right? However, I think given the last pandemic crisis, you feel like a little bit more pressure for us how to quickly satisfy the customer needs, but we do already have a lot of installed base for Zoom video webinar. I think it's more like a natural migration, right, to the Zoom Events platform. Also as new revenue opportunities, not only driven from corporate events but also later this year for the consumer prosumer events, right? As I mentioned earlier, right, you really can host a very meaningful event, and you can sell tickets to your participant. We have a tight integration with the payment and provider as well. That's the reason why it could be another revenue driver on both corporate side and also on consumer side. Thank you, Matt. Thank you, Matt. Thank you. Sure. I think first of all, you look at only the 2 years, right? Since we launched Zoom Phone, right, last quarter, it's 1 million paid seats. As Graeme shared, on his live session is already 125 million, right. It does tell us something, right. It works, right. So today, you look at a lot of enterprise customers very rapidly deployed on-prem solutions, that's a huge opportunity for every \u2013 the cloud business service provider, including Zoom. So \u2013 and the Zoom \u2013 I think the card business, phone business is big. That market itself accommodated [indiscernible] right. I think we are a part of that. And also you look at other businesses who already deployed cloud-based phone solutions. Our growth is coming from replacing those surgeons with this year a lot of deals, right. And no matter which window, we do see the customer, the job \u2013 the other cloud-based phone solutions switching to us. There are multiple reasons. First of all, we already built their trust. Certainly, if you look at our solution is modern interface, much better integration in the video because, ultimately, we think voice and video are same thing. Those two can be converged into one experience. Otherwise, you deploy several solution for phones, several solution for video. But any of the perspective, it's not consistent. There no work. Zoom is much better positioned than any other windows on that front. And also, you look at our other functionalities, Zoom Events, Apps, and also the Webinars, Zoom Rooms, a lot of other things, overall customer like our experience, right. That's the reason why we look at an opportunity, could it come from enterprise, on-prem deployment or the cloud-based opportunities from other Zoom service products. We do see growth coming from almost everywhere. But again, it's too early to tell. It's only 2 years. Maybe next 2 years, I can share more with some detailed numbers, so... Thank you. My answer is very straightforward. Thank you. Sorry, Rishi, a little bit broken. But anyway, so to answer to your questions, so I happen to read an article today from Bloomberg, right? In May, right, I think they did a survey, right, the 1,000 U.S. adults, right, and 39% of responding \u2013 they mention they need flexibility. If you look at the millennials or the Generation Z, the number increases to the 49%, right? So meaning when you give the flexibility to those employees, otherwise, you are going to lose the clients. So when it comes hybrid, first of all, that will become mainstream. However, different businesses, they might have a different way to manage a hybrid work. Like 2 days in the office or 3 days in the office, it's different, right. And also they might have one week in office, another week at home also it could be different. But overall, the definition of the hybrid work is about flexibility, to give employee flexibility. Yes. This is a great question. Before I talk about next, maybe I'll take a step back to share what had happened, right? Because Zoom was built so for enterprise customers. We never start the K-12 schools or consumers, consumers who are going to use Zoom. We never thought about that pandemic crisis. That's \u2013 by and large, most of the challenge coming from that. However, I think we really take that seriously, right? We doubled \u2013 more than doubled, I mean, the size of a company. The reason why we want to add more resource on privacy security, I can tell you, we have almost 200 people working for the privacy and security now at Zoom, but we're really doubling down on that. That's one. But two is we are so grateful to our customers. The reason why we earn their trust back. They understand what [indiscernible], and that's why a lot of people joined our weekly webinar last May and April, 90 days, and I'm still running the monthly secured webinar, right? We share everything open transparent. Now that's a second thing. Third thing I think we \u2013 security and privacy is not only a feature. It's out of core DNA in terms of process and the functionality, features, road map, innovation areas, right? This is our, I think, a new approach. I've also \u2013 we shared everything with our customers. So, in terms of specific features or enhancement, a lot of smaller things, right. Like recently, we added new dedications. In particular, we added a lot of Zoom apps. In the Zoom apps, you might want to and understand your meeting the content without the [indiscernible] customers was going on, that's not as good from a security perspective, right? A lot of smaller innovations on that front. So again, actually, we do spend a lot of time resource on that. That is still a part of our overall innovation for supporting the privacy and security is extremely important for our future growth. By the way, Tom, we recently look at RSA Security Conference. They are using Zoom as well, right? We have a lot of security companies who standardize on Zoom platform. It does help \u2013 we take security very, very seriously. Thank you. Thank you all. So I really appreciate it. Thank you."

At now, I will turn things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations. Tom, over to you.\nTom McCallum : Thank you, Kelcey. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the fourth quarter and full year of FY '23. I'm joined today by Zoom's Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan; and Zoom's CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.us. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2024, our expectations regarding financial and business trends impacts to the impacts from the macro environment, our market position, opportunities, go-to-market initiatives, growth strategies and business aspirations and product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results which we discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today's webinar. And with that, let me show you a quick video highlighting our exciting technologies before turning the discussion over to Eric. Kelcey, please queue up the video. [Audio/Video Presentation]\nEric Yuan : Wow, that's amazing. Thank you, Tom. And thank you everyone for joining us today. So FY23 was truly a pivotal period in our evolution into a full collaboration platform. As you saw in the video, we launched multiple innovations to help transform work and expanded our product portfolio to open new markets. Since Zoom Contact Center\u2019s release early last year, we have worked hard to expand its features, functionality and integrations. In Q4, we landed a 2,000 seat contact center deal, our largest to date, it truly demonstrated the rapid progress we have made towards becoming a full-fledged contact center solution. The success of our Zoom One bundle, which we launched last June, contributed to the strong performance of Zoom Phone, which in Q4 exceeded 5.5 million seats, making us a clear leader in the space. We closed out the fiscal year with the release of Zoom Virtual Agent, an intelligent conversational AI and chatbot solution that we believe will transform the way businesses assist their customers and employees. FY23 was not without its challenges. We experienced headwinds in terms of currency impact, online contraction, and deal scrutiny which continued into Q4. And a few weeks ago, we made the very tough but necessary decision to reduce our team by 15% and say goodbye to around 1,300 hardworking, talented Zoom colleagues. I want to extend to them my heartfelt appreciation and deepest gratitude for their crucial contributions to Zoom. This painful exercise has been a tremendous learning experience for us. It allows us to look inward to reset ourselves, so we can weather the economic environment with greater focus and agility, deliver for our customers and achieve Zoom\u2019s long-term vision. Now, let me discuss our strategic focuses in FY24 and beyond. First, we\u2019ll help redefine teamwork through offering new immersive experiences that improve employee engagement and modern collaboration tools for ideation across locations and modalities. And we will give teams everything they need through a single pane of glass. Second, the age of AI and large language models has arrived and we want to empower smarter experiences and workflows that truly enable our customers to benefit from these transformational tools. By embedding AI into more workflows, we can provide our customers with richer, more actionable insights that empower them to work smarter and serve their customers better. Zoom IQ, Zoom Virtual Agent, as well as our translation, captioning, and meeting summary tools are just the beginning. We will layer more AI technologies into our products to truly help our customers maximize their ROI on our platform and thrive in this new era of computing Third, we will offer more and more departments tailored solutions to meet their nuanced digital transformation needs. We constantly solicit feedback not only from CIOs, but also heads of sales, customer experience leads and many other leaders across various industries. Zoom IQ for Sales was built in this collaborative fashion and has already added tremendous value to many sales teams. You can expect additional industry-specific and department-specific applications developed both by us and our third party partners.  All of this comes together as a collaboration platform that unites people to unlock their potential, enables more dynamic and intelligent experiences and allows us to reimagine productivity and work. As we navigate this period of technological and economic volatility, our role as a trusted partner providing best-in-class unified communications services has never been more crucial. Again this is a tremendous opportunity in front of us, and we are very confident that our strong foundation, ambitious vision and customer-centric culture will enable us to seize this opportunity and continue to lead the way in the unified communications and collaboration space. Now moving on to some of our customer wins. I want to thank Aramco, one of the world\u2019s leading integrated energy and chemicals companies, for establishing a strategic partnership with Zoom. This is a landmark multi-year partnership where we will provide a full-suite of collaboration services including Zoom Meetings, Team Chat, Phone, Events and Zoom Rooms. In addition, we will work together to build a data center in the region and explore the joint development of innovative technology solutions. We are so grateful that Aramco has chosen to partner with Zoom on their digitization strategy. I\u2019d also like to thank NASDAQ, my favorite company, who has been a Zoom customer for several years. Recognizing Zoom\u2019s strong reliability, security and ease of use, they expanded to Zoom One, our all in one unified communications and collaboration bundle. As part of this expansion, NASDAQ will be deploying Zoom Phone and also adding capabilities like Translation and Advanced Whiteboard to their Zoom Meetings. I want to also thank Raymond James, a leading financial services company, for expanding their relationship with us by integrating Zoom Phone to their Zoom Meetings implementation for a more complete communications package. We are excited to work with Raymond James to provide a highly-reliable and secure system, enabling their employees to communicate, collaborate, and ultimately thrive in the hybrid work world. I want to also thank Barracuda Networks, which builds cloud-first, enterprise grade security solutions, for expanding with Zoom. A longstanding Zoom Meetings customer, Barracuda saw the value of having a single platform for all their communications needs, and upgraded wall-to-wall to Zoom One Enterprise Plus in Q4. In addition, Barracuda also chose Zoom IQ for Sales to enhance sales engagement and Zoom Contact Center to elevate the customer experience. Again, thank you Aramco, NASDAQ, Raymond James, Barracuda Networks, and all of our customers worldwide.  And before closing, let me express my warm welcome to Cindy Hoots for joining our Board of Directors. Cindy brings a wealth of experience and currently is the Chief Digital Officer and Chief Information Officer at AstraZeneca. We are so excited to work with her. I also want to welcome our new Chief Product Officer, Smita Hashim, who joins us from a seasoned executive career at Microsoft and Google. We are also super excited to work with her. And with that, I'll pass over to Kelly. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg : Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. Let me start with a few of the financial highlights for FY '23 and the results for Q4 and then provide our outlook for Q1 and FY '24. We delivered solid results in FY '23. Here were some of the highlights. Our Enterprise business grew 24%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.9%, and we achieved a free cash flow margin of 27%. In Q4, total revenue came in at $1.118 billion, up 4% year-over-year and 6% in constant currency. This result was approximately $13 million above the high end of our guidance. The growth in revenue was primarily driven by strength in our Enterprise business, which grew 18% year-over-year and represented 57% of total revenue, up from 50% a year ago. We expect Enterprise customers to comprise an increasingly higher percentage of total revenue over time. From a product perspective, we had strong growth in Zoom Phone, coupled with contribution from Zoom Rooms and other products. Online average monthly churn decreased to 3.4% from 3.8% in Q4 of FY '22 and increased slightly from 3.1% in Q3 as expected due to seasonality. The number of Enterprise customers grew 12% year-over-year to approximately 213,000. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q4 came in at a healthy 115%. We saw a 27% year-over-year growth in the upmarket as we ended the quarter with 3,471 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 28% of revenue, up from 23% in Q4 of FY '22 and span diverse industries such as healthcare, education, government and more.  Our Americas revenue grew 10% year-over-year. EMEA continues to be impacted by the stronger dollar, macro headwinds and online performance, which combined led to a decline of 9% year-over-year. APAC also impacted by the stronger dollar declined 5% year-over-year. Now turning to expenses and margins. A quick note on our GAAP results. In Q4, they included a onetime stock-based compensation expense of $208 million due to the sunsetting of our supplemental grant program, which carries neither dilutive nor tax deduction impacts. Moving on to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 79.8%, an improvement from 78.3% in Q4 of last year and 79.5% last quarter. The sequential improvement was mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers. For FY '24, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 79.5%. Research and development expense grew by 43% year-over-year to approximately $103 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 9.2% from 6.7% in Q4 of last year, reflecting our investments in expanding our product portfolio. Looking ahead, innovation will remain a top priority for Zoom.  Sales and marketing expense grew by 20% year-over-year to $301 million. This represented approximately 26.9% of total revenue, up from 23.4% in Q4 of last year. As part of our restructuring, we are optimizing our go-to-market strategy to better support our enterprise customers and drive additional productivity. G&A expense declined by 12% to $84 million or approximately 7.5% of total revenue, down from 8.9% in Q4 of last year as we focused on achieving greater efficiencies in our back office. Non-GAAP operating income was $405 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $326 million as we took actions to reprioritize our investments in Q4. This translates to a 36.2% non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 as compared to 39.2% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.22, $0.44 above the high end of our guidance. Due to our share repurchase program, our Q4 weighted average share count has decreased year-over-year by approximately 5 million shares to 301 million. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year from $1.2 billion. This is above our guidance as we saw increased commitments from customers and extended contract durations. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $3.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year from $2.6 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 56% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 63% in Q4 of last year. As a reminder, our annual seasonality of renewals is weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect Q1 deferred revenue to be up zero to 1% year-over-year partially due to the strengthening of the dollar starting late in Q1 of FY '23. Since then, the major currencies we do business in are down 5% to 10% vis-a-vis the dollar. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $212 million, up from $209 million in Q4 of last year. Free cash flow was $183 million as compared to $189 million in Q4 of last year. Our margins for operating cash flow and free cash flow were 18.9% and 16.4%, respectively. Because the Section 174 tax legislation requiring capitalization of R&D expenses was not repealed in FY '23, we incurred an additional cash tax payment in Q4. Despite this payment, we still exceeded the high end of our previously provided range by $36 million for a full year total of $1.186 billion. For FY '24, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion. Now turning to guidance. For the first quarter of FY '24, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.08 billion to $1.085 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 1% year-over-year growth or 2% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $374 million to $379 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.96 to $0.98 based on approximately 304 million shares outstanding. This outlook reflects the three fewer days in Q1 versus all other quarters. For the full year of FY '24, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.435 billion to $4.455 billion, which at the midpoint represents approximately 1% of year-over-year growth or 2% in constant currency. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.606 billion to $1.626 billion, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 36%. Our tax rate is expected to approximate the blended U.S. federal and state rates. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $4.11 to $4.18 based on approximately 309 million shares outstanding. Zoom is dedicated to maintaining a careful balance between growth and profitability. We remain committed to innovating our platform, optimizing our go-to-market motions and evolving our culture to meet the dynamic needs of the market. We are confident that our continued investment in innovation will enable us to provide an even greater value to our customers, while also positioning us for sustained growth. Thank you to the Zoom employees, our customers, our community and our investors. Kelcey, please queue up our first question.\nA - Kelcey McKinley: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Fred Lee with Credit Suisse.\nFred Lee : Kelly, just a question regarding the full year operating margin guide, which looks like it's coming in around 5 percentage points above consensus. I was wondering if you could break down where those efficiencies are coming from, how much was coming from the RIF versus efficiencies in other operating expense line items.\nKelly Steckelberg : Yes. Thank you. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we started really focusing on driving efficiencies across the business in Q4, as you saw in the results. This came from looking across all third-party spend and then as we moved into Q1, of course, the reduction. And so it's really a combination of that as well as looking across all of our business processes, including go-to-market where there's a restructuring happening to really focus the resources on our enterprise customers and be as efficient as we can in our commercial and small business teams.\nFred Lee : Got it. And a quick question for Eric. With regard to everything that's happening around AI and generative AI, you've talked a little bit about some of the new product areas where you're expecting some initial impact. So how would you -- what kind of analogy can you draw for investors and for us with regard to the uptake of all things generative AI. A little bit of commentary around that would be greatly appreciated.\nEric Yuan : Sure. So yes, first of all, that's a great question about AI. I think your question about AI sort of reminds me of 1995, 1996, when Internet was -- the first wave of Internet revolution. I was so excited. That's why I moved to Silicon Valley, right, to embrace that first wave of revolution. And since then I was a stuck for real-time collaboration until today. I can tell you, speaking of AI, I'm as excited as 1995, maybe sorry I'm wrong, maybe more excited than 1995, 1996, given my engineering and product background. I think AI [Indiscernible] sort of faces a challenge; at the same time, also have a huge opportunity ahead of us, right? Given our strong innovation culture, I think AI can truly help Zoom, right, to evolve us -- to cut sort of part of the Zoom 2.0 journey, right? I think Zoom may be the AI-first company. Speaking of specifically features how to leverage AI. And even before we talk about ChatGPT and talk about all those AI, actually, we already invest having on AI, right? So some customers may not see that, right? Like noise reduction, even with background, a lot of things like that. Even recently, we announced a feature called Zoom Smart and Meeting Summary where we already leveraged GPT-3 to augment our ML to improve that experience. And we are going to double down and triple down on AI a lot of features like Virtual Agent or Zoom IQ for Sales, our chat solution, even [Indiscernible] as well, I think AI can truly empower everything we are doing here and will benefit the customers. Plus we are taking a very open approach. And we have our own AI engineers, a lot of talents working very hard and also are going to partner with other companies. OpenAI is a great company and just plugged recently. And this is great. Again, I can talk a lot about AI. I'm very, very excited.\nKelcey McKinley: And Michael Funk with Bank of America has the next question.\nMichael Funk : Okay. First for you, Eric. [Indiscernible] cash balance is a huge strategic asset for Zoom, specifically today, when a lot of your competitors don't have that optionality. So what is the argument in your opinion, against deploying that cash to further your advantage and improve your capacity?\nEric Yuan : So when it comes to money better to delegate it to Kelley, probably she is better to have managed that so.\nKelly Steckelberg : Thank you, Michael. I don't think there is any argument against deploying our cash, certainly to continue to advance our technology, advance our customer base. As I said, we are constantly looking for opportunities. And as I've mentioned in the past, we have kind of 3 main criteria, of course, we look at. We look at the technology as we want to make sure that we would be providing our customers something that works as well as the core of Zoom does today the core Zoom platform. We look at the culture to make sure that the organizations could come together very, very well. As you know, we take culture so seriously here. And Eric and the whole executive team have spent a lot of time focusing on building that. And then last but certainly not least, is valuation. And that has been tricky in the past. We've seen great assets that we love. We just couldn't get there as, unfortunately, all of you know. And so we now see that becoming easier and easier. So I will tell you that Sanjay and his team have been very busy continuing to look for targets for us, and it certainly is a part of our strategy that we're considering for FY '24.\nMichael Funk : And Kelly, while I have you, back to the earlier question about the delta and operating income, fiscal '23 to fiscal '24. We estimated [Indiscernible] about a $260 million benefit from the RIF. Is there an issue with my math around that?\nKelly Steckelberg : We're not going to get into the specifics around the reduction. I will tell you, it was pretty consistently applied across the company, the 15% that Eric mentioned, across the organizations as well as U.S. and some of our other locations outside of the U.S. So you can take that into consideration as you're calculating what you think the savings are.\nKelcey McKinley: We will now move on to Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall : Great. Maybe, Kelly, just for you to start with, maybe versus where we were 90 days ago when you were kind of talking about low to mid-single-digit potential for fiscal '24. Just trying to get a sense of is kind of the incremental conservatism? Is that more around the enterprise or the online business, particularly given that you did see some kind of stabilization in the online business in the quarter?\nKelly Steckelberg : Yes. I guess, I don't know that I would say -- I mean, remember on the Q3 call, we weren't specifically giving guidance. We were trying to help sort of give, I think, a little bit of visibility, but we were still right in the midst of doing our FY '24 planning. So as we continue to work on that with all of the go-to-market teams and also made this decision around the team and the reduction, putting all of that together came up with what we've now guided to. And we do continue to see headwinds that we spoke about. Of course, currency is still a challenge, and we're going to see some -- as compared to year-over-year, we're going to see some impact in Q1 because remember, the dollar really started to strengthen the back half of Q1 last year. So you should expect to see some year-over-year impact there as well as just these changes in -- especially the go-to-market teams right now, making sure that we get everybody lined up and looking at where that is. But all of that was considered as we set the FY '24 guidance.\nMeta Marshall : Got it. And then maybe, Eric, in the past, you guys have wanted to have kind of this singular Zoom platform and let the third-party apps be where you would kind of do the departmental or industry use cases. And sounded like there was some departure from that. So I guess I just wanted to get a sense of are there going to be different Zoom additions for kind of some of these different verticals? Or will it still kind of be largely third-party driven?\nEric Yuan : Yes, I think that's a good question. First of all, I don't think that we will depart -- it\u2019s departure to what are we trying to do before, so meaning more like an augment to whatever doing now. Because given a lot of new opportunities, I do not think everything should be done by our own developers, right? And that's why we also want to leverage the third party. I do -- not something tuning as a strategy, just more augment to what we're doing today.\nKelcey McKinley: [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead, and we'll move on to Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: So you've added so much value into the product. When we look at the amount of recording storage, the white-boarding, you have mail and calendar client and so much more that's on the come. Could you update us perhaps on your pricing strategy and whether you think this could be the right time to perhaps increase prices a bit or even to just go out of maybe activate a CPI adjustment that would benefit you.\nEric Yuan : Yes, Kelly, please go ahead.\nKelly Steckelberg : Sure. We have announced a price increase for our online customers that we will be effective. I believe the date is March 1, as we announced it last -- earlier this month, and we believe that reflects -- and that's only for monthly customers, not for annual customers. And we believe that starts to reflect the value, as you said, that we have created for our customers over the last few years it's been many, many, many years, it predates me since the last time there was a price increase. And then on the Enterprise side, we did a pricing update all-inclusive with Zoom One, the bundle that we came up with last year. And we believe that really reflects the best way for our customers to buy and to get full value out of the platform. And that considers all of the products that are included and what we feel is an appropriate price point at this time.\nMark Murphy : Okay. But so nothing planned outside of Zoom One on the Enterprise side and nothing more material than what you had already announced.\nKelly Steckelberg : Yes. That's right.\nKelcey McKinley: Piper Sandler's James Fish has the next question.\nQuinton Gabrielli : This is Quinton on for Jim Fish. In terms of the longer-term vision for Zoom, how is the team thinking about the maturity of the core meetings and phone products at this point, especially following what was a really strong Phone quarter in Q4. Do we need adoption of emerging products like Contact Center and e-mail or calendar to reaccelerate growth as we look to '25 and '26. Or are there catalysts that can help the core products kind of reaccelerate from the guided 2024 levels?\nEric Yuan : I think -- great question. I think we sort of focused on both. I take Phone for example, the market potential is still huge. And we are doing extremely well and will help us more because given the product, very reliable as it's really innovation and better than any other phone service providers. That's why on core part, I see the huge growth opportunity. On to side of that, the new products Zoom Contact Center, Virtual Agent and Zoom IQ for Sales down the road, and more and more department of applications, in particular AI and is not a grid layer, I feel like a lot of new opportunity ahead of us. I think in the second half of this year, probably the transition period for us, given the -- we launched the Contact Center early last year, Zoom IQ for Sales as well. Although the new services, plus new services in the pipeline, I think, will help us. We need to focus on both. The reason why our real distributor are all-in-one collaboration platform, right? You can leave within a Zoom interface, can get most of work done, right? I think that that's our business.\nKelcey McKinley: Rishi Jaluria with RBC has the next question.\nRishi Jaluria : I just wanted to have one, which I wanted to dive a little bit deeper into some of the new features I think you're seeing. I know Mark brought out earlier, but if you think about chat, male calendaring. Just to the extent possible, I would love to hear what have you seen in terms of actual uptake rates of these features, right? Because it's available to anyone who's on Zoom One, but probably are actively using it. And if you think about those customers who are using these additional features or modules, what are you seeing from those customers in terms of anything like engagement, time spent on the platform retention, ARPU expansion rates, anything like that. Because I think that would really help us get some color in terms of your ability to expand into a broader Enterprise communication platform.\nEric Yuan : Yes, that's a great question. First of all, I would say, last year, we developed more than 1,500 features. I think our team worked extremely hard. But one thing we did not do well, I think we should improve -- read about the product adoption and say, after we finish the development features, we also need to remember customers may not know it. Again, this is something important for us this year. Having said that, a lot of customers in order to find a lot of good features, take NASDAQ for example, right? They would like to consolidate like meeting with a Whiteboard as well. It has a Whiteboard. They really like that, right? And also now the feature, we will also have a Team Chat, which is a precision chat solutions. We use that for many years, a lot of invest customers also deployed. Why do they want to pay for other services off their phone wall. Zoom has a very scalable also very flexible, the grid and the Team Chat solution after they found that they tested, they also like that, right? They also doubled all those features. A lot of things like that, not to mention the sales department, right? And upsell Zoom IQ for Sales opportunity. Again, a lot of innovations but we need focus on product adoption, let the customer know that there\u2019s huge value from the Zoom platform, right? So that's something we need to focus on. And quite a few -- probably all use Zoom Team Chat. I can tell you, again, it's much better, Whiteboard as well. So anyway, a lot of features, innovations, we should focus on adoption.\nKelcey McKinley: And we will now hear from Matt Vanvliet with BTIG.\nMatt VanVliet : I guess on the last point, Eric, curious maybe if you could share a few details or some of the winning points around the Contact Center product. What's driving the adoption there? Are you seeing replacing existing Contact Centers? Or are some of these sort of net new where video is going to be a key component, whether it's field service or things of that nature where video really lends an extra help to it?\nEric Yuan : Yes, great question. So on product front, right? So we are -- we launched it early last year, right, almost one-year anniversary now. I think we are going to keep innovating and essentially, today, look at our -- the Contact Center customer, we just closed the 2,000 seat contact center solution, right? We tested everything well. Zoom Contact Center works very well, not only for the -- just -- like early last year, we won quite a few deals for internal IT helpdesk. This is for the support agent, right? A lot of features are already built in. I think the protocol front in adding any more and more features very quickly. I think we are doing very well. I have a huge confidence for our team -- product team. However, on the go to market side, I think we should have done a better job, to be honest with you, right? And because the buyer is different, right? The good news over the past 12 months, we learned a lot, working to sort of change our go-to-market strategy, right? And make sure all those traditional customers no matter which on-premise solution and deploy or other cloud contact center deployed, we should let them know, right? Zoom has very scalable contact center solutions like those third-party resellers, right, and also we need to change our go-to-market model for contact center because the product works so well. So that part, I think we need to focus on this year.\nKelcey McKinley: And our next question will come from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke : So clearly, the profitability guidance was much stronger than consensus and you've talked about some of the hard decisions you've made as it relates to restructuring. Kelly and Eric, I'm wondering just about your willingness to kind of expand margins from here. Obviously, you're guiding to a pretty low revenue growth for the coming year of about 1%. But how do you just think about the puts and takes on future margin expansion from here in a scenario where you don't get a reacceleration in total revenue?\nKelly Steckelberg : Tyler, we're always focused on being as efficient as possible in our gross margin. And you've seen -- we said we expect to be 79.5% for next year, which is right on top of our long-term target margins. In terms of our operating margins, we want to always watch for opportunities for investment in top line is that's really what we are driving for. So we will continue to make these decisions and watch for opportunities throughout the year if we see opportunities to invest in go-to-market, maybe channel programs, anything that we can do to drive top line growth, that would be our first priority. But as we said in the prepared remarks, we're going to balance that with profitability. So we're certainly committed to the guidance that we set, I don't think we're committing to expanding beyond that today. As again, our first priority is continuing to accelerate through go-to-market efficiencies as well as continuing to expand our product portfolio.\nKelcey McKinley: UBS's Karl Keirstead has the next question. But Kelly and Eric, he's on audio only. So he won't appear to you via video. Karl, go ahead.\nKarl Keirstead : I'm good. Thank you. Sorry.\nKelcey McKinley: No problem with that. In that case, we'll move on to Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSitikantha Panigrahi : Thanks for taking my question, Kelly and Eric. So when you think about this year's growth, I know you're expecting some online segment to kind of bottom at some point. So what's your expectation when you think about online segment versus enterprise? I know this is, again, renewal will come in Q1, Q2. And what are you now pushing to our customer during renewal? I know last few years, it is Phone. So what other products you're right now pushing to renewal.\nKelly Steckelberg : So in terms of the expectations for online this year, they are consistent with what we've been saying for the last couple of quarters, which we expect it to stabilize during mid next year from a dollar amount, meaning starting to see the -- we've seen it continue to decline quarter-over-quarter from a dollar perspective for the last probably five or six quarters. And when we get kind of like Q2 to Q3 of next year, we expect to see that start to stabilize, which is great. When you look at all the initiatives that are in place. And then -- I'm sorry, the last part of your question about renewals was about?\nSitikantha Panigrahi : Also Enterprise part of the business, how you're thinking about the growth and renewal.\nKelly Steckelberg : Yes. So renewals were not, right? There's always an opportunity to talk to our Enterprise customers around Zoom One, the platform bundle, which we think is a great opportunity for our enterprise customers to help our prospects and customers understand the full features of the platform. And then, of course, there is a natural opportunity to do that as they're going through the renewal period. And as we guided, we expect renewals to be strong in Q1. However, there is going to be that impact of currency that we've already experienced for Q2 through Q4. But unfortunately, we have one more quarter against the previous year comps that there's going to be some impact and some headwinds there.\nKelcey McKinley: And Sterling Auty with SVB MoffetNathanson has the next question.\nSterling Auty : Kelly, maybe just to clarify on that last answer, now that we're in fiscal '24 on that online answer you just gave, you meant that we'd see the turn Q2, Q3 of this fiscal year, correct?\nKelly Steckelberg : Yes, this fiscal year, yes. For FY' 23.\nSterling Auty : I just want to make sure people didn't think fiscal '25 so.\nKelly Steckelberg : Not FY '25. No. Thank you, Sterling.\nSterling Auty : You\u2019re welcome. So in terms of questions, I want to take the other side of it and go to the enterprise. What's built into the expectation for full year revenue around the enterprise and maybe dive into at least some qualitative commentary around net retention and what you expect on renewals from customers and what you're expecting from contribution of new customers. So what needs to happen for the enterprise to deliver that side?\nKelly Steckelberg : So we expect renewals -- we talked about renewals over the last year, the last 12 months, and we expect them to consider -- continue at kind of the same rate. And what we've mentioned in the past is that we have seen some contraction in seats as organizations around the world are experiencing reductions. So working with them on that. But on the other side, the opportunity to really bring a lot of value to our customers through our total cost of ownership, which includes expansion of the total portfolio. So as you saw, Phone really, really resonating very well, especially in this economy. And Contact Center, while it's still small, small from an absolute dollar perspective, it doubled the ARR for contact center doubled from Q3 to Q4. So again, small relative dollars, but really exciting to see it coming into its own. And that -- we expect that to continue to contribute through all of this year, but then really start to accelerate from a contribution perspective in FY '25, and I do mean FY '25 in that comment. And then, of course, there's Zoom IQ for Sales as well, which is on kind of a similar trajectory in terms of contact center, that small dollar contribution, but accelerating in terms of its overall growth.\nKelcey McKinley: We'll now now hear from Matt Stotler with William Blair.\nMatthew Stotler : Maybe just one on -- a follow-up on Zoom One. You mentioned some strength there, obviously, relatively early days, a couple of quarters in I would love to get some color on maybe the portion of new customers that are going with the Zoom One bundle versus other paths to buying Zoom products? And then what the characteristics are that you're seeing of those early adopters, right, both in terms of customer size, whether they're adopting that for specific departments and rolling that out like you've seen the core meetings product historically. Any color there would be helpful.\nKelly Steckelberg : I think what's amazing and really interesting about Zoom One is it's not just new customers that are buying the Zoom One bundle, it's existing customers as well that are upgrading. And as a reminder, it includes Zoom Meetings, but also Zoom Phone. It includes Team Chat and Whiteboard. So really starting to see customers embracing the full effects of the platform. We have a Fortune 10 customer now that is a long-standing customer of ours that moved on to the Zoom One bundle and has standardized on Zoom Team Chat, which we're super excited to see. So that's the example of what starts to happen when these customers are really exposed to the full value of the platform that we can bring to them. And I don't know exactly the percentage of how it broke out in Q3 -- Q4, but it is really starting to take the lead in terms of how our enterprise sales teams are selling. Anything you want to add, Eric?\nEric Yuan : No, that's great.\nKelcey McKinley: Moving on to Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKasthuri Rangan : Good to see you guys, Eric and Kelly. I just wanted to understand how we should reconcile the guidance going forward vis-a-vis what seems to be pretty close to the anniversary effect of the SMB attrition and then we should start to really mirror the growth of the so-called enterprise business, but the guidance still seems to be quite conservative. And just help us understand what might have happened at a higher level, incrementally relative to this anniversary effect and what we should be seeing by this time, a real acceleration of the business.\nKelly Steckelberg : Sure. So one thing to remember, Kash, is that while we are expecting the online portion of the business to stabilize from a dollar perspective during the year, it is still down year-over-year because of what happened in FY '23, where it was much higher. The dollar amounts were much higher in those earlier quarters as it came down. So we still have the unfortunate impact of the online segment of the business tamping down the growth of the Enterprise business. And so that's what you're seeing reflected there. And so the stabilization that occurs this year will really help as we look forward to next year, which we've always said is sort of reacceleration to the back half of this year into FY '25. And that's what we see in our internal models today.\nKasthuri Rangan : Got it. Curious, Kelly, why does it take until fiscal '25 to see the effect -- the net effect will be positive. Can you help us understand the timing of why it takes another year from now?\nKelly Steckelberg : Well, there's the combination, first of all. Online is still down year-over-year. And so you're not going to start to see the year-over-year stabilization of online until the back half of -- even though the dollars are stabilizing, right, the year-over-year comparables are still down until the very back half of this year. And then while we've seen all the strength we've talked about on Zoom One and Zoom Phone, part of the expected growth is coming from these other newer products that are still -- so they're doing great, all positive indicators, but they're still early in their trajectory. But if you remember and think about how where Zoom Phone was in its second year of life, that's where Zoom Contact Center and to Zoom IQ for Sales. And now you see Zoom Phone, which is about to turn 4, I believe, how it's really contributing. So we've just got a little time ahead to get those products maturing and really contributing.\nKelcey McKinley: We'll now here from Bernstein's Peter Weed.\nPeter Weed: Maybe I'll follow up on that and kind of reinforce what appears to be a reasonably conservative revenue guide this year when we start to think about some of the things you've chatted about earlier in this conversation, everything from stabilization in the online business, which may even do better than that perhaps, hopefully, with some of the pricing increases that go on all of the product that you've that you've been shipping these types of things. And when we take into account the fact that a year ago on the top line, this business was even a little bit smaller than what we're anticipating in quarter one, this upcoming year might be. Help me understand why we would do as bad, I guess, has only a 1% year-over-year, like what's the downside case that gets us there. Or is this more of an opportunity to perhaps start to see some of the lift coming out of here?\nKelly Steckelberg : So remember, for Q1, there is the definite impact of being three fewer days, which has real impact as compared to three fewer days of rev rec as well as the impact of currency, which we didn't have last year. So that year-over-year impact is going to definitely be visible in Q1 of FY '24. And then we continue to see in the Enterprise, elongated sales cycles, deal scrutiny, I was sort of lapping with a fellow CFO saying, this is the year of the CFO because I have gotten invited to speak at more sales kickoffs this year than you can imagine because every sales team is having to learn how to sell to the CFO and including ours. And that is exactly the experience that we're having. And so it just means they're taking a little bit longer and everybody is being very, very thoughtful about their purchases. And so all of that was taken into consideration as we set our full year guidance.\nPeter Weed: I guess many of those things are stuff, I guess, in the second half of this year. You have been addressing and are kind of carrying forward, so they're not kind of brand new. I would think that some of this unless you are anticipating another leg down for some reason, are there any additional legs down relative to things that you've been already seeing in the business? Or is this just conservatism on like we just don't know how long this stuff is going to really be impacting? And we can't really say how much people are going to be purchasing the Zoom One bundle, which is kind of the standard thing that you're putting out really how well people are going to react to price increases this year so that it's really created a floor on which we hope to do better than.\nKelly Steckelberg : I definitely think there is a question as to the state of the economy. And when it comes to investments, while we think we are incredibly well positioned with our total cost of ownership and the value that we bring to our customers, everybody is being very cautious until there's better visibility about the potential of a recession or not and where we're going to come through this. And we expect that could impact us at least through the rest of this year.\nKelcey McKinley: Taz Koujalgi with Wedbush has the next question.\nImtiaz Koujalgi : Two questions, one for Eric. Eric, when you spoke about Zoom One traction in the quarter. And it's still pretty early. I understand that, but when you sell a customer Zoom One from Zoom Meetings, what is the difficult uplift you're seeing in the deal sizes? Let's say somebody has Zoom Meetings today and that were to Zoom One, what is the kind of the uptick you get in the deal value there?\nEric Yuan : Yes. Normally -- it is a great question. It comes from upmarket opportunities, right? And a lot of our SMB customers, they do not use like Whiteboard and some other cool features. As an Enterprise customer, given the economic uncertainty and challenged cost reduction, they would like to consolidate, right, into one platform, right? And most of the tool from a total window perspective. When you look at the Zoom product, they're trying to understand what kind of other services features they can leverage more and then also toggle with my Whiteboard and Team Chat, Contact Center, Zoom IQ for Sales, more and more upsell opportunity. This is a great time for those upmarket customers, especially commercial and enterprise customers, right? Because they already trust our brand. They know those services they\u2019re provided for example, they know we are doing innovating. They know our service will be better than others, why not deploy Zoom Whiteboard. This is a great example.\nImtiaz Koujalgi : So the early deals that you've had so far, what is the uplift you've seen in, I guess, dollars you're getting from that customer? How much some do you see typically, I guess, as an uptick factor when somebody goes from just using Zoom Meetings to using Zoom One? What is the -- what's the, I guess, the upsell or the uptick in the deal value?\nKelly Steckelberg : It really depends on the customer. The thing that I would point out, though, is it's not just the uplift in the dollar amount. It's the retention that we see, which is really important to us as customers that have more -- I remember at Analyst Day, we showed that chart that like -- I can't remember exactly what it is more than 50% improved retention rates when they have more than one product deployed. And so the value of us having a broader platform in there, including the one that is much more intensive like Zoom Chat and Zoom Phone really brings a lot of value to us.\nImtiaz Koujalgi : Got it. And just one follow-up, Kelly. Typically, we see customers -- companies having free cash flow margins, higher than operating margins. U.S. reversed last year. I think you had a drag from cash taxes and stock-based comp. Is there -- would that -- again, your guide implies free cash flow margin, I believe, lower by about 9 points from operating margin. Does that reverse at the point in the future? Or do we see that as more of a permanent.\nKelly Steckelberg : Given that we are a cash tax payer for here to eternity now, I think you're likely to see it be slightly under, but what we're getting back to, which was very disruptive last year is a more normalized relationship between those two as we're on more of a normal force now from a cash tax perspective.\nKelcey McKinley: Moving on to Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark.\nMatthew Harrigan : I'm sorry, I tried to take myself out of the queue. I send the message.\nKelcey McKinley: No problem at all. Thanks, Matthew. All right. Well, we'll go ahead in that case and move on to William Power with Baird.\nWilliam Power : Great. A lot of my questions have been answered, but I did want to ask about Zoom Phone. It looked like a particularly strong quarter. I think the push around Zoom One is probably helping. But it'd be great to get any other perspective on what seems to be a nice acceleration there in Zoom Phone adoption? And any color you're able to provide just around pricing trends? And when does this become a 10% revenue component?\nKelly Steckelberg : In terms of when it's going to become 10%, it's sometime -- September early this year in FY '24 and we are very excited about the momentum. We had a 100% year-over-year growth in the product. And you get it's back to -- even in this economy and especially in this economy, companies looking for opportunities to standardize on 1 vendor and also because there is a lot of value to be gained by getting rid of those on-prem servers as well as the very disruptive price point that we have, all the way around, it's just proving to be very, very attractive. And as Eric mentioned, there's still a lot of opportunity in market available. So we expect that to continue. I don't know it's going to expect -- just to remind everybody, Q2 and Q4 tend to be our really peak quarters in terms of Zoom Phone adds. So while we had an amazing number of additions in Q4, I don't expect that necessarily to be the new bar. We expect to be seasonally down in Q1, but still very excited, but the momentum continues to be up and to the right.\nKelcey McKinley: JMP Securities' Patrick Walravens has the next question.\nPatrick Walravens : Great. I have a really fun question for Eric. So Eric, in 2021, you guys invested in Cvent, before their deal you also invested in Monday. So how do you feel about those two spaces today? How do you feel about the VET technology? And how do you feel about collaborative work management.\nEric Yuan : So given this is the Phone question, maybe I should launch the ChatGPT, let it answer to your questions, it\u2019s better. So I might give you a fun answer. Well, anyway, I think monday.com interesting, right? Because the reason why I invest in -- a lot of our customers, they also -- especially in Europe, right, also deploy the service, they would like them to integrate with us and also they\u2019re also Zoom customers as well. I think as far as I know. And I think it's more like from a customer perspective, right, the one -- also working together, right, to integrate with them, that's reason why I invest in them, right? Cvent, for example, during COVID, right, and a lot of customers deployed our Zoom and more Webinars and Zoom Events. And especially for those hybrid events, right, in-person events, we are more like a pure technology platform, right? We\u2019re also in some other components to help to make sure we have streamlined your events management. That's why we partnered with Cvent, right? We see the opportunity to further solidify our leadership, why not to invest in them. I think given now it's more a company we support hybrid work, I think Cvent -- I think they will do well. That's another reason why we invested in them, yes. So that's pretty much. Maybe my answer not as fun as the ChatGPT, but that's pretty much I can do.\nKelcey McKinley: We do have time for one additional question that will come from Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays.\nRyan MacWilliams : My question is kind of in the same spirit as Pat's question. But Kelly, let's like you filled the remaining amount of your share repurchase authorization this quarter? I guess, how are you thinking about a new authorization for a buyback. And in terms of M&A, would Zoom potentially look at acquisitions where you already have a competing product today? Or are you generally looking at adjacent solutions?\nKelly Steckelberg : In terms of M&A, we look at both. We've been very successful in the past by buying those technology tuck-ins to accelerate our development, as you've seen with the Saudi acquisition, which has been a great accelerant for us in terms of Contact Center and continue to look at those, but also looking at other areas that there might be leaders in the space that makes sense for us. So we're continuing to look at both. And we -- every quarter, we talk to our Board about our capital allocation strategy. And of course, M&A is at the top of the list. We do not, as you indicated, have a buyback authorization in place today. We will continue to look for opportunities to deploy our capital in the best way possible for our investors. And right now, we -- again, as I said earlier, our #1 focus is reaccelerating top line growth and making sure that we have the flexibility to do that if opportunities arise. And so that's why, for the moment, we've decided to hold at least on requesting an authorization for a buyback.\nKelcey McKinley: And again, everyone, that does conclude our Q&A for today. I'll go ahead and pass it back to you, Eric, for any closing or additional comments.\nEric Yuan : Thank you, all. Really appreciate you time. Love you, all. Thank you. Take care.\nKelly Steckelberg : Bye, everybody.\nKelcey McKinley: Thank you. And again, everyone, this does conclude today's earnings release. As always, we thank you all for your participation, and we look forward to seeing you again in the spring and summer. Until then, take care and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. Let me start with a few of the financial highlights for FY '23 and the results for Q4 and then provide our outlook for Q1 and FY '24. We delivered solid results in FY '23. Here were some of the highlights. Our Enterprise business grew 24%. Our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.9%, and we achieved a free cash flow margin of 27%. In Q4, total revenue came in at $1.118 billion, up 4% year-over-year and 6% in constant currency. This result was approximately $13 million above the high end of our guidance. The growth in revenue was primarily driven by strength in our Enterprise business, which grew 18% year-over-year and represented 57% of total revenue, up from 50% a year ago. We expect Enterprise customers to comprise an increasingly higher percentage of total revenue over time. From a product perspective, we had strong growth in Zoom Phone, coupled with contribution from Zoom Rooms and other products. Online average monthly churn decreased to 3.4% from 3.8% in Q4 of FY '22 and increased slightly from 3.1% in Q3 as expected due to seasonality. The number of Enterprise customers grew 12% year-over-year to approximately 213,000. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q4 came in at a healthy 115%. We saw a 27% year-over-year growth in the upmarket as we ended the quarter with 3,471 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 28% of revenue, up from 23% in Q4 of FY '22 and span diverse industries such as healthcare, education, government and more.  Our Americas revenue grew 10% year-over-year. EMEA continues to be impacted by the stronger dollar, macro headwinds and online performance, which combined led to a decline of 9% year-over-year. APAC also impacted by the stronger dollar declined 5% year-over-year. Now turning to expenses and margins. A quick note on our GAAP results. In Q4, they included a onetime stock-based compensation expense of $208 million due to the sunsetting of our supplemental grant program, which carries neither dilutive nor tax deduction impacts. Moving on to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 79.8%, an improvement from 78.3% in Q4 of last year and 79.5% last quarter. The sequential improvement was mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers. For FY '24, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 79.5%. Research and development expense grew by 43% year-over-year to approximately $103 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 9.2% from 6.7% in Q4 of last year, reflecting our investments in expanding our product portfolio. Looking ahead, innovation will remain a top priority for Zoom.  Sales and marketing expense grew by 20% year-over-year to $301 million. This represented approximately 26.9% of total revenue, up from 23.4% in Q4 of last year. As part of our restructuring, we are optimizing our go-to-market strategy to better support our enterprise customers and drive additional productivity. G&A expense declined by 12% to $84 million or approximately 7.5% of total revenue, down from 8.9% in Q4 of last year as we focused on achieving greater efficiencies in our back office. Non-GAAP operating income was $405 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $326 million as we took actions to reprioritize our investments in Q4. This translates to a 36.2% non-GAAP operating margin for Q4 as compared to 39.2% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q4 was $1.22, $0.44 above the high end of our guidance. Due to our share repurchase program, our Q4 weighted average share count has decreased year-over-year by approximately 5 million shares to 301 million. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.3 billion, up 11% year-over-year from $1.2 billion. This is above our guidance as we saw increased commitments from customers and extended contract durations. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $3.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year from $2.6 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 56% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 63% in Q4 of last year. As a reminder, our annual seasonality of renewals is weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect Q1 deferred revenue to be up zero to 1% year-over-year partially due to the strengthening of the dollar starting late in Q1 of FY '23. Since then, the major currencies we do business in are down 5% to 10% vis-a-vis the dollar. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $212 million, up from $209 million in Q4 of last year. Free cash flow was $183 million as compared to $189 million in Q4 of last year. Our margins for operating cash flow and free cash flow were 18.9% and 16.4%, respectively. Because the Section 174 tax legislation requiring capitalization of R&D expenses was not repealed in FY '23, we incurred an additional cash tax payment in Q4. Despite this payment, we still exceeded the high end of our previously provided range by $36 million for a full year total of $1.186 billion. For FY '24, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.25 billion. Now turning to guidance. For the first quarter of FY '24, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.08 billion to $1.085 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 1% year-over-year growth or 2% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $374 million to $379 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.96 to $0.98 based on approximately 304 million shares outstanding. This outlook reflects the three fewer days in Q1 versus all other quarters. For the full year of FY '24, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.435 billion to $4.455 billion, which at the midpoint represents approximately 1% of year-over-year growth or 2% in constant currency. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.606 billion to $1.626 billion, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 36%. Our tax rate is expected to approximate the blended U.S. federal and state rates. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $4.11 to $4.18 based on approximately 309 million shares outstanding. Zoom is dedicated to maintaining a careful balance between growth and profitability. We remain committed to innovating our platform, optimizing our go-to-market motions and evolving our culture to meet the dynamic needs of the market. We are confident that our continued investment in innovation will enable us to provide an even greater value to our customers, while also positioning us for sustained growth. Thank you to the Zoom employees, our customers, our community and our investors. Kelcey, please queue up our first question. Yes. Thank you. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we started really focusing on driving efficiencies across the business in Q4, as you saw in the results. This came from looking across all third-party spend and then as we moved into Q1, of course, the reduction. And so it's really a combination of that as well as looking across all of our business processes, including go-to-market where there's a restructuring happening to really focus the resources on our enterprise customers and be as efficient as we can in our commercial and small business teams. Thank you, Michael. I don't think there is any argument against deploying our cash, certainly to continue to advance our technology, advance our customer base. As I said, we are constantly looking for opportunities. And as I've mentioned in the past, we have kind of 3 main criteria, of course, we look at. We look at the technology as we want to make sure that we would be providing our customers something that works as well as the core of Zoom does today the core Zoom platform. We look at the culture to make sure that the organizations could come together very, very well. As you know, we take culture so seriously here. And Eric and the whole executive team have spent a lot of time focusing on building that. And then last but certainly not least, is valuation. And that has been tricky in the past. We've seen great assets that we love. We just couldn't get there as, unfortunately, all of you know. And so we now see that becoming easier and easier. So I will tell you that Sanjay and his team have been very busy continuing to look for targets for us, and it certainly is a part of our strategy that we're considering for FY '24. We're not going to get into the specifics around the reduction. I will tell you, it was pretty consistently applied across the company, the 15% that Eric mentioned, across the organizations as well as U.S. and some of our other locations outside of the U.S. So you can take that into consideration as you're calculating what you think the savings are. Yes. I guess, I don't know that I would say -- I mean, remember on the Q3 call, we weren't specifically giving guidance. We were trying to help sort of give, I think, a little bit of visibility, but we were still right in the midst of doing our FY '24 planning. So as we continue to work on that with all of the go-to-market teams and also made this decision around the team and the reduction, putting all of that together came up with what we've now guided to. And we do continue to see headwinds that we spoke about. Of course, currency is still a challenge, and we're going to see some -- as compared to year-over-year, we're going to see some impact in Q1 because remember, the dollar really started to strengthen the back half of Q1 last year. So you should expect to see some year-over-year impact there as well as just these changes in -- especially the go-to-market teams right now, making sure that we get everybody lined up and looking at where that is. But all of that was considered as we set the FY '24 guidance. Sure. We have announced a price increase for our online customers that we will be effective. I believe the date is March 1, as we announced it last -- earlier this month, and we believe that reflects -- and that's only for monthly customers, not for annual customers. And we believe that starts to reflect the value, as you said, that we have created for our customers over the last few years it's been many, many, many years, it predates me since the last time there was a price increase. And then on the Enterprise side, we did a pricing update all-inclusive with Zoom One, the bundle that we came up with last year. And we believe that really reflects the best way for our customers to buy and to get full value out of the platform. And that considers all of the products that are included and what we feel is an appropriate price point at this time. Yes. That's right. Tyler, we're always focused on being as efficient as possible in our gross margin. And you've seen -- we said we expect to be 79.5% for next year, which is right on top of our long-term target margins. In terms of our operating margins, we want to always watch for opportunities for investment in top line is that's really what we are driving for. So we will continue to make these decisions and watch for opportunities throughout the year if we see opportunities to invest in go-to-market, maybe channel programs, anything that we can do to drive top line growth, that would be our first priority. But as we said in the prepared remarks, we're going to balance that with profitability. So we're certainly committed to the guidance that we set, I don't think we're committing to expanding beyond that today. As again, our first priority is continuing to accelerate through go-to-market efficiencies as well as continuing to expand our product portfolio. So in terms of the expectations for online this year, they are consistent with what we've been saying for the last couple of quarters, which we expect it to stabilize during mid next year from a dollar amount, meaning starting to see the -- we've seen it continue to decline quarter-over-quarter from a dollar perspective for the last probably five or six quarters. And when we get kind of like Q2 to Q3 of next year, we expect to see that start to stabilize, which is great. When you look at all the initiatives that are in place. And then -- I'm sorry, the last part of your question about renewals was about? Yes. So renewals were not, right? There's always an opportunity to talk to our Enterprise customers around Zoom One, the platform bundle, which we think is a great opportunity for our enterprise customers to help our prospects and customers understand the full features of the platform. And then, of course, there is a natural opportunity to do that as they're going through the renewal period. And as we guided, we expect renewals to be strong in Q1. However, there is going to be that impact of currency that we've already experienced for Q2 through Q4. But unfortunately, we have one more quarter against the previous year comps that there's going to be some impact and some headwinds there. Yes, this fiscal year, yes. For FY' 23. Not FY '25. No. Thank you, Sterling. So we expect renewals -- we talked about renewals over the last year, the last 12 months, and we expect them to consider -- continue at kind of the same rate. And what we've mentioned in the past is that we have seen some contraction in seats as organizations around the world are experiencing reductions. So working with them on that. But on the other side, the opportunity to really bring a lot of value to our customers through our total cost of ownership, which includes expansion of the total portfolio. So as you saw, Phone really, really resonating very well, especially in this economy. And Contact Center, while it's still small, small from an absolute dollar perspective, it doubled the ARR for contact center doubled from Q3 to Q4. So again, small relative dollars, but really exciting to see it coming into its own. And that -- we expect that to continue to contribute through all of this year, but then really start to accelerate from a contribution perspective in FY '25, and I do mean FY '25 in that comment. And then, of course, there's Zoom IQ for Sales as well, which is on kind of a similar trajectory in terms of contact center, that small dollar contribution, but accelerating in terms of its overall growth. I think what's amazing and really interesting about Zoom One is it's not just new customers that are buying the Zoom One bundle, it's existing customers as well that are upgrading. And as a reminder, it includes Zoom Meetings, but also Zoom Phone. It includes Team Chat and Whiteboard. So really starting to see customers embracing the full effects of the platform. We have a Fortune 10 customer now that is a long-standing customer of ours that moved on to the Zoom One bundle and has standardized on Zoom Team Chat, which we're super excited to see. So that's the example of what starts to happen when these customers are really exposed to the full value of the platform that we can bring to them. And I don't know exactly the percentage of how it broke out in Q3 -- Q4, but it is really starting to take the lead in terms of how our enterprise sales teams are selling. Anything you want to add, Eric? Sure. So one thing to remember, Kash, is that while we are expecting the online portion of the business to stabilize from a dollar perspective during the year, it is still down year-over-year because of what happened in FY '23, where it was much higher. The dollar amounts were much higher in those earlier quarters as it came down. So we still have the unfortunate impact of the online segment of the business tamping down the growth of the Enterprise business. And so that's what you're seeing reflected there. And so the stabilization that occurs this year will really help as we look forward to next year, which we've always said is sort of reacceleration to the back half of this year into FY '25. And that's what we see in our internal models today. Well, there's the combination, first of all. Online is still down year-over-year. And so you're not going to start to see the year-over-year stabilization of online until the back half of -- even though the dollars are stabilizing, right, the year-over-year comparables are still down until the very back half of this year. And then while we've seen all the strength we've talked about on Zoom One and Zoom Phone, part of the expected growth is coming from these other newer products that are still -- so they're doing great, all positive indicators, but they're still early in their trajectory. But if you remember and think about how where Zoom Phone was in its second year of life, that's where Zoom Contact Center and to Zoom IQ for Sales. And now you see Zoom Phone, which is about to turn 4, I believe, how it's really contributing. So we've just got a little time ahead to get those products maturing and really contributing. So remember, for Q1, there is the definite impact of being three fewer days, which has real impact as compared to three fewer days of rev rec as well as the impact of currency, which we didn't have last year. So that year-over-year impact is going to definitely be visible in Q1 of FY '24. And then we continue to see in the Enterprise, elongated sales cycles, deal scrutiny, I was sort of lapping with a fellow CFO saying, this is the year of the CFO because I have gotten invited to speak at more sales kickoffs this year than you can imagine because every sales team is having to learn how to sell to the CFO and including ours. And that is exactly the experience that we're having. And so it just means they're taking a little bit longer and everybody is being very, very thoughtful about their purchases. And so all of that was taken into consideration as we set our full year guidance. I definitely think there is a question as to the state of the economy. And when it comes to investments, while we think we are incredibly well positioned with our total cost of ownership and the value that we bring to our customers, everybody is being very cautious until there's better visibility about the potential of a recession or not and where we're going to come through this. And we expect that could impact us at least through the rest of this year. It really depends on the customer. The thing that I would point out, though, is it's not just the uplift in the dollar amount. It's the retention that we see, which is really important to us as customers that have more -- I remember at Analyst Day, we showed that chart that like -- I can't remember exactly what it is more than 50% improved retention rates when they have more than one product deployed. And so the value of us having a broader platform in there, including the one that is much more intensive like Zoom Chat and Zoom Phone really brings a lot of value to us. Given that we are a cash tax payer for here to eternity now, I think you're likely to see it be slightly under, but what we're getting back to, which was very disruptive last year is a more normalized relationship between those two as we're on more of a normal force now from a cash tax perspective. In terms of when it's going to become 10%, it's sometime -- September early this year in FY '24 and we are very excited about the momentum. We had a 100% year-over-year growth in the product. And you get it's back to -- even in this economy and especially in this economy, companies looking for opportunities to standardize on 1 vendor and also because there is a lot of value to be gained by getting rid of those on-prem servers as well as the very disruptive price point that we have, all the way around, it's just proving to be very, very attractive. And as Eric mentioned, there's still a lot of opportunity in market available. So we expect that to continue. I don't know it's going to expect -- just to remind everybody, Q2 and Q4 tend to be our really peak quarters in terms of Zoom Phone adds. So while we had an amazing number of additions in Q4, I don't expect that necessarily to be the new bar. We expect to be seasonally down in Q1, but still very excited, but the momentum continues to be up and to the right. In terms of M&A, we look at both. We've been very successful in the past by buying those technology tuck-ins to accelerate our development, as you've seen with the Saudi acquisition, which has been a great accelerant for us in terms of Contact Center and continue to look at those, but also looking at other areas that there might be leaders in the space that makes sense for us. So we're continuing to look at both. And we -- every quarter, we talk to our Board about our capital allocation strategy. And of course, M&A is at the top of the list. We do not, as you indicated, have a buyback authorization in place today. We will continue to look for opportunities to deploy our capital in the best way possible for our investors. And right now, we -- again, as I said earlier, our #1 focus is reaccelerating top line growth and making sure that we have the flexibility to do that if opportunities arise. And so that's why, for the moment, we've decided to hold at least on requesting an authorization for a buyback. Bye, everybody."

            "name": "Eric Yuan",
            "content": "Wow, that's amazing. Thank you, Tom. And thank you everyone for joining us today. So FY23 was truly a pivotal period in our evolution into a full collaboration platform. As you saw in the video, we launched multiple innovations to help transform work and expanded our product portfolio to open new markets. Since Zoom Contact Center's release early last year, we have worked hard to expand its features, functionality and integrations. In Q4, we landed a 2,000 seat contact center deal, our largest to date, it truly demonstrated the rapid progress we have made towards becoming a full-fledged contact center solution. The success of our Zoom One bundle, which we launched last June, contributed to the strong performance of Zoom Phone, which in Q4 exceeded 5.5 million seats, making us a clear leader in the space. We closed out the fiscal year with the release of Zoom Virtual Agent, an intelligent conversational AI and chatbot solution that we believe will transform the way businesses assist their customers and employees. FY23 was not without its challenges. We experienced headwinds in terms of currency impact, online contraction, and deal scrutiny which continued into Q4. And a few weeks ago, we made the very tough but necessary decision to reduce our team by 15% and say goodbye to around 1,300 hardworking, talented Zoom colleagues. I want to extend to them my heartfelt appreciation and deepest gratitude for their crucial contributions to Zoom. This painful exercise has been a tremendous learning experience for us. It allows us to look inward to reset ourselves, so we can weather the economic environment with greater focus and agility, deliver for our customers and achieve Zoom's long-term vision. Now, let me discuss our strategic focuses in FY24 and beyond. First, we'll help redefine teamwork through offering new immersive experiences that improve employee engagement and modern collaboration tools for ideation across locations and modalities. And we will give teams everything they need through a single pane of glass. Second, the age of AI and large language models has arrived and we want to empower smarter experiences and workflows that truly enable our customers to benefit from these transformational tools. By embedding AI into more workflows, we can provide our customers with richer, more actionable insights that empower them to work smarter and serve their customers better. Zoom IQ, Zoom Virtual Agent, as well as our translation, captioning, and meeting summary tools are just the beginning. We will layer more AI technologies into our products to truly help our customers maximize their ROI on our platform and thrive in this new era of computing Third, we will offer more and more departments tailored solutions to meet their nuanced digital transformation needs. We constantly solicit feedback not only from CIOs, but also heads of sales, customer experience leads and many other leaders across various industries. Zoom IQ for Sales was built in this collaborative fashion and has already added tremendous value to many sales teams. You can expect additional industry-specific and department-specific applications developed both by us and our third party partners.  All of this comes together as a collaboration platform that unites people to unlock their potential, enables more dynamic and intelligent experiences and allows us to reimagine productivity and work. As we navigate this period of technological and economic volatility, our role as a trusted partner providing best-in-class unified communications services has never been more crucial. Again this is a tremendous opportunity in front of us, and we are very confident that our strong foundation, ambitious vision and customer-centric culture will enable us to seize this opportunity and continue to lead the way in the unified communications and collaboration space. Now moving on to some of our customer wins. I want to thank Aramco, one of the world's leading integrated energy and chemicals companies, for establishing a strategic partnership with Zoom. This is a landmark multi-year partnership where we will provide a full-suite of collaboration services including Zoom Meetings, Team Chat, Phone, Events and Zoom Rooms. In addition, we will work together to build a data center in the region and explore the joint development of innovative technology solutions. We are so grateful that Aramco has chosen to partner with Zoom on their digitization strategy. I'd also like to thank NASDAQ, my favorite company, who has been a Zoom customer for several years. Recognizing Zoom's strong reliability, security and ease of use, they expanded to Zoom One, our all in one unified communications and collaboration bundle. As part of this expansion, NASDAQ will be deploying Zoom Phone and also adding capabilities like Translation and Advanced Whiteboard to their Zoom Meetings. I want to also thank Raymond James, a leading financial services company, for expanding their relationship with us by integrating Zoom Phone to their Zoom Meetings implementation for a more complete communications package. We are excited to work with Raymond James to provide a highly-reliable and secure system, enabling their employees to communicate, collaborate, and ultimately thrive in the hybrid work world. I want to also thank Barracuda Networks, which builds cloud-first, enterprise grade security solutions, for expanding with Zoom. A longstanding Zoom Meetings customer, Barracuda saw the value of having a single platform for all their communications needs, and upgraded wall-to-wall to Zoom One Enterprise Plus in Q4. In addition, Barracuda also chose Zoom IQ for Sales to enhance sales engagement and Zoom Contact Center to elevate the customer experience. Again, thank you Aramco, NASDAQ, Raymond James, Barracuda Networks, and all of our customers worldwide.  And before closing, let me express my warm welcome to Cindy Hoots for joining our Board of Directors. Cindy brings a wealth of experience and currently is the Chief Digital Officer and Chief Information Officer at AstraZeneca. We are so excited to work with her. I also want to welcome our new Chief Product Officer, Smita Hashim, who joins us from a seasoned executive career at Microsoft and Google. We are also super excited to work with her. And with that, I'll pass over to Kelly. Thank you. Sure. So yes, first of all, that's a great question about AI. I think your question about AI sort of reminds me of 1995, 1996, when Internet was -- the first wave of Internet revolution. I was so excited. That's why I moved to Silicon Valley, right, to embrace that first wave of revolution. And since then I was a stuck for real-time collaboration until today. I can tell you, speaking of AI, I'm as excited as 1995, maybe sorry I'm wrong, maybe more excited than 1995, 1996, given my engineering and product background. I think AI [Indiscernible] sort of faces a challenge; at the same time, also have a huge opportunity ahead of us, right? Given our strong innovation culture, I think AI can truly help Zoom, right, to evolve us -- to cut sort of part of the Zoom 2.0 journey, right? I think Zoom may be the AI-first company. Speaking of specifically features how to leverage AI. And even before we talk about ChatGPT and talk about all those AI, actually, we already invest having on AI, right? So some customers may not see that, right? Like noise reduction, even with background, a lot of things like that. Even recently, we announced a feature called Zoom Smart and Meeting Summary where we already leveraged GPT-3 to augment our ML to improve that experience. And we are going to double down and triple down on AI a lot of features like Virtual Agent or Zoom IQ for Sales, our chat solution, even [Indiscernible] as well, I think AI can truly empower everything we are doing here and will benefit the customers. Plus we are taking a very open approach. And we have our own AI engineers, a lot of talents working very hard and also are going to partner with other companies. OpenAI is a great company and just plugged recently. And this is great. Again, I can talk a lot about AI. I'm very, very excited. So when it comes to money better to delegate it to Kelley, probably she is better to have managed that so. Yes, I think that's a good question. First of all, I don't think that we will depart -- it's departure to what are we trying to do before, so meaning more like an augment to whatever doing now. Because given a lot of new opportunities, I do not think everything should be done by our own developers, right? And that's why we also want to leverage the third party. I do -- not something tuning as a strategy, just more augment to what we're doing today. Yes, Kelly, please go ahead. I think -- great question. I think we sort of focused on both. I take Phone for example, the market potential is still huge. And we are doing extremely well and will help us more because given the product, very reliable as it's really innovation and better than any other phone service providers. That's why on core part, I see the huge growth opportunity. On to side of that, the new products Zoom Contact Center, Virtual Agent and Zoom IQ for Sales down the road, and more and more department of applications, in particular AI and is not a grid layer, I feel like a lot of new opportunity ahead of us. I think in the second half of this year, probably the transition period for us, given the -- we launched the Contact Center early last year, Zoom IQ for Sales as well. Although the new services, plus new services in the pipeline, I think, will help us. We need to focus on both. The reason why our real distributor are all-in-one collaboration platform, right? You can leave within a Zoom interface, can get most of work done, right? I think that that's our business. Yes, that's a great question. First of all, I would say, last year, we developed more than 1,500 features. I think our team worked extremely hard. But one thing we did not do well, I think we should improve -- read about the product adoption and say, after we finish the development features, we also need to remember customers may not know it. Again, this is something important for us this year. Having said that, a lot of customers in order to find a lot of good features, take NASDAQ for example, right? They would like to consolidate like meeting with a Whiteboard as well. It has a Whiteboard. They really like that, right? And also now the feature, we will also have a Team Chat, which is a precision chat solutions. We use that for many years, a lot of invest customers also deployed. Why do they want to pay for other services off their phone wall. Zoom has a very scalable also very flexible, the grid and the Team Chat solution after they found that they tested, they also like that, right? They also doubled all those features. A lot of things like that, not to mention the sales department, right? And upsell Zoom IQ for Sales opportunity. Again, a lot of innovations but we need focus on product adoption, let the customer know that there's huge value from the Zoom platform, right? So that's something we need to focus on. And quite a few -- probably all use Zoom Team Chat. I can tell you, again, it's much better, Whiteboard as well. So anyway, a lot of features, innovations, we should focus on adoption. Yes, great question. So on product front, right? So we are -- we launched it early last year, right, almost one-year anniversary now. I think we are going to keep innovating and essentially, today, look at our -- the Contact Center customer, we just closed the 2,000 seat contact center solution, right? We tested everything well. Zoom Contact Center works very well, not only for the -- just -- like early last year, we won quite a few deals for internal IT helpdesk. This is for the support agent, right? A lot of features are already built in. I think the protocol front in adding any more and more features very quickly. I think we are doing very well. I have a huge confidence for our team -- product team. However, on the go to market side, I think we should have done a better job, to be honest with you, right? And because the buyer is different, right? The good news over the past 12 months, we learned a lot, working to sort of change our go-to-market strategy, right? And make sure all those traditional customers no matter which on-premise solution and deploy or other cloud contact center deployed, we should let them know, right? Zoom has very scalable contact center solutions like those third-party resellers, right, and also we need to change our go-to-market model for contact center because the product works so well. So that part, I think we need to focus on this year. No, that's great. Yes. Normally -- it is a great question. It comes from upmarket opportunities, right? And a lot of our SMB customers, they do not use like Whiteboard and some other cool features. As an Enterprise customer, given the economic uncertainty and challenged cost reduction, they would like to consolidate, right, into one platform, right? And most of the tool from a total window perspective. When you look at the Zoom product, they're trying to understand what kind of other services features they can leverage more and then also toggle with my Whiteboard and Team Chat, Contact Center, Zoom IQ for Sales, more and more upsell opportunity. This is a great time for those upmarket customers, especially commercial and enterprise customers, right? Because they already trust our brand. They know those services they're provided for example, they know we are doing innovating. They know our service will be better than others, why not deploy Zoom Whiteboard. This is a great example. So given this is the Phone question, maybe I should launch the ChatGPT, let it answer to your questions, it's better. So I might give you a fun answer. Well, anyway, I think monday.com interesting, right? Because the reason why I invest in -- a lot of our customers, they also -- especially in Europe, right, also deploy the service, they would like them to integrate with us and also they're also Zoom customers as well. I think as far as I know. And I think it's more like from a customer perspective, right, the one -- also working together, right, to integrate with them, that's reason why I invest in them, right? Cvent, for example, during COVID, right, and a lot of customers deployed our Zoom and more Webinars and Zoom Events. And especially for those hybrid events, right, in-person events, we are more like a pure technology platform, right? We're also in some other components to help to make sure we have streamlined your events management. That's why we partnered with Cvent, right? We see the opportunity to further solidify our leadership, why not to invest in them. I think given now it's more a company we support hybrid work, I think Cvent -- I think they will do well. That's another reason why we invested in them, yes. So that's pretty much. Maybe my answer not as fun as the ChatGPT, but that's pretty much I can do. Thank you, all. Really appreciate you time. Love you, all. Thank you. Take care."

        "content": "Operator: Over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations. Tom, over to you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Kelsey. Hello everyone. And welcome to Zoom\u2019s Earnings Video Webinar for the Third Quarter of Fiscal 2023. I am joined today by Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, and Zoom\u2019s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.Zoom.us. Also, on this page you will be able to find a copy of today\u2019s prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2023. Our expectations regarding financial and business trends; impacts from macroeconomic developments and the Russia-Ukraine war, our market position, opportunities, growth strategy and business aspirations; and product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today\u2019s webinar. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Tom, and thank you everyone for joining us today. So last week, we hosted our first fully hybrid Zoomtopia using Zoom Events and it was great. We unveiled new innovations like Zoom Mail and Calendar, which enable users to frictionlessly navigate across their email, calendar and other Zoom products all within the same client. At Zoomtopia, many of our customers highlighted how they use our expanding platform to do more in the world of flexible work. At our first partner connect event, we hosted hundreds of channel partners, who are very excited about working with us to drive adoption of the Zoom platform globally. And our developer partners showcased add-on apps that connect interrelated workflows to the Zoom client. As global organizations adapt to how, when and where work happens, human connection remains paramount. Zoom is purpose-built to make all kinds of connections possible, effective and meaningful. We have developed and launched more than 1,500 features and enhancements on the Zoom platform this year, advancing how people connect with each other, their organization and their customers, ultimately, opening the doors wide for creativity and collaboration. Of course, even as we celebrate our innovations and customers, we still face the backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment. We continue to see FX pressure and heightened deal scrutiny for new business, but remain focused on delivering happiness to our customers by innovating our platform and expanding our go-to-market capabilities. Zoom provides a full suite of communications solutions at an attractive total cost of ownership that enables Teams to do more with less and our new products like Zoom Contact Center and Zoom IQ for Sales enable revenue generation and drive productivity. The continued strength of our Enterprise growth is a testament to how the value proposition of our platform resonates with customers even in tougher economic environments. As we enable customers to drive greater efficiency, we also are focusing on our own efficiency. We have always been judicious with investments, prudent about spending and we have commanded robust margins since our IPO, so this is not a major shift for us. We will continue to drive innovation, customer value and platform expansion, balanced with an increasing emphasis on efficiency and profitability. We continued to see strong traction with customers spending greater than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue, which was up 31% year-over-year. What\u2019s more, these customers are increasingly seeing value in buying the whole platform, with thousands of customers already buying Zoom One packages. From an industry perspective, the largest deals came from tech, media and financial services, and we also had notable wins in retail, transportation and pharma. On the tech front, let me first thank Qualtrics, the leader and creator of the Experience Management category, for expanding their partnership with us. Qualtrics recently upgraded to Zoom One Enterprise, which provides the full power of the Zoom platform to their users and allows them to make meaningful connections with Meetings, team chat, whiteboard, phone and more in one offering. We are delighted to offer Qualtrics a broad set of communications products integrated into one secure and easy-to-use platform. Our Enterprise segment comprises not only large publicly-traded companies, but also many private companies of all sizes, who see great value in enhancing their Zoom implementations by moving towards our full UC platform. Let me give you a few examples. First of all, I\u2019d like to thank Vensure Employer Services, a privately-owned professional employer organization for placing their trust in Zoom. In Q3, they added 5,500 Zoom Phone seats and 650 Zoom Contact Center seats demonstrating the promise they saw in adopting a modern, integrated solution for their teams to interact. Let me also thank Chime Solutions for establishing and already expanding their partnership with Zoom, which includes Zoom One and Zoom Contact Center. Founded with an unwavering focus on bringing jobs and opportunities to underrepresented communities, Chime Solutions delivers high-touch Contact Center solutions for mid-sized companies and Fortune 500 corporations. After seeing how well Zoom Contact Center addressed many of their customer\u2019s needs and gaining confidence in Zoom\u2019s ability to deliver innovation at a rapid pace, they decided to replace their legacy solution with Zoom Contact Center. Executing our innovation roadmap for Contact Center will give us the opportunity to further enhance our partnership with Chime Solutions in the quarters and years to come. I also want to thank G-P, the number one SaaS-based global employment platform, for choosing Zoom Phone to transform their communication systems and support employees across their organization. G-P understood the value of our integrated platform of communication products from their experience using Zoom Meetings, Zoom Webinars, Team Chat and Zoom Rooms. G-P ultimately opted for Zoom Phone, as the missing piece in their UC stack, in order to improve their customer\u2019s experience, while also enjoying the savings benefits of a cloud-based PBX solution integrated into a full communications platform. Also, I\u2019d like to add that G-P is Zoom\u2019s global expansion employment partner and has played a critical role in our growth strategy, giving us the agility and speed to enter new markets very quickly. Again, thank you Qualtrics, Vensure, Chime Solutions and G-P, and all of our customers worldwide. And with that, I will pass it over to Kelly. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric. Let me now turn to the quarter\u2019s results and guidance. In Q3, total revenue came in at $1.102 billion, up 5% year-over-year and 7% in constant currency. This result was approximately $2 million above the high end of our quarterly guidance. The growth in revenue was primarily driven by strength in our Enterprise business, which grew 20% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue, up from 49% a year ago. We expect Enterprise customers to comprise an increasingly higher percentage of total revenue over time. From a product perspective, we had strong growth in Zoom Phone coupled with contributions from Zoom Rooms and other products. At Investor Day earlier this month, we introduced a new metric, Online Average Monthly Churn. In Q3, this metric continued to improve to 3.1% from 3.7% in Q3 of FY 2022 and 3.6% last quarter. We are pleased that this metric has now returned to pre-pandemic levels. The number of Enterprise customers grew 14% year-over-year to approximately 209,300. Our trailing twelve month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q3 came in at a healthy 117%. We saw 31% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 3,286 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 27% of revenue, up from 22% in Q3 of FY 2022. Our Americas revenue grew 11% year-over-year. EMEA continues to be impacted by the stronger dollar, the Russia-Ukraine war and Online performance, which combined led to a decline of 9% year-over-year. APAC, which was also impacted by the stronger dollar, declined 3% year-over-year. Now turning to profitability, I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities, and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 79.5%, an improvement from 76% in Q3 of last year and 78.9% last quarter. The sequential improvement was mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our increasing number of co-located data centers. Given this, we expect our full year gross margin to be approximately 79%. Research and development expense grew by 59% year-over-year to approximately $108 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 9.8% from 6.4% in Q3 of last year. This reflects our ongoing investments in expanding Zoom\u2019s product portfolio and delivering on our customer\u2019s evolving needs. We expect to exit the year in the range of 10% to 12% of total revenue, consistent with our long-term target. Sales and marketing expense grew by 27% year-over-year to $301 million. This represented approximately 27.3% of total revenue, up from 22.6% in Q3 of last year. We continue to invest judiciously in sales capacity and channel partner expansion. G&A expense grew by 6% to $87 million or approximately 7.9% of total revenue, in line with 7.8% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $381 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $330 million, as we continue to thoughtfully prioritize investments. This translates to a 34.6% non-GAAP operating margin for Q3, as compared to 39.1% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.07, $0.24 above the high end of our guidance. Due to our share repurchase program, our Q3 weighted average share count has decreased year-over-year approximately 4 million shares to 302 million. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.4 billion, up 14% year-over-year from $1.2 billion. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $3.2 billion, up 32% year-over-year from $2.5 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 59% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 67% in Q3 of last year, reflecting a shift towards longer term contracts. As a reminder, our annual seasonality of renewals is front-end loaded and moderates over the rest of the year, reflecting the sequentially smaller renewal base. As such, we expect Q4 deferred revenue to grow at approximately 2% to 3% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. Year-to-date, we have purchased $991 million of our own stock, representing approximately 11 million shares. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $295 million, as compared to $395 million in Q3 of last year. Free cash flow was $273 million, as compared to $375 million in Q3 of last year. Our margins for operating cash flow and free cash flow were 26.8% and 24.7%, respectively. As previously discussed, this year we have seen larger cash outflows from an increase in cash taxes starting in Q2, which relate to the depletion of our NOLs and the lower tax deductions for stock-based compensation caused by the stock price decline. We now expect free cash flow to be at the high end of our range of $1 billion to $1.15 billion. As a reminder, our range assumes that the Section 174 tax legislation requiring capitalization of R&D expenses will be repealed or deferred by Congress by the end of this fiscal year. Now, turning to guidance. This outlook is consistent with what we are observing in the market today. Specifically, it assumes that our Enterprise business will grow in the low-to-mid 20s, while our Online business will decline approximately 8% for the year. For the fourth quarter of FY 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.095 billion to $1.105 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 3% year-over-year growth or 5% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $316 million to $326 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.75 to $0.78 based on approximately 301 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY 2023, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.37 billion to $4.38 billion, which at the midpoint represents approximately 7% year-over-year growth or 8.5% in constant currency. This represents a decrease of $15 million from our previous full year guidance, of which approximately $14 million is attributable to the continued FX pressure in Q3 and Q4. We now expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.49 billion to $1.5 billion, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 34%, which is an increase of $50 million or 1%, respectively, as compared to our Q2 guidance. Our tax rate is expected to approximate the blended U.S. federal and state rate. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $3.91 to $3.94, based on approximately 304 million shares outstanding. Zoom remains focused on thoughtfully balancing growth and profitability through platform innovation, customer value creation and partner ecosystem expansion. Thank you to the Zoom team, our customers, our community and our investors. Kelsey, please queue up our first question.\nOperator: Thank you, Kelly. [Operator Instructions] And of course, our first question is going to come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much for the question and congrats on the quarter. Maybe just sticking with the Online business for a second and kind of the stabilization of that business. Clearly, you saw the churn statistics improve. But just wanted to get a sense of how you guys are thinking about stabilization there, how you guys are thinking about just initiatives on new adds, as well as just free topaid conversion? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we -- as we shared at Analyst Day a few weeks ago, we\u2019re really happy with the continued improvement in the churn, first of all, and it improved even further in Q3. And the fact that now 70% of those cohorts have moved beyond that 16-month period in which they really see stabilization and we continue to see that happen. Wendy and her team are really focused on continuing to look at initiatives for conversion. Those include things like adding local currencies, adding local payment types, as well as looking at packages that make sense. So all of that is still in process, and what we\u2019re thinking and we had talked about before is we expect Online to stabilize from a dollar perspective in Q2 of next year and based on our most recent forecast, that is still the case.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Moving on to Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Thank you very much. I will have my congrats. A very nice free cash flow performance. I wanted to ask you, Eric, the pace of warranty activity is so rapid at the moment. To what extent do you anticipate that perhaps some of the new product innovations and I am thinking of Zoom Mail, Calendar, Zoom Spots and others could perhaps enhance the stickiness of the usage patterns, right, or drive engagement and collaboration higher in a way that could maybe benefit your -- either your dollar retention rates or maybe some of the premium plan adoption?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So, Mark, that\u2019s a great question. That\u2019s the reason why we had a very successful Zoomtopia, because we announced so many innovations, almost every innovation. When we look at that what we can do to either add value to the existing paid customer to focus on stickiness or maybe the potential revenue opportunity, right? Look at area features, I think, we always follow that principle. Look at Email and calendar, look at Online paid users, the subscribers and we do not offer to free users, right? For all those Online, the pro buyers give Email, Calendar for free, they can use the Email, Calendar full [Indiscernible] another great service, which is an [Indiscernible], right? Look at all other features, like, Spots and all those features certainly can help our integrated customers also make our services more sticky. Not only do they use Zoom for schedule Meetings, but also can use that to mimic the office environment. So for free users, right, [Indiscernible] Email, Calendar, [Indiscernible] Spots client, right? So every feature [Indiscernible], I think, for sure, will add more value to our customers, either drive stickiness or drive potential revenue opportunity like Zoom IQ, virtual agent and the Contact Center and virtual agent, Zoom IQ like virtual coach and a lot of features like that. So we are very, very excited, and again, and the feedback from customers are very, very positive and they are very excited about adopting those new features and enhancements.\nMark Murphy: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Credit Suisse, Fred Lee has the next question.\nFred Lee: All right. Thank you for taking my question. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the macro impact on Phone adoption and maybe give us an update on Zoom Phone adoption overall as you have over the past couple of quarters?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we continue to see strength in Zoom Phone. As a reminder, we announced on the last call that we had crossed over the 4 million seat mark. We also added nine customers in Q3 that have purchased over 10,000 seats and that brings us to a total of 64 customers in that category. So I think it shows continued strength, especially in the up market even in these challenging economic times. So we\u2019re excited about the prospects that we continue to see there and as we keep promising you all, we will break it out when it gets 10% of revenue. So you will be able to see that then a little more clearly.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. Fred, to add on to what Kelly said, more and more customers are increasingly looking at our Zoom platform, Zoom One UC platform, usually look at a [Indiscernible] product, phone or Meetings or webinar or team chat. Now look at a full UC stack, because that will give you a better experience in terms of the total ownership of cost is also much better. That\u2019s why more and more customers are moving towards our full, like, Zoom One platform and I am very excited about the opportunities there.\nFred Lee: Great. Thank you very much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Now moving on to Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. Appreciate you taking the question. On the front-end loaded renewal seasonality, you had a useful tidbit on the deferred revenue growth you are expecting in Q4. Can you just maybe walk through how you gear up for that as a company given it\u2019s a little bit outside the norm on general calendar cycles that we\u2019re used to seeing. What kind of visibility do you have into that cohort currently and is there anything you can do to shift that profile or is it just kind of gradual as this rolls forward and you have gotten just accustomed to it internally thus far? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So, as a reminder, this occurred, right, due to the significant increase of customers we had during Q1 in the early stages of the pandemic. And what has happened is due to the practice that we have internally of making it easy for our customers, we co-term when they add on additional products or expand their seat count, for example, so it\u2019s continued to actually exacerbate, if you will, when we\u2019re upselling customers that front-end loaded phenomenon. So it will start to level out over time as we see customers in Q2 and Q4 being our largest seasonal quarters due to the six-month quotas of our upmarket reps. But as you say, we are used to it now internally, everybody knows this is how it works. We are coming into, I guess, our third renewal period and we have seen strength in each of the last two cycles. So We are able to accommodate, we know how it works and it\u2019s just something we know that it\u2019s not aligned with most of the rest of the industry, which is why we keep reminding you and trying to give you as much color as possible around that.\nMichael Turrin: Appreciate that. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKash Rangan: Hello. Thank you very much. Happy Thanksgiving in advance. Good to see you, Eric and Kelly. I had a question on the Enterprise business. I think most of us on the call basically were waiting for the tilt where the Enterprise business will -- the strength of the enterprise business can offset the weakness in the Online business. As we wait for that, I am curious to get your take on the expansion rate. I think it came in at 1-17% or so. And the number of customer -- it used to be higher in prior quarters, the number of net new adds on the Enterprise still also not quite rebounding and recovering. Can you give us some perspective on how much of it is macro versus maybe competition from the likes of Teams, et cetera. And Eric, how does this play out into the broader adoption thesis for the Zoom platform. When are we likely to see these metrics inflect the other way that could validate your overall thesis that Zoom is not just about video Meetings, but a broader communication platform? Thank you so much.\nKelly Steckelberg: Eric, do you want to talk about Zoom One first and then I will talk about the metrics after that.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. Sure. Absolutely. So, Kash, that is a good question. And you look at the customer projects, right, as we move towards the Zoom One platform, right? So and leverage our full usage stack started from Meetings many years ago. They added a phone, webinar, team chat and so on and so forth. I think the problem was that previously when it comes to Zoom, everybody probably assume that is to be compressing and that\u2019s not the case. That\u2019s why we are doubling down our Zoom One marketing awareness, also talk to the customers that we understand, not only do we offer the best with content service, but also if you look at our other offerings that\u2019s a full UC stack and also have Contact Center as well. I think that will take a little bit of time. But as long as customers really like, wow, Zoom has a full stack, Enterprise also have a very flexible team chat plus this is free. It works so well, integrated other UC solutions, I think customers are showing a great excitement about adopting the full UC platform. And more and more customers are moving towards our full UC stack rather than just the Meeting or Phone and that\u2019s why we are very excited. Because if you look at all those offerings working together seamlessly and in terms of total orders costs much better, because many interest customers are trying to consolidate their full UC that. UC stack and client stack is different, but we might use a Email or Calendar or SharePoint or the Office from other vendors. But in terms of UC stack, they want to deploy the best, good service. That\u2019s why we are going to win on UC stack plus download the CC as well.\nKash Rangan: Yeah. Thank you so much, Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: And Kash, just in terms of like your comment about renewals, I want to highlight, especially in the Enterprise renewals remain very, very strong. We were actually slightly ahead of our internal forecast for Q3. So we continue to see -- we have talked about many metrics, growth and expansion in The enterprise. It\u2019s just, as you say, we are waiting for that stabilization in Online to because right now, it\u2019s really having a dampening effect on the overall growth rate of the company.\nKash Rangan: Thank you, Kelly.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer has the next question.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Eric, maybe with all the Enterprise progress you are showing. Can you give us an update on Contact Center and the adoption that you are seeing there?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So, yeah, again, the Contact Center is a new service, We are very excited in particular for those customers who deploy our -- full service who would like to consolidate the UC and CC together. And also, we found interesting use cases, well, not only do those traditional customer interaction department, we started deploying the Zoom Contact Center, but also the internal IT desk as well, right? And again, the Contact Center seat cycle a little bit longer like the Meetings. But, however, we showcase our platform capability and the speed of innovation, customers are very excited. And plus, you look at our own business, right? And we used to deploying other cloud Contact Center solutions, also with [inaudible] our own Contact Center solutions, our teams themselves are very, very excited. And a lot of potential pipelines and leads right in the pipeline and also we are doubling that on that. And again, the product side, we have higher confidence. Go-to-market side, we are gaining attractions as quickly as possible, because again, it takes some time plus also leverage channel and internal go-to-market investment. And I think that\u2019s a future big revenue driver for us, especially customer like CC and UC together, right, and with a much better experience and also the total ownership of costs also much better.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Moving on to Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you. Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to ask about macro pressure, you talked about last quarter sales elongation on the Enterprise side. What kind of plans you are seeing, anything worsened and also how does that impact your pipeline as well?\nKelly Steckelberg: So we certainly have seen impact, as I mentioned, from FX of the reduced guidance of $15 million, $14 million of that is coming from FX pressure and you saw that certainly in our year-over-year growth in Europe and in APAC. In the Enterprise, again, renewals stayed strong, excitement about the products. But as we discussed, it\u2019s continued in terms of additional deal scrutiny, I think all of my peer CFOs now are looking at deals and that\u2019s just causing elongation in general not that things are losing, not that We are losing deals. They are just taking longer to get done and potentially some of them pushing over quarters. But we haven\u2019t seen that have impact. It\u2019s just taking longer and longer, not that they are going anywhere else. It\u2019s just taking longer to get those done. Now the good news is, right, especially with all of the new products, the consolidation that we offer is a really great value story for our customers in terms of elimination of additional vendors, getting rid of on-prem servers and that continues to be a great story that our customers love.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Siti.\nOperator: SVB Moffett, Sterling Auty has the next question.\nSterling Auty: Thanks. Hi, guys. Kelly, maybe following on that, I want to understand the 20% growth in Enterprise in the quarter versus the guidance of low-to-mid 20% for the full year, does that mean that there\u2019s a little bit of a back-end loaded hockey stick or a bump up that we will see next quarter. And specifically, I think, investors are really interested in trying to gauge how should that business react as we move into next fiscal year in light of the concern about layoffs across all industries and a lot of your Zoom Meetings, et cetera, are based on per employee per seat pricing?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we certainly -- we have talked about this the last couple of quarters, have seen more and more of our deals shifting to the end of the quarter and taking on that more historically natural cycle that we didn\u2019t -- we haven\u2019t seen since really early in the pandemic, but that is absolutely the case for us and we have adjusted our forecast for Q4 for some of that linearity as well. We have continued to see, as I keep saying, strength in our renewals, and I think, that\u2019s because while there\u2019s concern about layoffs, there\u2019s this other phenomenon about flexible work, right? Everybody wants to continue to working in the way they become accustomed to. And as long as employers are supporting that and their employees it really means everybody needs a Zoom license. If you are out of the office, even 1 day a week, you need that Zoom license for phone, for Meetings, for what Zoom One. And so I think that is really compelling reasons for organizations to continue to renew with them.\nSterling Auty: Understood. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. Thank you, Sterling. If I could\u2026\nOperator: And moving -- oh, apologies, Eric. You may proceed now.\nEric Yuan: Even for those businesses, right, after before the full UC stack, look at the team chat is getting more and more popular. And also the founder also can use that for their personal use cases as well, right, because that\u2019s free. That\u2019s why a lot of tractions for other parts of our entire UC platform.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Funk with Bank of America. Michael, video for us. All right, Michael, if you can hear us, please go ahead start your video and come off mute to ask your question. I am hearing\u2026\nEric Yuan: Yeah. Michael.\nOperator: Hearing no response, we will go ahead and move on to William Power with Baird. And William, if you wouldn\u2019t mind doing the same thing. Great. Thank you so much.\nWilliam Power: Great. Thanks for taking the question. Probably for Kelly, a pretty notable increase in stock-based compensation expense. I know you talked about this at the Investor Day to that you expected given top-ups to be more elevated. But it would be great to just get a little more perspective as to how you are thinking about that going forward, is this closer to a peak level, should -- it will stay at this level? Maybe over a longer term time frame, how investors should expect that to trend? And I guess kind of tied to that, you have been aggressive on the stock buyback front, what are the plans there going forward and how could that tie in and how you think about stock-based compensation?\nKelly Steckelberg: So, first, we believe that the Supplemental Grant program is really important for the strategy of the company in terms of retaining our employees and keeping them focused and not having to worry about that. And the Supplemental Grants vest over the same period as the underlying grant that they are tied to. So you are going to see this level continue for a few years as those grants are vesting through and many of them originally were four-year grants, so they have two years or three years left in which you are going to see that stock-based comp as those underlying shares are vesting. With the stock, once the stock stabilizes then you will see less impact from that or less need for additional grants. So we are hoping that we are at that place and that you are going to not see additional Supplemental Grant in that same level. But until we get past probably another year\u2019s worth, we might have some more. In terms of the repurchase, as you heard, we purchased $991 million, so or 11 million shares. So we have a little bit of room with that and once we have completed that, we will evaluate whether or not we want to ask the Board for authorization. We haven\u2019t done that yet.\nWilliam Power: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will now hear from Matt Stotler with William Blair.\nMatt Stotler: Hi, there. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just one more on the Online business. It would be great to maybe get some color, some commentary on the economics of that business, the margin profile as it compares to the Enterprise segment of the business and what the implication there is as that revenue mix continues to shift, specifically in the context of the updated long-term figures you gave us a couple of weeks ago.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we have talked about this before, our Online business is a higher margin business as it\u2019s largely, not completely, but largely untouched by any person from a sales organization. There are some Online account executives that are there to answer questions. But it\u2019s minimal compared to our Enterprise sales organization. So we certainly took -- we have done a lot of work on modeling what that looks like a and we have taken that into consideration as we laid out our long-term margins that we shared with you at Analyst Day as we look forward for the next several years and how we think the mix could shift between the underlying the Online, sorry, Online and Enterprise businesses.\nMatt Stotler: Got it. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: Moving on to Ryan Macmilly, my apologies, Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Ryan.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks so much. hey. Follow up on Matt\u2019s question. Kelly, can you hear me?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. Hi.\nRyan MacWilliams: Yeah. Probably all perfect. You previously noted a potential inflection in the Online business early-to-mid next year. With churn now right at around pre-pandemic levels, but we are still seeing revenue declines sequentially in this segment. Any updates as potential inflection and also is there any impact from existing Zoom customer\u2019s upselling to Enterprise on this Online business segment? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, yeah, the answer is yes. There are customers that eventually upsell into Enterprise, which is great, right, because that means they are expanding and they are becoming a bigger customer overall, which we love to see, but that does then, I mean, it\u2019s not company churn, but it looks like it\u2019s moving out of the Online business into the Enterprise. And in terms of -- the way We are talking about it is a stabilization of Online and we expect that from a dollar perspective to still happen in Q2 of next year, based on our current forecast that We are seeing.\nRyan MacWilliams: Got it.\nOperator: I am moving on to Parker Lane with Stifel.\nParker Lane: Yeah. hi. Thanks for taking the question. Kelly, you referenced thousands of customers that have signed up for Zoom One since it launched, I believe, about five months ago. Can you help me understand the profile of those customers a little bit better? The majority of them tend to be existing customers that have been migrated onto Zoom One new packaging or are you seeing a big net new cohort as well? And then two, is it skewing more Enterprise for customers that are thinking about going with Zoom One or are you also seeing a pretty decent spread across all different size organizations? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, Eric, I know you love to talk about Zoom One. Do you want to talk about it for a second just\u2026\nEric Yuan: Yes. Sure. Exactly. I think that -- first of all, I think, Parker, you look at our Zoom One, we launched several months ago, right? And look at all those customers, minimum-sized, Enterprise, SMB, they also see the value, that\u2019s why we see and almost every market we are talking, they are moved towards the Zoom One package, so they do see the value. But you not see any test markets that the segment truly standing out from all the way from SMB to device and I think that\u2019s exactly what we anticipated.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric. I would just add to that, that the key customer wins that we saw in Zoom One in Q3 were a pretty balanced mix of new, as well as customers that are upselling as they are adding new products to the portfolio, so We are really happy about that, that We are seeing traction in both aspects of the business.\nParker Lane: Understood. Thanks again.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: We will now hear from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securites.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yes. Thank you very much. So I\u2019d like to hear from you what you think your current visibility is compared to, say, three months ago. I noticed that your RPO grew by 32% year-to-year, which is impressive. But you also had a decline in your CRPO percentage over the past several quarters, your expansion rate has been declining and with your guidance for deferred revenue to grow 2% to 3% with my model and getting billings down 10% year-to-year in Q4 and you have never really had a billings decline in my model. So just talk about the visibility you have right now versus three months ago and when you think you might see this stabilize? Is it a few quarters or is it a few years? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So the current RPO pressure is largely related to the Online customers and the decline that you are seeing in Online as the long-term RPO really benefits from the direct and -- or the Enterprise side of our business, which are managed by the direct business and have more annual and multiyear contracts. That\u2019s kind of why you see that shift in terms of the overall percentage. I would say and then the other impact that We are having that we can\u2019t -- which is difficult to predict, of course, is FX, right? So you have to consider that, which is more concentrated Online than an Enterprise, but you heard we in our guidance that we have reduced, we said about $14 million of that, we believe to be attributable to FX. In general, I would say, the economics or the state of our business hasn\u2019t changed. Meaning, our Enterprise business and our Enterprise sales organization is stable. They are continuing to operate in the same way. The Online business with the improvement in churn, as well as the way that the majority of it now has shifted out along beyond the 15 months is really helpful in terms of our ability to forecast that business. And so I think the visibility is the same, there\u2019s just some different reasons for all those different components that you are talking about. The deferred is -- again, the decline you are seeing in Q4 is really due to the front-end loaded nature of our business. And then remember, so the front-end billing, sorry, the renewals happen at the front-end of the year, that\u2019s where you are going to see the upswing in billings, the upswing in deferred and then that gets amortized over the years, so deferred\u2019s coming down and then we have much lower renewals in Q4 as well. So the renewals that are filling up the bucket are much, much smaller. So it\u2019s -- you mentioned many factors and there\u2019s different reasons for all of those.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yeah. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Peter Levine with Evercore.\nPeter Levine: Great. Thank you for taking my question. I think given some of your customers are pushing back on launch of decisions, are you able to kind of toggle your sales force being focused more on those back-to-base opportunities. And then, Kelly, just a follow-up, can you share how many of those 9 -- I think you said 9,000, 10,000 phone customers or net new to Zoom and then maybe just share were these legacy PBX replacements or are you going in and replacing another cloud provider? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So, first of all, remember, our strategy for selling Zoom Phone is selling into existing -- in the existing installed base. So I don\u2019t know actually a split between those 9, but I am sure that the majority of those were existing Zoom customers. And I think I would say, there\u2019s a focus on the company that, as Eric has talked about of expanding not beyond, not to just phone, right, but expanding to the full platform. So that\u2019s really what we have our teams focusing on now. It\u2019s Zoom One, it\u2019s Contact Center, it\u2019s Zoom IQ for Sales. Now it\u2019s Email and Calendar and really thinking about that complete platform, including Zoom Chat and the adoption within organization. So it -- for all the reasons we have been talking about in terms of retention, flexibility for organizations to reduce vendors, the cost savings, the total cost of ownership that they see by having that combined that for all of those reasons, that\u2019s really becoming the focus of our Enterprise sales organization.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey. Thank you for taking the question. I wanted to ask, you mentioned the greater value that customers are seeking out from the broader platform. I am just wondering, are there specific areas where you see maybe more room to strengthen the platform and with the compression we have seen in market valuations, how are you thinking about potential inorganic opportunities? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, Eric, do you want to talk about the platform and the value they see.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. Sure. Absolutely. I think for those customers, right, who deploy Zoom One platform, right? They really like it. The reason why you look at the when same client, the same interface, right? And if you have a scaled meeting, you can use our Zoom team chat, communicate with our teammates and customers, make a phone call, white board is there, now we added Email and Calendar fully integrated together. I think that\u2019s the whole lot. And plus, if you look at the customer, we used to be deploying many other partners solutions, always one platform on the full UC stack. That is value a seamless experience and that\u2019s why more and more customers no matter which other cloud business solutions they deploy, for example, we deploy other cloud business solutions not realize the full value of the entire Zoom One platform, we see more and more end customers, they just reach out to us rather than they reach out to Zoom to update. Now they reach out to us. We say, yeah, I see the good value and that\u2019s why more and more innovations will be built upon the Zoom One platform. And yeah, like, Zoom Spot, We arecently announced and that\u2019s our focus to double down our platform story.\nMatthew Niknam: And just in terms of inorganic opportunities\u2026\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nMatthew Niknam: \u2026 if you can elaborate on that?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. Sure. So we continue every day to look at opportunities, and yes, the compression evaluation certainly is not lost on us. What We are always trying to balance, of course, is what would it bring to our customers, what would it bring or the impact potentially on our culture and then, of course, the value and the state of the technology, right? We have a high bar for both talent and technology here at Zoom. So it\u2019s been difficult, I would say, to date to find something that really meets all of those standards. Eric is a very hard judge, but that doesn\u2019t mean that We are stopping and we continue to look for opportunities every.\nEric Yuan: Also, in terms of the full platform experience that I mentioned, our customer, the number one thing they like in our experience. Let\u2019s say, if you look at the other biggest service provider, right? How to make sure you have a consistent experience, that\u2019s not an easy. That\u2019s why we tend to look at all those greater technology companies like Solvvy, we acquired many years ago. Again, if you want to just the focus on the branded new service, we might think about the inorganic opportunity. But now look at the UC platform, we already did everything. Now We are just focus on the go-to-market side, right? And we are -- we have a high confidence like We are getting more and more traction there, so.\nMatthew Niknam: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Moving on to Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Just maybe I have one question that it\u2019s a bit forward, it\u2019s a bit hard. But if I look at the -- kind of the Shebly\u2019s point, the forward looking metrics and the implicit guide for Enterprise revenue next quarter is about 15% to maintain that low 20s for the full year. If you go forward a second, it does look like growth next year is going to be kind of in the low-to-mid single digits, assuming the normalization or stabilization of the Online business and assuming some further decel with the macro getting tougher. With OpEx growing nearly 30% this year, what -- how are we thinking about a worsening environment, like, what\u2019s the recession playbook for Zoom. We have seen some companies take some pretty meaningful steps with respect to employees, with respect to dialing up, if you will, the efficiency of the business, what\u2019s the plan -- what\u2019s the recession plan here maybe for both you and Eric?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So I think that your assessment in terms -- We are not giving -- we just may be caveat first of all, We are not giving FY 2024 guidance on this call. We will do that obviously at the Q4 call. But your assessment in the way you are kind of thinking about the topline growth is right in line with kind of how We are thinking about it right now. And in terms of then from an operating margin perspective, the way We are thinking about it is, as We are working on our FY 2024 plan, we are being very, very thoughtful about prioritization of investments. It\u2019s how I would say it. And as you noted, we have grown our expenses and we have hired a lot this year, and so being very thoughtful about ensuring that they are focused on the right things that we are prioritized internally. We are committed to continuing on innovation and meeting our customer\u2019s needs, as well as go-to-market expansion. Those are really the top priorities that we have and making sure that we have resources in the right areas for that. I guess that\u2019s what I would say.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So, Alex, I think, We are a much better position. You look at the efficiency and the potential productivity improvements like cash flow profitability and plus we had, as Kelly mentioned, we had a lot of teams this year. I think that they are going to reach full productivity next year. That\u2019s why I think, yeah, I think we can weather the storm, right? And for any either short-term or long-term or short or long recession, and yeah, we feel very confident to drive efficiency and productivity.\nAlex Zukin: And I guess maybe just as a follow-up. If I look at the buyback cadence given on the one side, Kelly, if you are talking about having to issue shares as long as the stock goes down, on the other side, you have $5 billion in cash on the balance sheet to buy back stock. So how do we -- because I get a lot of questions about dilution, particularly given the supplemental share buyback. So at least on that front, what\u2019s the right way to think about over the next year, over the next two years, three years, how -- ex-M&A, how you are going to leverage that cash balance?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we think based on the share repurchase program that we have had -- we currently have in place, we have done a good job of being able to offset the dilution from the supplemental shares. We want to be very thoughtful about our cash those. We just talked about M&A for example. And so especially as We are focusing on our FY 2024 plan, our balancing the opportunity for managing dilution, as well as earnings on that cash and M&A opportunities. So all of those are being considered as we look forward for FY 2024 and that\u2019s really what we have to say today. We will have more to talk about when we come back for the Q4 call.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you guys.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: We will now hear from Ryan Koontz with Needham & Company.\nRyan Koontz: Thanks for the question. Can unpack the strength in Enterprise and how to think about that revenue growth across different product categories, if not quantitative, can you kind of give us an idea where phone stacks up versus expanded meeting license and any other products look like they can become meaningful in the next 12 months as you look at that on the Enterprise side? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So really happy with the progress we have seen with Zoom One, with Zoom Phones and the strength in Zoom Rooms in Q3. We also certainly see potential in Contact Center and Ryan Koontz, they are just so early. That from a -- We are seeing progress there and excitement, but it\u2019s early stages. So in terms of what they are contributing overall to the dollar amount, it\u2019s minimal at this point, but we are seeing growth in terms of quarter-over-quarter expansion in those products. So that\u2019s really exciting to see.\nRyan Koontz: Got it. Thanks. Thanks, Kelly.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Catherine Trebnick with MKM.\nCatherine Trebnick: Thank you for taking me -- my question. Appreciate it. One of mine is on your partner program. You brought in a new partner executive last July. Could you specify any particular areas that he\u2019s going to concentrate on to drive more revenue? He just interviewed one of the CRM magazines and said he wants to get to 50% revenue through the channel and can you just address some of the ideas that he has to implement.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, yeah, Todd, Catherine is referring to Todd, who joined us, I think, a couple of quarters ago, he\u2019s great. At Zoomtopia, he hosted our first partner connect with over 400 partners were there. So that was super exciting to see. And while there are lots of opportunities, I think, one of the biggest areas of opportunity is international partner expansion. We have done a good job over the last few years of building up master agents and carriers here in the U.S., but it\u2019s still relatively nascent outside the U.S. So that will be a big area of focus for sure.\nCatherine Trebnick: All right. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: And James Fish with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead with your question.\nJames Fish: Hi. Thanks for the question. Most of might have been asked, but I did actually want to ask on the Enterprise sales investment that we have been talking about the last is like a couple of years. How are you guys looking to balance productivity improvements to support your margin stability versus expanding capacity, especially as these reps over the last few years, really had the advantage of an easier sales cycle with Meetings especially. Is there any way to also understand the experience of reps underneath in terms of how much are fully productive at this point? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So in terms of our reps, we are constantly looking at opportunities to help make them more productive. And as you -- we were just talking about we have hired a lot over the last few years and as we look forward to FY 2024, we will be making many fewer hires. So We are really looking for how do we enable the reps, how do we make sure that we have the overlay teams in the right places to support them. As a reminder, that\u2019s -- we have specialists that are selling Contact Center and Phone and that\u2019s a really important aspect of making sure that everybody is aligned on serving our customers in the best way possible. So that is a big focus. We also have a new President, Greg Tomb, that you all met last quarter and he\u2019s been spending a lot of time helping us think about that, especially as We are moving up in the Enterprise stack, that\u2019s his experience, so where his background is. And then -- and really focusing on making sure that our comp plans aligned. That\u2019s another thing that We are taking a look at for FY 2024 as well.\nEric Yuan: And James, another big point just to add on to what Kelly said and also the Zoom IQ for Sales that product certainly added value to drive our team\u2019s productivity, right, especially when reps that work remotely, right, how to manage their productivity, drive efficiency, take some actions, right, quickly. I think we will deploy Zoom IQ for Sales by end of this month, literally every rep will be fully trained on Zoom IQ for Sales, right? Not only do we have our sales productivity and also we will create a lot of opportunity for us to sell more and more Zoom IQ for Sales. That\u2019s a future value for areas to drive productivity.\nJames Fish: Helpful. Thanks, guys.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks, James.\nOperator: Moving on to Matthew VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I guess you highlighted Zoom Rooms and curious how much of that uptick do you feel like has been sort of a return to office for a number of companies and really having that mixed modality of a conference room and still having remote workers in. And how much, I guess, sort of risk might that come under over the next several quarters of being a growth lever as we have seen layoffs, as we see a slower macro and maybe that\u2019s not an additive spend that the companies are going to want to undertake when they are already paying for the individual Zoom licenses? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. I think it\u2019s very similar to Zoom Meeting licenses in the aspect of as long as you have a hybrid workforce, you need the right technology in your conference room. Other -- to ensure that you have this inclusive experience that we have all become so accustomed to and we continue to listen to our customers, customers work on innovations to ensure that we provide that. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to go away. I mean we will see what happens, right? I think it\u2019s still yet to come to see what happens with like commercial real estate. However, Zoom Rooms and the importance of those in a hybrid workforce, I just -- I can\u2019t tell you how important that is. I can\u2019t stress enough the importance of that and that\u2019s really what our customers are seeing as well as they are in some sort of state of a hybrid work environment.\nMatthew VanVliet: Great. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: And also, Matt, another thing just quickly, so it used to be like you look at the conference room, right, most of the usage are used internal, right, for internal cost. Now look at the Zoom Rooms, that\u2019s not the case. A lot of customers are leveraging Zoom, right, talk to the customers and the partners, right? That\u2019s one difference, because that\u2019s the reason why customer like Zoom, right? When you talk with the customer partners, you want to make sure I have the best experience, right? And another thing even for those companies who might think about laying off employees and reduce number of the employees. Guess what? Less taxes, but more conference rooms. Then otherwise, what can you do, right, to double down our customer and partner, right? And that\u2019s why we still see the great opportunity ahead of us.\nMatthew VanVliet: Thank you.\nOperator: And we will move on to Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Hey. Thanks for taking my question. Kelly, in terms of the Q4 guide, I understand that currency was a bit of a factor there on the lower outlook. But can you just unpack kind of what you are assuming from a macro perspective? Is the Q4 guide relative to what was implied last quarter, is it incorporating churn getting worse in SMB or weaker net adds or maybe you are seeing something on the Enterprise side? Just help us understand the non-FX side in terms of what you are expecting for Q4.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So in the Online segment of the business for Q4, we expect churn to be pretty much in line with Q3. I mean it\u2019s likely that number is going to bounce around a little bit quarter-to-quarter and that\u2019s going to all be visible to you now as we report it, but we are not forecasting any dramatic changes there. And then in the Online segment, I would say that, the -- I mean, sorry, in the Enterprise segment, I would say, the biggest change that We are seeing is just this continued push to deals being at the back end of the quarter. And so that linearity -- over the last few years, we had a much more balanced linearity in our Enterprise segment and what that leads to, of course, is deals contributing to revenue in the quarter and We are seeing much less of that as these deals are going back to the more traditional back end, really, really back end of the quarter. Now we have the benefit in of having kind of the two periods of December 31st close and then the January 31st close, but we are expecting the linearity more consistent like with what we have seen in Q3 than what we saw a year ago.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: And we have time for one additional question from Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Karl.\nKarl Keirstead: Great. Thanks for fitting me in. Hey, Kelly. I\u2019d just love to ask you about the -- your perceived utility of the billings number. Traditionally, we look at that number as a decent proxy for business momentum. But, obviously, minus 10 in 4Q and plus 1% for the full year, I am guessing you would argue that that\u2019s a poor proxy for Zoom\u2019s momentum. So can you opine on that a little bit, because I think maybe there\u2019s some consternation about that negative 10% and 5% billings?\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Karl. I should have said this earlier. So as a reminder, we don\u2019t guide to billings we never have, because we don\u2019t think that they are a good indicator for us. Because of the large percentage of our customers that are, especially in the Online segment of the business that are on monthly contracts. And so because they bill and they pay us monthly, they don\u2019t show up in that number and so that\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t -- it isn\u2019t really a good proxy for you to use.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. And as a follow-up, Kelly, is there anything else that\u2019s skewing that DR number. Is there any change to invoicing terms or maybe more flexible payment terms to customers that maybe on the margin are impacting DR as well?\nKelly Steckelberg: Nothing significant.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay.\nKelly Steckelberg: It\u2019s really more about the timing -- you are talking about the deferred revenue specifically\u2026\nKarl Keirstead: Yeah.\nKelly Steckelberg: Really about\u2026\nKarl Keirstead: Yeah.\nKelly Steckelberg: \u2026 the seasonality of the renewals. I can\u2019t stress that enough for everybody. Remember, it\u2019s the two factors. It\u2019s -- the fact that they bill in Q1 and then so you are going to see an uptick in billings and deferred and collections. And then that amortizes over time and then the billings in Q4 are just a lot smaller. So you have this double impact, right? Now you have amortized a lot of the deferred that was picked up in Q1, so We are down at the lowest period and the billings in Q4 are the lightest period to refill that bucket. So it\u2019s going to, look, this is going to be a phenomenon that We are going to see for years to come, as I talked about until. Over time, we start to see more and more of our bookings happening in but that\u2019s going to take a long time.\nKarl Keirstead: Yeah. Makes sense. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay. Thanks a lot, Karl. Thanks everybody.\nOperator: And again that does conclude our Q&A session for today. I will go ahead and turn things back over to Eric for any closing or additional remarks.\nEric Yuan: Thank you. First of all, thank you for every Zoom employees, great work. Thank you for every customer, partner and investors, greater support. You all have a wonderful holiday season. Thank you again. See you in our Q4 meeting. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Eric. And again, this does conclude today\u2019s earnings release. We thank you all so much for your participation. And from our family to yours, may you have a safe and happy holiday season. Enjoy the rest of your day and again we will see you next quarter. Good-bye.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. Let me now turn to the quarter's results and guidance. In Q3, total revenue came in at $1.102 billion, up 5% year-over-year and 7% in constant currency. This result was approximately $2 million above the high end of our quarterly guidance. The growth in revenue was primarily driven by strength in our Enterprise business, which grew 20% year-over-year and represented 56% of total revenue, up from 49% a year ago. We expect Enterprise customers to comprise an increasingly higher percentage of total revenue over time. From a product perspective, we had strong growth in Zoom Phone coupled with contributions from Zoom Rooms and other products. At Investor Day earlier this month, we introduced a new metric, Online Average Monthly Churn. In Q3, this metric continued to improve to 3.1% from 3.7% in Q3 of FY 2022 and 3.6% last quarter. We are pleased that this metric has now returned to pre-pandemic levels. The number of Enterprise customers grew 14% year-over-year to approximately 209,300. Our trailing twelve month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q3 came in at a healthy 117%. We saw 31% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 3,286 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 27% of revenue, up from 22% in Q3 of FY 2022. Our Americas revenue grew 11% year-over-year. EMEA continues to be impacted by the stronger dollar, the Russia-Ukraine war and Online performance, which combined led to a decline of 9% year-over-year. APAC, which was also impacted by the stronger dollar, declined 3% year-over-year. Now turning to profitability, I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities, and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 79.5%, an improvement from 76% in Q3 of last year and 78.9% last quarter. The sequential improvement was mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our increasing number of co-located data centers. Given this, we expect our full year gross margin to be approximately 79%. Research and development expense grew by 59% year-over-year to approximately $108 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 9.8% from 6.4% in Q3 of last year. This reflects our ongoing investments in expanding Zoom's product portfolio and delivering on our customer's evolving needs. We expect to exit the year in the range of 10% to 12% of total revenue, consistent with our long-term target. Sales and marketing expense grew by 27% year-over-year to $301 million. This represented approximately 27.3% of total revenue, up from 22.6% in Q3 of last year. We continue to invest judiciously in sales capacity and channel partner expansion. G&A expense grew by 6% to $87 million or approximately 7.9% of total revenue, in line with 7.8% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP operating income was $381 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $330 million, as we continue to thoughtfully prioritize investments. This translates to a 34.6% non-GAAP operating margin for Q3, as compared to 39.1% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.07, $0.24 above the high end of our guidance. Due to our share repurchase program, our Q3 weighted average share count has decreased year-over-year approximately 4 million shares to 302 million. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.4 billion, up 14% year-over-year from $1.2 billion. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $3.2 billion, up 32% year-over-year from $2.5 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 59% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 67% in Q3 of last year, reflecting a shift towards longer term contracts. As a reminder, our annual seasonality of renewals is front-end loaded and moderates over the rest of the year, reflecting the sequentially smaller renewal base. As such, we expect Q4 deferred revenue to grow at approximately 2% to 3% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. Year-to-date, we have purchased $991 million of our own stock, representing approximately 11 million shares. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $295 million, as compared to $395 million in Q3 of last year. Free cash flow was $273 million, as compared to $375 million in Q3 of last year. Our margins for operating cash flow and free cash flow were 26.8% and 24.7%, respectively. As previously discussed, this year we have seen larger cash outflows from an increase in cash taxes starting in Q2, which relate to the depletion of our NOLs and the lower tax deductions for stock-based compensation caused by the stock price decline. We now expect free cash flow to be at the high end of our range of $1 billion to $1.15 billion. As a reminder, our range assumes that the Section 174 tax legislation requiring capitalization of R&D expenses will be repealed or deferred by Congress by the end of this fiscal year. Now, turning to guidance. This outlook is consistent with what we are observing in the market today. Specifically, it assumes that our Enterprise business will grow in the low-to-mid 20s, while our Online business will decline approximately 8% for the year. For the fourth quarter of FY 2023, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.095 billion to $1.105 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 3% year-over-year growth or 5% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $316 million to $326 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.75 to $0.78 based on approximately 301 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY 2023, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.37 billion to $4.38 billion, which at the midpoint represents approximately 7% year-over-year growth or 8.5% in constant currency. This represents a decrease of $15 million from our previous full year guidance, of which approximately $14 million is attributable to the continued FX pressure in Q3 and Q4. We now expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.49 billion to $1.5 billion, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 34%, which is an increase of $50 million or 1%, respectively, as compared to our Q2 guidance. Our tax rate is expected to approximate the blended U.S. federal and state rate. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $3.91 to $3.94, based on approximately 304 million shares outstanding. Zoom remains focused on thoughtfully balancing growth and profitability through platform innovation, customer value creation and partner ecosystem expansion. Thank you to the Zoom team, our customers, our community and our investors. Kelsey, please queue up our first question. Yeah. So we -- as we shared at Analyst Day a few weeks ago, we're really happy with the continued improvement in the churn, first of all, and it improved even further in Q3. And the fact that now 70% of those cohorts have moved beyond that 16-month period in which they really see stabilization and we continue to see that happen. Wendy and her team are really focused on continuing to look at initiatives for conversion. Those include things like adding local currencies, adding local payment types, as well as looking at packages that make sense. So all of that is still in process, and what we're thinking and we had talked about before is we expect Online to stabilize from a dollar perspective in Q2 of next year and based on our most recent forecast, that is still the case. Yeah. So we continue to see strength in Zoom Phone. As a reminder, we announced on the last call that we had crossed over the 4 million seat mark. We also added nine customers in Q3 that have purchased over 10,000 seats and that brings us to a total of 64 customers in that category. So I think it shows continued strength, especially in the up market even in these challenging economic times. So we're excited about the prospects that we continue to see there and as we keep promising you all, we will break it out when it gets 10% of revenue. So you will be able to see that then a little more clearly. Yeah. So, as a reminder, this occurred, right, due to the significant increase of customers we had during Q1 in the early stages of the pandemic. And what has happened is due to the practice that we have internally of making it easy for our customers, we co-term when they add on additional products or expand their seat count, for example, so it's continued to actually exacerbate, if you will, when we're upselling customers that front-end loaded phenomenon. So it will start to level out over time as we see customers in Q2 and Q4 being our largest seasonal quarters due to the six-month quotas of our upmarket reps. But as you say, we are used to it now internally, everybody knows this is how it works. We are coming into, I guess, our third renewal period and we have seen strength in each of the last two cycles. So We are able to accommodate, we know how it works and it's just something we know that it's not aligned with most of the rest of the industry, which is why we keep reminding you and trying to give you as much color as possible around that. Yeah. Eric, do you want to talk about Zoom One first and then I will talk about the metrics after that. And Kash, just in terms of like your comment about renewals, I want to highlight, especially in the Enterprise renewals remain very, very strong. We were actually slightly ahead of our internal forecast for Q3. So we continue to see -- we have talked about many metrics, growth and expansion in The enterprise. It's just, as you say, we are waiting for that stabilization in Online to because right now, it's really having a dampening effect on the overall growth rate of the company. Yeah. So we certainly have seen impact, as I mentioned, from FX of the reduced guidance of $15 million, $14 million of that is coming from FX pressure and you saw that certainly in our year-over-year growth in Europe and in APAC. In the Enterprise, again, renewals stayed strong, excitement about the products. But as we discussed, it's continued in terms of additional deal scrutiny, I think all of my peer CFOs now are looking at deals and that's just causing elongation in general not that things are losing, not that We are losing deals. They are just taking longer to get done and potentially some of them pushing over quarters. But we haven't seen that have impact. It's just taking longer and longer, not that they are going anywhere else. It's just taking longer to get those done. Now the good news is, right, especially with all of the new products, the consolidation that we offer is a really great value story for our customers in terms of elimination of additional vendors, getting rid of on-prem servers and that continues to be a great story that our customers love. Thank you, Siti. Yeah. So we certainly -- we have talked about this the last couple of quarters, have seen more and more of our deals shifting to the end of the quarter and taking on that more historically natural cycle that we didn't -- we haven't seen since really early in the pandemic, but that is absolutely the case for us and we have adjusted our forecast for Q4 for some of that linearity as well. We have continued to see, as I keep saying, strength in our renewals, and I think, that's because while there's concern about layoffs, there's this other phenomenon about flexible work, right? Everybody wants to continue to working in the way they become accustomed to. And as long as employers are supporting that and their employees it really means everybody needs a Zoom license. If you are out of the office, even 1 day a week, you need that Zoom license for phone, for Meetings, for what Zoom One. And so I think that is really compelling reasons for organizations to continue to renew with them. So, first, we believe that the Supplemental Grant program is really important for the strategy of the company in terms of retaining our employees and keeping them focused and not having to worry about that. And the Supplemental Grants vest over the same period as the underlying grant that they are tied to. So you are going to see this level continue for a few years as those grants are vesting through and many of them originally were four-year grants, so they have two years or three years left in which you are going to see that stock-based comp as those underlying shares are vesting. With the stock, once the stock stabilizes then you will see less impact from that or less need for additional grants. So we are hoping that we are at that place and that you are going to not see additional Supplemental Grant in that same level. But until we get past probably another year's worth, we might have some more. In terms of the repurchase, as you heard, we purchased $991 million, so or 11 million shares. So we have a little bit of room with that and once we have completed that, we will evaluate whether or not we want to ask the Board for authorization. We haven't done that yet. Yeah. So we have talked about this before, our Online business is a higher margin business as it's largely, not completely, but largely untouched by any person from a sales organization. There are some Online account executives that are there to answer questions. But it's minimal compared to our Enterprise sales organization. So we certainly took -- we have done a lot of work on modeling what that looks like a and we have taken that into consideration as we laid out our long-term margins that we shared with you at Analyst Day as we look forward for the next several years and how we think the mix could shift between the underlying the Online, sorry, Online and Enterprise businesses. Yeah. Hi, Ryan. Yeah. Hi. So, yeah, the answer is yes. There are customers that eventually upsell into Enterprise, which is great, right, because that means they are expanding and they are becoming a bigger customer overall, which we love to see, but that does then, I mean, it's not company churn, but it looks like it's moving out of the Online business into the Enterprise. And in terms of -- the way We are talking about it is a stabilization of Online and we expect that from a dollar perspective to still happen in Q2 of next year, based on our current forecast that We are seeing. So, Eric, I know you love to talk about Zoom One. Do you want to talk about it for a second just... Thank you, Eric. I would just add to that, that the key customer wins that we saw in Zoom One in Q3 were a pretty balanced mix of new, as well as customers that are upselling as they are adding new products to the portfolio, so We are really happy about that, that We are seeing traction in both aspects of the business. Yeah. So the current RPO pressure is largely related to the Online customers and the decline that you are seeing in Online as the long-term RPO really benefits from the direct and -- or the Enterprise side of our business, which are managed by the direct business and have more annual and multiyear contracts. That's kind of why you see that shift in terms of the overall percentage. I would say and then the other impact that We are having that we can't -- which is difficult to predict, of course, is FX, right? So you have to consider that, which is more concentrated Online than an Enterprise, but you heard we in our guidance that we have reduced, we said about $14 million of that, we believe to be attributable to FX. In general, I would say, the economics or the state of our business hasn't changed. Meaning, our Enterprise business and our Enterprise sales organization is stable. They are continuing to operate in the same way. The Online business with the improvement in churn, as well as the way that the majority of it now has shifted out along beyond the 15 months is really helpful in terms of our ability to forecast that business. And so I think the visibility is the same, there's just some different reasons for all those different components that you are talking about. The deferred is -- again, the decline you are seeing in Q4 is really due to the front-end loaded nature of our business. And then remember, so the front-end billing, sorry, the renewals happen at the front-end of the year, that's where you are going to see the upswing in billings, the upswing in deferred and then that gets amortized over the years, so deferred's coming down and then we have much lower renewals in Q4 as well. So the renewals that are filling up the bucket are much, much smaller. So it's -- you mentioned many factors and there's different reasons for all of those. Yeah. Yeah. So, first of all, remember, our strategy for selling Zoom Phone is selling into existing -- in the existing installed base. So I don't know actually a split between those 9, but I am sure that the majority of those were existing Zoom customers. And I think I would say, there's a focus on the company that, as Eric has talked about of expanding not beyond, not to just phone, right, but expanding to the full platform. So that's really what we have our teams focusing on now. It's Zoom One, it's Contact Center, it's Zoom IQ for Sales. Now it's Email and Calendar and really thinking about that complete platform, including Zoom Chat and the adoption within organization. So it -- for all the reasons we have been talking about in terms of retention, flexibility for organizations to reduce vendors, the cost savings, the total cost of ownership that they see by having that combined that for all of those reasons, that's really becoming the focus of our Enterprise sales organization. So, Eric, do you want to talk about the platform and the value they see. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. So we continue every day to look at opportunities, and yes, the compression evaluation certainly is not lost on us. What We are always trying to balance, of course, is what would it bring to our customers, what would it bring or the impact potentially on our culture and then, of course, the value and the state of the technology, right? We have a high bar for both talent and technology here at Zoom. So it's been difficult, I would say, to date to find something that really meets all of those standards. Eric is a very hard judge, but that doesn't mean that We are stopping and we continue to look for opportunities every. Yeah. So I think that your assessment in terms -- We are not giving -- we just may be caveat first of all, We are not giving FY 2024 guidance on this call. We will do that obviously at the Q4 call. But your assessment in the way you are kind of thinking about the topline growth is right in line with kind of how We are thinking about it right now. And in terms of then from an operating margin perspective, the way We are thinking about it is, as We are working on our FY 2024 plan, we are being very, very thoughtful about prioritization of investments. It's how I would say it. And as you noted, we have grown our expenses and we have hired a lot this year, and so being very thoughtful about ensuring that they are focused on the right things that we are prioritized internally. We are committed to continuing on innovation and meeting our customer's needs, as well as go-to-market expansion. Those are really the top priorities that we have and making sure that we have resources in the right areas for that. I guess that's what I would say. Yeah. So we think based on the share repurchase program that we have had -- we currently have in place, we have done a good job of being able to offset the dilution from the supplemental shares. We want to be very thoughtful about our cash those. We just talked about M&A for example. And so especially as We are focusing on our FY 2024 plan, our balancing the opportunity for managing dilution, as well as earnings on that cash and M&A opportunities. So all of those are being considered as we look forward for FY 2024 and that's really what we have to say today. We will have more to talk about when we come back for the Q4 call. Yeah. Yeah. So really happy with the progress we have seen with Zoom One, with Zoom Phones and the strength in Zoom Rooms in Q3. We also certainly see potential in Contact Center and Ryan Koontz, they are just so early. That from a -- We are seeing progress there and excitement, but it's early stages. So in terms of what they are contributing overall to the dollar amount, it's minimal at this point, but we are seeing growth in terms of quarter-over-quarter expansion in those products. So that's really exciting to see. So, yeah, Todd, Catherine is referring to Todd, who joined us, I think, a couple of quarters ago, he's great. At Zoomtopia, he hosted our first partner connect with over 400 partners were there. So that was super exciting to see. And while there are lots of opportunities, I think, one of the biggest areas of opportunity is international partner expansion. We have done a good job over the last few years of building up master agents and carriers here in the U.S., but it's still relatively nascent outside the U.S. So that will be a big area of focus for sure. Yeah. Yeah. So in terms of our reps, we are constantly looking at opportunities to help make them more productive. And as you -- we were just talking about we have hired a lot over the last few years and as we look forward to FY 2024, we will be making many fewer hires. So We are really looking for how do we enable the reps, how do we make sure that we have the overlay teams in the right places to support them. As a reminder, that's -- we have specialists that are selling Contact Center and Phone and that's a really important aspect of making sure that everybody is aligned on serving our customers in the best way possible. So that is a big focus. We also have a new President, Greg Tomb, that you all met last quarter and he's been spending a lot of time helping us think about that, especially as We are moving up in the Enterprise stack, that's his experience, so where his background is. And then -- and really focusing on making sure that our comp plans aligned. That's another thing that We are taking a look at for FY 2024 as well. Thanks, James. Yeah. I think it's very similar to Zoom Meeting licenses in the aspect of as long as you have a hybrid workforce, you need the right technology in your conference room. Other -- to ensure that you have this inclusive experience that we have all become so accustomed to and we continue to listen to our customers, customers work on innovations to ensure that we provide that. But I don't think it's going to go away. I mean we will see what happens, right? I think it's still yet to come to see what happens with like commercial real estate. However, Zoom Rooms and the importance of those in a hybrid workforce, I just -- I can't tell you how important that is. I can't stress enough the importance of that and that's really what our customers are seeing as well as they are in some sort of state of a hybrid work environment. Yeah. So in the Online segment of the business for Q4, we expect churn to be pretty much in line with Q3. I mean it's likely that number is going to bounce around a little bit quarter-to-quarter and that's going to all be visible to you now as we report it, but we are not forecasting any dramatic changes there. And then in the Online segment, I would say that, the -- I mean, sorry, in the Enterprise segment, I would say, the biggest change that We are seeing is just this continued push to deals being at the back end of the quarter. And so that linearity -- over the last few years, we had a much more balanced linearity in our Enterprise segment and what that leads to, of course, is deals contributing to revenue in the quarter and We are seeing much less of that as these deals are going back to the more traditional back end, really, really back end of the quarter. Now we have the benefit in of having kind of the two periods of December 31st close and then the January 31st close, but we are expecting the linearity more consistent like with what we have seen in Q3 than what we saw a year ago. Yeah. Hi, Karl. Thank you, Karl. I should have said this earlier. So as a reminder, we don't guide to billings we never have, because we don't think that they are a good indicator for us. Because of the large percentage of our customers that are, especially in the Online segment of the business that are on monthly contracts. And so because they bill and they pay us monthly, they don't show up in that number and so that's why it doesn't -- it isn't really a good proxy for you to use. Nothing significant. It's really more about the timing -- you are talking about the deferred revenue specifically... Really about... ... the seasonality of the renewals. I can't stress that enough for everybody. Remember, it's the two factors. It's -- the fact that they bill in Q1 and then so you are going to see an uptick in billings and deferred and collections. And then that amortizes over time and then the billings in Q4 are just a lot smaller. So you have this double impact, right? Now you have amortized a lot of the deferred that was picked up in Q1, so We are down at the lowest period and the billings in Q4 are the lightest period to refill that bucket. So it's going to, look, this is going to be a phenomenon that We are going to see for years to come, as I talked about until. Over time, we start to see more and more of our bookings happening in but that's going to take a long time. Okay. Thanks a lot, Karl. Thanks everybody."

            "name": "Eric Yuan",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and thank you everyone for joining us today. So last week, we hosted our first fully hybrid Zoomtopia using Zoom Events and it was great. We unveiled new innovations like Zoom Mail and Calendar, which enable users to frictionlessly navigate across their email, calendar and other Zoom products all within the same client. At Zoomtopia, many of our customers highlighted how they use our expanding platform to do more in the world of flexible work. At our first partner connect event, we hosted hundreds of channel partners, who are very excited about working with us to drive adoption of the Zoom platform globally. And our developer partners showcased add-on apps that connect interrelated workflows to the Zoom client. As global organizations adapt to how, when and where work happens, human connection remains paramount. Zoom is purpose-built to make all kinds of connections possible, effective and meaningful. We have developed and launched more than 1,500 features and enhancements on the Zoom platform this year, advancing how people connect with each other, their organization and their customers, ultimately, opening the doors wide for creativity and collaboration. Of course, even as we celebrate our innovations and customers, we still face the backdrop of a challenging macroeconomic environment. We continue to see FX pressure and heightened deal scrutiny for new business, but remain focused on delivering happiness to our customers by innovating our platform and expanding our go-to-market capabilities. Zoom provides a full suite of communications solutions at an attractive total cost of ownership that enables Teams to do more with less and our new products like Zoom Contact Center and Zoom IQ for Sales enable revenue generation and drive productivity. The continued strength of our Enterprise growth is a testament to how the value proposition of our platform resonates with customers even in tougher economic environments. As we enable customers to drive greater efficiency, we also are focusing on our own efficiency. We have always been judicious with investments, prudent about spending and we have commanded robust margins since our IPO, so this is not a major shift for us. We will continue to drive innovation, customer value and platform expansion, balanced with an increasing emphasis on efficiency and profitability. We continued to see strong traction with customers spending greater than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue, which was up 31% year-over-year. What's more, these customers are increasingly seeing value in buying the whole platform, with thousands of customers already buying Zoom One packages. From an industry perspective, the largest deals came from tech, media and financial services, and we also had notable wins in retail, transportation and pharma. On the tech front, let me first thank Qualtrics, the leader and creator of the Experience Management category, for expanding their partnership with us. Qualtrics recently upgraded to Zoom One Enterprise, which provides the full power of the Zoom platform to their users and allows them to make meaningful connections with Meetings, team chat, whiteboard, phone and more in one offering. We are delighted to offer Qualtrics a broad set of communications products integrated into one secure and easy-to-use platform. Our Enterprise segment comprises not only large publicly-traded companies, but also many private companies of all sizes, who see great value in enhancing their Zoom implementations by moving towards our full UC platform. Let me give you a few examples. First of all, I'd like to thank Vensure Employer Services, a privately-owned professional employer organization for placing their trust in Zoom. In Q3, they added 5,500 Zoom Phone seats and 650 Zoom Contact Center seats demonstrating the promise they saw in adopting a modern, integrated solution for their teams to interact. Let me also thank Chime Solutions for establishing and already expanding their partnership with Zoom, which includes Zoom One and Zoom Contact Center. Founded with an unwavering focus on bringing jobs and opportunities to underrepresented communities, Chime Solutions delivers high-touch Contact Center solutions for mid-sized companies and Fortune 500 corporations. After seeing how well Zoom Contact Center addressed many of their customer's needs and gaining confidence in Zoom's ability to deliver innovation at a rapid pace, they decided to replace their legacy solution with Zoom Contact Center. Executing our innovation roadmap for Contact Center will give us the opportunity to further enhance our partnership with Chime Solutions in the quarters and years to come. I also want to thank G-P, the number one SaaS-based global employment platform, for choosing Zoom Phone to transform their communication systems and support employees across their organization. G-P understood the value of our integrated platform of communication products from their experience using Zoom Meetings, Zoom Webinars, Team Chat and Zoom Rooms. G-P ultimately opted for Zoom Phone, as the missing piece in their UC stack, in order to improve their customer's experience, while also enjoying the savings benefits of a cloud-based PBX solution integrated into a full communications platform. Also, I'd like to add that G-P is Zoom's global expansion employment partner and has played a critical role in our growth strategy, giving us the agility and speed to enter new markets very quickly. Again, thank you Qualtrics, Vensure, Chime Solutions and G-P, and all of our customers worldwide. And with that, I will pass it over to Kelly. Thank you. Yeah. So, Mark, that's a great question. That's the reason why we had a very successful Zoomtopia, because we announced so many innovations, almost every innovation. When we look at that what we can do to either add value to the existing paid customer to focus on stickiness or maybe the potential revenue opportunity, right? Look at area features, I think, we always follow that principle. Look at Email and calendar, look at Online paid users, the subscribers and we do not offer to free users, right? For all those Online, the pro buyers give Email, Calendar for free, they can use the Email, Calendar full [Indiscernible] another great service, which is an [Indiscernible], right? Look at all other features, like, Spots and all those features certainly can help our integrated customers also make our services more sticky. Not only do they use Zoom for schedule Meetings, but also can use that to mimic the office environment. So for free users, right, [Indiscernible] Email, Calendar, [Indiscernible] Spots client, right? So every feature [Indiscernible], I think, for sure, will add more value to our customers, either drive stickiness or drive potential revenue opportunity like Zoom IQ, virtual agent and the Contact Center and virtual agent, Zoom IQ like virtual coach and a lot of features like that. So we are very, very excited, and again, and the feedback from customers are very, very positive and they are very excited about adopting those new features and enhancements. Thank you, Mark. Yeah. Fred, to add on to what Kelly said, more and more customers are increasingly looking at our Zoom platform, Zoom One UC platform, usually look at a [Indiscernible] product, phone or Meetings or webinar or team chat. Now look at a full UC stack, because that will give you a better experience in terms of the total ownership of cost is also much better. That's why more and more customers are moving towards our full, like, Zoom One platform and I am very excited about the opportunities there. Thank you. Yeah. Sure. Absolutely. So, Kash, that is a good question. And you look at the customer projects, right, as we move towards the Zoom One platform, right? So and leverage our full usage stack started from Meetings many years ago. They added a phone, webinar, team chat and so on and so forth. I think the problem was that previously when it comes to Zoom, everybody probably assume that is to be compressing and that's not the case. That's why we are doubling down our Zoom One marketing awareness, also talk to the customers that we understand, not only do we offer the best with content service, but also if you look at our other offerings that's a full UC stack and also have Contact Center as well. I think that will take a little bit of time. But as long as customers really like, wow, Zoom has a full stack, Enterprise also have a very flexible team chat plus this is free. It works so well, integrated other UC solutions, I think customers are showing a great excitement about adopting the full UC platform. And more and more customers are moving towards our full UC stack rather than just the Meeting or Phone and that's why we are very excited. Because if you look at all those offerings working together seamlessly and in terms of total orders costs much better, because many interest customers are trying to consolidate their full UC that. UC stack and client stack is different, but we might use a Email or Calendar or SharePoint or the Office from other vendors. But in terms of UC stack, they want to deploy the best, good service. That's why we are going to win on UC stack plus download the CC as well. Thank you. Thank you, Kash. Yeah. So, yeah, again, the Contact Center is a new service, We are very excited in particular for those customers who deploy our -- full service who would like to consolidate the UC and CC together. And also, we found interesting use cases, well, not only do those traditional customer interaction department, we started deploying the Zoom Contact Center, but also the internal IT desk as well, right? And again, the Contact Center seat cycle a little bit longer like the Meetings. But, however, we showcase our platform capability and the speed of innovation, customers are very excited. And plus, you look at our own business, right? And we used to deploying other cloud Contact Center solutions, also with [inaudible] our own Contact Center solutions, our teams themselves are very, very excited. And a lot of potential pipelines and leads right in the pipeline and also we are doubling that on that. And again, the product side, we have higher confidence. Go-to-market side, we are gaining attractions as quickly as possible, because again, it takes some time plus also leverage channel and internal go-to-market investment. And I think that's a future big revenue driver for us, especially customer like CC and UC together, right, and with a much better experience and also the total ownership of costs also much better. Thank you. Yeah. Thank you, Sterling. If I could... Even for those businesses, right, after before the full UC stack, look at the team chat is getting more and more popular. And also the founder also can use that for their personal use cases as well, right, because that's free. That's why a lot of tractions for other parts of our entire UC platform. Yeah. Michael. Yes. Sure. Exactly. I think that -- first of all, I think, Parker, you look at our Zoom One, we launched several months ago, right? And look at all those customers, minimum-sized, Enterprise, SMB, they also see the value, that's why we see and almost every market we are talking, they are moved towards the Zoom One package, so they do see the value. But you not see any test markets that the segment truly standing out from all the way from SMB to device and I think that's exactly what we anticipated. Thank you. Yeah. Sure. Absolutely. I think for those customers, right, who deploy Zoom One platform, right? They really like it. The reason why you look at the when same client, the same interface, right? And if you have a scaled meeting, you can use our Zoom team chat, communicate with our teammates and customers, make a phone call, white board is there, now we added Email and Calendar fully integrated together. I think that's the whole lot. And plus, if you look at the customer, we used to be deploying many other partners solutions, always one platform on the full UC stack. That is value a seamless experience and that's why more and more customers no matter which other cloud business solutions they deploy, for example, we deploy other cloud business solutions not realize the full value of the entire Zoom One platform, we see more and more end customers, they just reach out to us rather than they reach out to Zoom to update. Now they reach out to us. We say, yeah, I see the good value and that's why more and more innovations will be built upon the Zoom One platform. And yeah, like, Zoom Spot, We arecently announced and that's our focus to double down our platform story. Also, in terms of the full platform experience that I mentioned, our customer, the number one thing they like in our experience. Let's say, if you look at the other biggest service provider, right? How to make sure you have a consistent experience, that's not an easy. That's why we tend to look at all those greater technology companies like Solvvy, we acquired many years ago. Again, if you want to just the focus on the branded new service, we might think about the inorganic opportunity. But now look at the UC platform, we already did everything. Now We are just focus on the go-to-market side, right? And we are -- we have a high confidence like We are getting more and more traction there, so. Thank you. Yeah. So, Alex, I think, We are a much better position. You look at the efficiency and the potential productivity improvements like cash flow profitability and plus we had, as Kelly mentioned, we had a lot of teams this year. I think that they are going to reach full productivity next year. That's why I think, yeah, I think we can weather the storm, right? And for any either short-term or long-term or short or long recession, and yeah, we feel very confident to drive efficiency and productivity. And James, another big point just to add on to what Kelly said and also the Zoom IQ for Sales that product certainly added value to drive our team's productivity, right, especially when reps that work remotely, right, how to manage their productivity, drive efficiency, take some actions, right, quickly. I think we will deploy Zoom IQ for Sales by end of this month, literally every rep will be fully trained on Zoom IQ for Sales, right? Not only do we have our sales productivity and also we will create a lot of opportunity for us to sell more and more Zoom IQ for Sales. That's a future value for areas to drive productivity. Thank you. And also, Matt, another thing just quickly, so it used to be like you look at the conference room, right, most of the usage are used internal, right, for internal cost. Now look at the Zoom Rooms, that's not the case. A lot of customers are leveraging Zoom, right, talk to the customers and the partners, right? That's one difference, because that's the reason why customer like Zoom, right? When you talk with the customer partners, you want to make sure I have the best experience, right? And another thing even for those companies who might think about laying off employees and reduce number of the employees. Guess what? Less taxes, but more conference rooms. Then otherwise, what can you do, right, to double down our customer and partner, right? And that's why we still see the great opportunity ahead of us. Thank you. First of all, thank you for every Zoom employees, great work. Thank you for every customer, partner and investors, greater support. You all have a wonderful holiday season. Thank you again. See you in our Q4 meeting. Thank you."

And now, I will hand things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations. Tom, over to you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Kelcey and hello everyone. Welcome to Zoom\u2019s earnings webinar for the second quarter of fiscal \u201823. I am joined today by Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan; Zoom\u2019s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg; and we are also pleased to have our new President, Greg Tomb, join us for today\u2019s call. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and maybe downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.com. Also on this page, you will be able to find a copy of today\u2019s prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2023. Our expectations regarding financial and business trends, impacts from macroeconomic developments the Russia-Ukraine war, our market position, opportunities, growth strategy and business aspirations, and product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including our annual report on Form 10-K and our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements we may make on today\u2019s webinar. And with that, let me turn things over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Tom and thank you everyone for joining us today. I am on the road now and my Internet access is limited. I will hand my remarks to Kelly and Greg and join you all for the Q&A portion. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric and thank you everyone for joining us today. Let me start with what\u2019s on everyone\u2019s mind, the macro environments. Zoom is not immune to the global downturn, but the situation is more complex than meets the eye. Our enterprise business continued to post strong growth, which we believe is because cloud migration and digital transformation continue to be a priority even when and perhaps especially when the economy slows. The headwinds we saw mainly relate to the strengthening dollar, new online subscriptions and to a lesser extent, bookings linearity. We have implemented initiatives focused on driving new online subscriptions, which have shown early promise but were not enough to overcome the macro dynamics in the quarter. We believe Zoom remains well positioned in this environment as customers look to increase productivity and collaboration while moving away from expensive legacy vendors. Our products are designed to drive efficiency and cost savings within organizations and are loved by both their employees and their customers. In addition, we have strong margins and cash flows as well as a large cash balance. Even still, we are taking a prudent and cautious approach in this environment with focused investments and hiring to drive innovation and customer happiness. Our platform strategy is playing out very well and Zoom Rooms and Zoom Phone are critical components of that strategy. In fact, Zoom Phone was a real star in Q2, hitting several milestones. The number of customers with 10,000 or more paid seats increased 112% year-over-year. In addition, we broke our record for the largest Zoom Phone deal twice in the quarter, first with a global retailer and then with a global bank, both with more than 125,000 seats. Deals like these led Zoom Phone to post a record quarter and surpassed 4 million seats in August. We are also seeing early traction for Zoom Contact Center and Zoom IQ for sales. Zoom Contact Center is only 6 months old, but has already had deal sizes reach seats that we did not expect until its second year. And customers value the user-friendly interface, efficiency gains and savings they see in shifting to our modern cloud-based AI-driven contact center solutions. We are proud of the team that drove these results and I am thrilled to have Greg with us today. Greg joined last quarter as our new President leading our go-to-market teams and the office of the Global CIO. He brings a wealth of leadership experience scaling bellwether Internet and enterprise companies. Greg, welcome to our call today.\nGreg Tomb: Well, thank you, Kelly and I am very happy to join today.\nKelly Steckelberg: We would love to have you introduce some customer wins for the quarter.\nGreg Tomb: Absolutely, Kelly. Well, hello, everyone. Very nice to meet all of you. I wish it was in person. We actually did have an exceptional sales quarter in the enterprise market and I\u2019ll let Kelly give you more details in a minute. We had a number of great new wins, including one of the largest U.S. healthcare providers out there. I can\u2019t give you their name yet, we will in the future, but they did choose Zoom Meetings and Zoom Phone to provide telehealth services to the broad number of caregivers and patients. I mean, they were just really impressed with Zoom\u2019s strong integration between video and voice to support 40,000 plus employees and their external community for a wide variety of telehealth needs. I also want to thank UCLA. And you may know this or may not, but they were recognized by U.S. News & World Report as the number one public university in the U.S. And I want to thank them, because they expanded their relationship with Zoom by adding 15,000 Zoom Phone licenses and this large investment will accelerate their journey to the cloud and will offer them the benefits of truly having a unified communications platform. The next company I want to thank is Warner Bros. Discovery, a premier global media entertainment company. I want to thank them for partnering with Zoom on its global communications needs. Our partnership actually began before the merger with Discovery and really kicked into gear once these two iconic brands merged. And they have chosen to expand their meetings and phone deployment and we are really excited to deliver for them a full integrated suite of communication services. Next, I\u2019d like to thank Ancestry and you probably know Ancestry as the global leader when it comes to family history. I want to thank them for also expanding their relationship with Zoom. The strong customer relationship that we built during the original Zoom Meetings deployment and they also had a successful partnership with Solvvy, it allowed us to expand this to a complete platform. We included Zoom Phone. We have a scalable now conversational AI-based chat system in place and self-service capabilities from Solvvy. And last let me also thank Optiv, the cyber advisory and solutions leader. Today, they deliver strategic and technical expertise to nearly 6,000 companies across every major industry. Optiv started as a Zoom Meetings customer back in 2016, then they expanded to Zoom Phone last year, and they really appreciated how reliable and simple our integrated solutions work. And then this last quarter in Q2, they decided to replace their legacy contact center with Zoom Contact Center and it\u2019s more than 275 agents supporting roughly 90 workflows. And they were so impressed with our rapid product iteration, our roadmap for integrations with other SaaS tools as well as the ability to greatly reduce costs. So, again, I mean thank you, UCLA; thank you, Warner Bros; thank you Ancestry; thank you, Optiv and to all those customers that did business with us in Q2. We greatly appreciate it. And with that, Kelly, I\u2019ll pass it back to you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Greg. Now let me turn to the quarter\u2019s results and guidance. In Q2, total revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $1.099 billion, approximately $16 million below the low-end of our quarterly guidance. A stronger U.S. dollar, which had an impact of approximately $8 million, weaker new online sales, and to a lesser extent, back-end linearity in the quarter, were the biggest factors contributing to the miss. We recognize that the revenue results are disappointing and below our expectations as we navigate the current environment. It should be noted that while our online business saw lower new subscriptions, renewals and online continued to improve. And as we just discussed, we have launched a number of initiatives to drive new online subscriptions around local pricing, packaging and free-to-paid conversion. The growth in revenue was primarily driven by strength in our enterprise business. Revenue from enterprise customers grew 27% year-over-year and represented 54% of total revenue, up from 46% a year ago. We expect revenue from enterprise customers to become an increasingly higher percentage of total revenue over time. From a product perspective, we had strong growth in Zoom Meetings and Zoom Phone, coupled with contributions from Zoom Rooms and other products. The number of enterprise customers grew 18% year-over-year to approximately 204,100. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for enterprise customers in Q2 came in at a healthy 120%. We saw 37% year-over-year growth in the upmarket as we ended the quarter with 3,116 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represented 26% of revenue, up from 20% in Q2 of FY \u201822. As the majority of our revenue has shifted back to the enterprise and we have moved beyond the pandemic buying patterns, we are returning to more normalized enterprise sales cycles with linearity weighted towards the back end of the quarter. This contributed to higher than expected deferred revenue in Q2. And as we believe this customer behavior will persist, we have factored it into our outlook. Our Americas and APAC revenue grew 12% and 10% year-over-year respectively. EMEA continues to be impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war, the strengthening dollar and online performance, which led to an 8% year-over-year revenue decline. Now turning to profitability. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities and all tax effects resulting from non-GAAP adjustments. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 78.9%, an improvement from 76.2% in Q2 of last year and 78.6% last quarter. The sequential improvement was mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our increasing number of co-located data centers. Given the improvements we are seeing so far this year, we expect gross margins to be approximately 78% for the remainder of the year, which is higher than our previous view. Research and development expense grew by 81% year-over-year to approximately $98 million, driven by our focus on innovation. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 8.9% from 5.3% in Q2 of last year. Our expanding product portfolio reflects our ongoing investments in building out Zoom\u2019s platform and delivering on our customers\u2019 evolving needs. We plan to further invest in R&D to reach our long-term target of 10% to 12% of total revenue. Sales and marketing expense grew by 35% year-over-year to $286 million. This represented approximately 26% of total revenue, up from 20.7% in Q2 of last year. We are committed to investing in growth areas, including sales capacity, channel partner enablement and product marketing. G&A expense grew by 2% to $90 million or approximately 8.2% of total revenue. Non-GAAP operating income expanded to $394 million, exceeding the high-end of our guidance of $365 million as we continue to thoughtfully prioritize investments. This translates to a 35.8% non-GAAP operating margin for Q2 compared with 41.6% a year ago and 37.2% last quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.05 on approximately 307 million weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.13 above the high-end of our guidance. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year from $1.2 billion. This result was meaningfully higher than what we previously forecasted due to the strong enterprise bookings, which are back-end weighted in the quarter. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $3.2 billion, up 37% year-over-year from $2.3 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 61% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 69% in Q2 of last year, reflecting a shift towards longer term plans. As a reminder, our seasonality of renewals is front-end loaded and moderates over the rest of the year, reflecting the sequentially smaller renewal base. As such, we expect Q3 deferred revenue to grow at approximately 13% to 14% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We have purchased $426 million of stock, representing 4.1 million shares over the last two quarters as part of our $1 billion repurchase program. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $257 million as compared to $468 million in Q2 of last year. Adjusted free cash flow was $222 million as compared to $455 million in Q2 of last year. Our margins for operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow were 23.4% and 20.2% respectively. As previously discussed, these metrics include a large cash outflow from an increase in cash taxes starting in Q2. As we update our full year outlook for the P&L and take into account the lower tax deductions for stock-based compensation caused by the lower stock price, we would expect adjusted free cash flow to be between $1 billion to $1.15 billion. Now turning to guidance. This outlook is consistent with what we are observing in the market today. Specifically, it assumes that our enterprise business will grow in the low to mid-20s, while our online business will decline 7% to 8% for the year as compared to the previously provided flat outlook. For the third quarter of FY \u201823, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.095 billion to $1.1 billion. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $325 million to $330 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.82 to $0.83 based on approximately 306 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY \u201823, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.385 billion to $4.395 billion, which would represent approximately 7% year-over-year growth. At the midpoint, this represents a decrease of approximately $150 million as compared to our previous full year guidance. Of this decrease, approximately $35 million is due to the stronger dollar and $115 million is attributable to the broader macroeconomic environment. We now expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $1.44 billion to $1.45 billion. We are still targeting a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 33% as we have adjusted spending in the second half to focus on high ROI areas and have seen a modest benefit to expenses from FX. Our tax rate is expected to approximate the blended U.S. federal and state rate. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $3.66 to $3.69 based on approximately 307 million shares outstanding. Before opening up for Q&A, we are excited to share our Zoomtopia event with you. It is our premier user conference and will be run on Zoom Events. We look forward to sharing our platform strategy, new innovations and customer testimonials. Please join us at Zoomtopia and our Investor Day on November 8. Zoom remains focused on building out our platform, leading in the hybrid work world, enhancing the customer experience and expanding into more and more business workflows. We will continue to make strategic moves to drive future growth as we navigate the current environment. Thank you to the Zoom team, which has grown to 8,000 strong, our customers, our community and our investors. Kelcey, please queue up our first question.\nOperator: I will do. Thank you so much, Kelly. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is going to come from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash, would you mind turning on your camera, please? Kash, would you like to ask a question today? You can go ahead and unmute yourself as well. Alright. Well, hearing nothing from Kash, we will go ahead and we will move on. William, I am sorry, I am putting you on the spot here. I didn\u2019t let you know that you are next, but William Power with Baird, if you will go ahead and unmute and turn your camera on for us.\nWilliam Power: Great. Okay. Thanks for taking the question. Let me maybe start, Kelly. You noted, I think $115 million of macro impacts now in full year guidance. Maybe just help us unpack that a bit. How much of that relates to the online pressure versus any changes you are seeing on the enterprise side, whether it pertained to longer sales cycles? Any changes in seat counts \u2013 seat count pushback and any other commentary you can provide there?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. The majority of that is really coming from online, William. So when you look at the difference in the guidance and previously, we had expected online to be approximately flat for the year and now we are saying it\u2019s going to be in the range of 7% to 8% down, that\u2019s really where the majority of that is coming from on a base of about $2 billion. That\u2019s where we\u2019re seeing it. We continue to see strength in the enterprise, which you can see as the increase in deferred. We are moving more towards back-end linearity, which had some impact on the revenue, but we continue to see great work done by our enterprise team and getting those deals in just a little bit later in the quarter.\nWilliam Power: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Maybe if I can sneak one more in, just really strong Phone results, 225,000 customers. Maybe just any color on kind of sales cycles for a deal of that size. When do we expect the revenue to start to flow through? And just any commentary maybe just on the pipeline of larger deals, whether that size or bigger deals generally?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Greg, do you want to talk about that?\nGreg Tomb: Yes, I can comment \u2013 I mean, yes, I mean Q2 was a pretty amazing quarter around Zoom Phone, extremely high win rates. And I think we exceeded the \u2013 I think you mentioned, is Kelly, the $4 million user mark, right? So to do that in 3 years is just incredible. There is a \u2013 we see a large number of our enterprise customers today looking for looking for ways to consolidate and have a more modern communication experience and the fact that it\u2019s fully integrated with video makes it a natural place to go. So I think you\u2019re going to continue to see this really big uptick in our enterprise is taking advantage of both Video and Phone together. So \u2013 and our pipeline is showing that now.\nWilliam Power: Okay, thank you.\nGreg Tomb: Yes.\nOperator: Moving on to Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nEric Yuan: Hi, Meta.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Hi, thanks. Maybe, Kelly, just starting with some of the initiatives that you mentioned kind of taking on the SMB business and the actions that they are taking and just how that informs the 7% to 8% down during the year. What would they be without some of those initiatives? Just what\u2019s kind of informing that? And then maybe just if you could kind of speak to as you were making some of these OpEx decisions on what is kind of high priority or high ROI, just kind of what is going into that decision-making process? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So I think we touched on this. I\u2019m going to start with your second question first. We touched on this in the Q1 call as well. We will continue as a company to focus on the areas that drive innovation. So that really means R&D as well as driving growth. So that\u2019s sales ops. And we have taken the tack for a while now of trying to be as efficient as we can around cost of goods sold and, of course, G&A to the extent that, of course, we always want to ensure the product and the platform is reliable and we\u2019re supporting our customers\u2019 needs but trying to do that as efficiently as we can. And in fact, we indicated in the prepared remarks, we expect gross margins to come in a little bit higher than what we had previously at 7 8% for the rest of the year.  And then in terms of online, Wendy and her team have just done an amazing job of really thinking about how do we continue to improve the conversion rate of free-to-pay. They have done that through different initiatives, especially including pricing and packaging on a global basis. And we\u2019ve seen retention rates continue to improve as well as conversion rates. We just \u2013 the sort of the challenge that we\u2019re seeing overall in the online business is new customer additions. But as they continue to focus on the initiatives, I\u2019m sure that will improve our time as well.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: And Bernstein\u2019s Peter Weed will have the next question.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. I think in the past, you\u2019ve given us some guidance to help us understand on the net retention number in enterprise, where some of that\u2019s coming from, certainly, I think just a quick estimate suggests that you\u2019re seeing a continued tailing there. And in the past, I think you\u2019ve been seeing better support on the larger customers relative to some of the smaller customers. How should we be looking at that right now? Is that continuing to be the trend where your larger established customers are expanding their use across the platform? Are you seeing additional strength in the smaller customers are coming up? And by the way, as a second part to this question, I think the implication that I see out of the numbers that you posted is actually a bit of a reacceleration on new customers on the enterprise side, and I\u2019d love to hear a little bit about how you\u2019re seeing that. And I know that you saw \u2013 you said, hey, there is some linearity creating some challenges at the back end of the quarter, but to also kind of outperform on new customers there with some of those challenges is pretty nice, and I\u2019m just trying to understand how much momentum you see in that going forward in the face of some of these linearity issues. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Sure. So let me talk about the net dollar expansion, then I\u2019ll let Greg or Eric talk about new customers. But we have said for a while, when you remember that the strategy for selling Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms, contact center, etcetera, is to sell into our existing installed base. It\u2019s exactly as you said. We continue to see some of our largest customers continue to expand. Some of those Zoom Phone wins moved our customers. We \u2013 when you go back and look at the customer count of how many \u2013 the growth rates that we saw and greater than 100,000 trailing 12 months, like it\u2019s really significant growth, which supports exactly what you\u2019re saying. And as a reminder, the net dollar expansion number now is focused on just the Enterprise portion of our business. It doesn\u2019t include the online segment of the business. But Greg or Eric, would you either be like to just touch on new customers for the quarter?\nEric Yuan: Yes, sure, sure. Just quickly. So Peter, if you look at the Q2, right? Look at our enterprise wins doing very well. Just a very, very big and healthcare organization, they deploy Zoom not only for Phone but also for telemedicine as well. And we do see a lot of new opportunities like that just so \u2013 and it\u2019s doing extremely well on the enterprise front.\nGreg Tomb: Yes, I would add to what Eric and Kelly said is that I think we will continue to see that solid customer base in the enterprise expanding with us. I do think when you take a look at online, it is a little mixed because we\u2019ve got a lot of individual consumers that are down there that we\u2019re looking for ways to get them to move from free to paid. And what we\u2019re doing right now seems to be working, but we\u2019ve got to keep at it and continue to run additional actions. But I think we\u2019ve got a really great story that\u2019s coming together on the enterprise. And from a sales perspective, we\u2019re trying to focus more and more in the enterprise on how we\u2019re going to market, how we\u2019re marketing these companies and the value proposition, again, around the whole platform. We really have a great platform story today that allows companies to have more of an integrated end-to-end communication, a modern communication platform, and they can get rid of a lot of point solutions that are \u2013 they bought 20 years ago that are causing them a lot of pain and costing a lot of money. So I think we will see this trend continue.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. And by the way, on the net retention piece, you talked about FX. How much of the drag on net retention because you\u2019re not providing a constant currency basis of it was due to the FX effect versus just being truly slower growth?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. We\u2019re not going to break out FX down to that level of detail. But what I will say, if you step all the way back \u2013 and we talked about this in the Q1 call as well. If you look at the impact that FX and the war in Europe is having on the year-over-year growth, it\u2019s 200 basis points. So you can think about there is 2 full percentage points of impact coming from things that are kind of out of our control from both FX and the war on the total year-over-year growth rate.\nPeter Weed: Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we will move on to Matt Stotler with William Blair.\nMatt Stotler: Yes. Hi, everybody. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe I\u2019ll just ask one kind of doubling down on the macro question and conversation. I mean, Kelly, you noted that you look at updated guidance and back out the impact from the online business, back out the incremental FX impact versus prior guidance. It actually implies that you\u2019re expecting improvement in the enterprise segment of the business on a like-for-like basis. And so I would just be interested to kind of get some deeper color on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of buying behavior in that segment of the market, right? I mean, like you said, no one is immune from a slowdown in the macro. So you\u2019re seeing any sort of change on the enterprise side and customer behavior, spending patterns, anything like that, that you can point to?\nKelly Steckelberg: We definitely had a strong Q2 in terms of enterprise sales. That \u2013 you can see reflected in the deferred. It just came later in the quarter, which is why it didn\u2019t really have impact on revenue within the quarter. But we continue to \u2013 all the things we\u2019ve talked about, right? Zoom Phone having incredible strength and performance in the quarter, really already seeing momentum in contact center this early. 6 months in we have some remarkable names that have signed up for contact center that we will be excited to share with you at some point in the future. But already, the seat sizes that we\u2019re seeing for contact center, I think we would not have expected them to come from in their 18 to 24 months yet. So I think all of that shows that the platform transition is really working very, very well and that customers continue to love and see the efficiency they get from Zoom. And especially as they are thinking about \u2013 maybe, Greg, you can talk about this. Sort of what I heard from the sales team is these transition of deals moving from the CIO to the CFO and customers really being thoughtful about the cost there, and Zoom competes very well when it\u2019s competitively priced.\nGreg Tomb: Yes. I mean I would say it\u2019s I don\u2019t think it\u2019s surprising to anybody to think that any of these large transactions that are going through approval aren\u2019t getting that extra set of eyes from a finance perspective. But what\u2019s interesting is that we\u2019re in a world where hybrid work is not going away, right? It actually complicates things, but having a platform that supports that is really important even at the CEO level, right, because it helps them with attrition issues. It helps them hire the best people. It helps them have faster decisions, inclusive decisions. So having the right communication platform knows different than having the right decision around security or supply chain. These are just the top three or four that are sitting at the Board at the CEO level, and so they do get approved, right, I mean other than having a couple of sets of eyes and may be coming after us for a little bigger discount here or there, which delayed it a week or 2. I don\u2019t think we had anything major that slipped from quarter-to-quarter because people weren\u2019t going to spend the money. So I mean I was \u2013 I mean I\u2019ve been here now for 2 months, and I was really \u2013 I mean I was personally really amazed by how strong the execution was by our sales team and how the deals that were committed flow through the process.\nKelly Steckelberg: The other thing that I would just highlight is we also continue to see strength in movement from monthly to annual contracts in both our online as well as our enterprise business. And as you know, that really helps from a retention perspective and also continues to build the deferred.\nMatt Stotler: Got it. Thanks, Kelly.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matt VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatt VanVliet: Yes. Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe Kelly, I am wondering if you could expand on the last part or maybe for Greg, in terms of the sales and marketing investments, just maybe some of the areas that you\u2019re adding the most headcount, if you can talk to maybe the two or three areas that you\u2019re seeing the most headcount growth? And then from a sales efficiency standpoint, maybe for Greg, just what kind of processes are you bringing to the table, bringing in, maybe just some different mindsets around driving that sales efficiency as we look forward and become more enterprise-focused. Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, please, Greg. Go ahead.\nGreg Tomb: Okay. So on the first part of your question, repeat it again. I heard the sales efficiency. What was the first part?\nMatt VanVliet: Just headcount, what areas are seeing the most growth areas headcount.\nGreg Tomb: Yes. No, no, that\u2019s a really good question, right? So one is we are increasing our focus up to the larger enterprise side of the house, what we call majors and enterprise, right? Because there is a lot of money there that we are just missing, we just don\u2019t have the coverage. So you\u2019ll see a lot of our investment in marketing going there. right? You\u2019ll get a flavor for that at Zoomtopia as well when you take a look at the value propositions and how we\u2019re bringing our products to market. We\u2019ve got a handful of new products that are just \u2013 they are moving faster than we thought. You saw Zoom Phone. Kelly talked about contact center. We\u2019ve got another one, IQ for sales, right? So they are all going to get extra attention. And then the other area is international, right? So international, I mean we are \u2013 we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity there, and it\u2019s untapped, and so that\u2019s getting a bigger attention from us as well. And then the last one I\u2019d mention is around our ecosystem, right? I mean, I know we don\u2019t publish much around our ecosystem, but we\u2019ve got a potential to grow our ecosystem, add partners and get that force multiplier effect out of our ecosystem.  Well and the other one was on efficiency, right? That\u2019s what you said, yes. So when you take a look at efficiency, I think the \u2013 I think we are a little two nights in how we sell our product from a discounting perspective, right? So I think we\u2019ve got the ability to be a little smarter about how we price and discount our products. And then, again, it\u2019s making sure we\u2019re deploying our sales resources in the right place, right? So we don\u2019t need to be stuck in certain boundaries because that\u2019s how we set up coming into the year, our structure and how we manage the sales organization. We can be much smarter now on how we deploy those resources to get the biggest return on those resources, which we are looking at right now.\nMatt VanVliet: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nGreg Tomb: I don\u2019t know, Eric, do you want to add to that at all?\nEric Yuan: That\u2019s good. Thank you.\nGreg Tomb: Okay.\nOperator: And moving on to Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: Alright. Thank you everyone for taking my question. I just wanted to dial a little bit more into some of the wins that you\u2019ve seen on the contact center side. Can you give us a little bit more color in terms of what types of customers these are? Was it a competitive process? I imagine you are in seeing one of the legacy players. But were there other CCaaS vendors in that discussion as well. Just any color you could give would be helpful? Thank you.\nGreg Tomb: Do you want to take that, Eric?\nEric Yuan: Yes, sure. But yes. Thank you, Rishi. So \u2013 and Kelly mentioned earlier, right? So \u2013 and we are still probably in early stage of the product development in the face, but actually, it\u2019s more than what we expected because as get mentioned earlier, some of the customers we saw probably they are going to deploy later on, but they did deploy and they are very, very successful. And also, we also found some new use cases like internal IT support, right, IT desk, right? And plus some other customers who deploy the Zoom meetings and Zoom Phone. They look at our platform solutions, hey, you already have a contact center. After they did a test, interesting enough, we said, it works so well. And it\u2019s also why not also deploy Zoom Contact Center as well with the seamless experience and seam back in architecture. And also we are going to be very aggressive and double down on that from Zoom\u2019s perspective because product is ready. And it will take Zoom Room for our own support team, for example, we successfully managed to replace other contact center solution with our own solution. The feedback is extremely positive. That\u2019s why it gives us more confidence, right, further boosted the team confidence, right, to sell more in the second half and then also next to the fiscal year.\nGreg Tomb: Yes. I would add. I would say, in almost every one of them, we are replacing an older legacy solution, right, one that is costly and complex. And most of them, they can\u2019t change them and they can\u2019t \u2013 they don\u2019t have the flexibility to enhance them, right? So we bring a more flexible, innovative solution that could be implemented very fast right? It is integrated with our other solutions. It is a lower cost in many cases. And people have been very positively impressed with the solution. And like Kelly said that the deals are bigger than we thought they were going to be. So yes, it\u2019s been a great two quarters now of bringing this new product to market, so we\u2019ve got some pretty high hopes.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Rishi.\nOperator: Our next question will come from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. It\u2019s fairly new, but you guys talked about the consolidation impact. What are you guys seeing with traction, specifically with Zoom One and pricing overall, especially relative to the early days of Zoom United. And Kelly, secondly, on guide, given you talked about the issue being more on the new subscription side for online, are you still assuming monthly churn for online actually gets better in the second half of the year like you were before?\nKelly Steckelberg: So let\u2019s talk about that one first. So in terms of online, we continue to see stability in the retention rates at that 16-month plus, and we will show you that chart again when we get to Analyst Day in November. And we\u2019re at about 70% of our online business now has crossed over that 16-month mark. So it\u2019s bringing a lot of stability. What we had talked about previously was we expected to see an inflection point for online in Q4. And given the reduction in the guide, it\u2019s more likely that\u2019s going to come in the first half of next year. And then in terms of the traction of Zoom One, so it\u2019s just one quarter in, but we have seen some great progress there. And I think it\u2019s serving the purpose that it\u2019s needed. I mean, Greg, you can certainly comment on that. But it\u2019s really meant to ease the buying process for our largest enterprise customers and package up the platform in a way for them that really makes sense to meet their needs.\nGreg Tomb: Yes. And I think it also just from an awareness perspective helps this extremely large customer base that we have understand that, look, we\u2019re way more than meetings. And it gives them a way to step in if they want to try Phone, for example, or to take advantage of our incredible chat functionality. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 we have an incredible chat functionality probably, Eric, you can correct me I\u2019m wrong, 70% of our customers don\u2019t even know we have one. And then when they start using it, it gets very, very pervasive. So \u2013 but it just gives us a way to show our customers that there is a lot more to this platform they can get value out of, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. So \u2013 and it gives us from a salesperson in a contractual standpoint the ability to walk in and say, what does a better contractual relationship look like with Zoom that can be stickier and longer-term. I don\u2019t know if you want to add to that, Eric.\nEric Yuan: No, it\u2019s great. Thank you, Greg.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will now hear from Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank. Matthew, go ahead.\nMatthew Niknam: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. So I want about the industry. One of the bigger incumbents in the UC and CC space seems to be hitting some elevated financial difficulty. I\u2019m just wondering what sort of opportunity that presents for you, whether it\u2019s organic or inorganic? And then just one follow-up on linearity. I think you referenced maybe some back-end loaded sales in the quarter. Any more color you can give in terms of what drove this maybe relative to some of your initial expectations a couple of months ago? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So I\u2019ll talk about the linearity first. So I think that it\u2019s just \u2013 as we said in the prepared remarks, there is two things happening, right? More and more of our deals are now coming from the enterprise, and the majority of our revenue is coming there, and we have definitely now moved beyond the pandemic buying patterns. So our linearity had been much more moderated, I would say, over the last 2.5 years as the online business itself is more balanced within the quarter just by its nature. And then the enterprise business even itself, during the pandemic buying period, it didn\u2019t follow the sort of normal deal cycles that we had seen. There were less proof of concepts. There were less review, honestly. And now that has really all shifted back. And so it\u2019s just taken us, I think, a little bit of time to understand exactly where we were in that cycle. And we really saw that we\u2019re back to pre-pandemic linearity, which is very normal, right, for a SaaS business. It just hasn\u2019t been normal for us for the last few years.\nEric Yuan: Yes. I can address that organic growth or maybe the M&A opportunity. I think as you look at the UC and CC, the customer experience is extremely important, right? And you look at how we build our Phone business, right, in less than 3 years, 4 million paid seats, right? And that\u2019s the reason why we know actually our team, we can build a better product. Why not can we double down on that, right? It takes some time, but it\u2019s organic growth. It can help us build a better product ultimately can make our customers and happier. I think we should continue that. Occasionally, for sure, some technology or some other areas, we also like to explore like recently acquired Solvvy team. This is a great asset to us, will further help us the contact center business, and also we will keep eye on that as well, right. But ultimately, direction-wise, I think we have high confidence about our product teams\u2019 execution. We think we can build a much better new service.\nMatthew Niknam: Great. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Mathew.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now hear from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi. This is Strecker on for Alex. Thanks for taking my question. Kelly, I would like to unpack the Enterprise segment a little bit more. So, just to be clear, is the growth coming more from ramping reps or selling back into the base with IQ and filing the contact center? And then given you maintain the 20% plus growth target, is it fair to for us to assume that you have not contemplated any lengthening of sales cycles or a worsening macro into this line? And then lastly, can you just frame how we should think about the sustainability of this growth beyond this year, because the guidance does imply some deceleration while on easier comps in the back half? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, as I said in the prepared remarks, we have assumed that the linearity that we saw occurring in Q2 is consistent for the rest of the year. So, any of the back-end loaded, right, it will contribute less revenue to this year in each of the individual quarters, so we have assumed that\u2019s a similar trend for the rest of the year. In terms of future growth, we are not prepared to comment on that. We will do that when we give full year guidance later this year. And then the growth is \u2013 honestly, it\u2019s coming from both, as you heard earlier, continuing to expand into our customers. So, expansion, Zoom Phone, Zoom IQ, Zoom Contact Center, especially also Zoom Rooms, had a fairly strong quarter as people are still thinking about the future of hybrid work and what does that mean for them. And we are continuing to see at least \u2013 I think in Q2, the percentage of ramped reps was higher than ramping reps, and that always is a positive contribution.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thanks. And then just a quick follow-up, what have you seen in 3Q so far in terms of SMB and enterprise bookings\u2019 linearity?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. It\u2019s so early in the quarter that we wouldn\u2019t comment on that yet.\nUnidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nOperator: Yes. Trebnick with MKM has the next question.\nCatherine Trebnick: Thank you for taking my question. You have talked quite a bit on Zoom Phone, contact center. Could you give us a little bit more detail around the Zoom Room? It seems like in this hybrid environment that would probably be getting more traction. And can you provide more color around the sales motion, if you ran any specials and who you typically displace? Thank you.\nTom McCallum: I will let you have that one, Eric.\nEric Yuan: Yes. So, I think Catherine, you are also right. I think especially when it comes to hybrid office and a hybrid work and Zoom Room is becoming more and more important, right. If you look at our functionality, feature set innovation, I think I actually be better than any other solutions all there. But however, in early this year, right, and a lot of businesses when they started exploring going back, they try to look at their confident setup and really want to make sure they have a new solution. That\u2019s the reason why they pick it up in Zoom Rooms. But also over the past several months and also we do see \u2013 and some companies also want to be conservative in what\u2019s happening on the economic front, right. And they have a big office, campus, most employee probably work remotely. And I would say it\u2019s kind of sometimes, wow, a lot of the new Zoom Rooms, and sometimes we see a slowdown. But overall, direction-wise and a lot of the companies would likely to deploy the innovative solution like Zoom Rooms and to truly improve their hybrid work experience.\nCatherine Trebnick: Alright. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Moving on to Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question. Kelly, I just wanted to unpack a little bit on the Online segment. So, what sort of trend you are seeing in the churn in the Online segment? And on the new customer acquisition, you made some changes on that one-on-one meetings now limiting to 40 minutes. It\u2019s been now more than a month. So, what sort of trends are you seeing that a free-to-paid conversion as it \u2013 has it fell below your expectation or what sort of trends?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, in terms of churn, we have certainly seen that continued to improve and stabilize. As we said \u2013 touched on this a little bit in the prepared remarks, it was a little bit better than expected, where we saw \u2013 the impact you are seeing in the forward-looking guidance is the acquisition of new customers. And again, Wendy and her team are doing an amazing job on initiatives to improve that. They just haven\u2019t had enough impact yet to offset what we are seeing in the quarter. The \u2013 for example, what you are talking about, the 40-minute limit really did help in the free-to-paid conversion, and that is considered as you look forward in the rest of our full year guidance and as well as many of the other initiatives they are working on. But when you look at the \u2013 especially in Europe, the impact we saw there as well as combined with FX and that is more concentrated \u2013 having a more concentrated impact on online than enterprise, that\u2019s what is driving the reduction in the year-over-year guidance.\nSiti Panigrahi: Great. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nOperator: Tyler Radke with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.\nTyler Radke: Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe a couple for Greg. First of all, welcome aboard. I wanted to just kind of get your perspective on the sales organization and particularly in the enterprise, just kind of how you see the pricing dynamic. Obviously, it\u2019s a competitive market. But on one hand, you are driving a lot of value for enterprise customers. So, do you think there is an opportunity for maybe higher-priced SKUs or an up-sell motion? And then secondly, if you could just comment on the enterprise customer net additions, which I think were down quite a bit sequentially and year-over-year, if there was a size mix shift driver there? Just any color would be helpful. Thank you.\nGreg Tomb: Okay. I mean I will take the first one. Kelly, I will give you the second one on the details. I mean our number of customers did go up in the high end, but I will let you cover that. So, from a value perspective, I don\u2019t see us bringing out higher-level SKUs. What I do see us doing though is doing a much better job of describing and articulating the value proposition we bring to the customer and building business cases for the large enterprises so they can make a bigger purchase with us so we don\u2019t have to discount as much, okay. I think we have got \u2013 we are doing really great in the enterprise, but I don\u2019t think we are doing really great at really selling Hyatt at Board level, CEO level and being really smart about how we construct our business cases and value. And that\u2019s something that we are going to work to improve on, which I think will have a really big impact. So, we have got some work to do with our sales force and from a training perspective. But I \u2013 we just did a really big training exercise about two weeks ago and already started some of this, and it was received extremely well with our sales force. So, I mean what we don\u2019t want to do is be like our competition and just try to win on giving big discounts and giving away free stuff. That\u2019s not what we are about.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. And then in terms of the growth of the enterprise customer base, so as a reminder, the selling strategy for Zoom Phone, for contact center or Zoom IQ sales is to sell into the existing installed base. And so going forward, especially as you continue to see great progress in those products, you are going to see growth continuing to come from our existing installed base with layering on of new customers on top of that. So, you should not be surprised to see that customer count declining even while our revenue is growing.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: Karl Keirstead with UBS has the next question.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. Kelly, this one for you. So, we and I think a lot of investors on this call anchor our valuation models for Zoom shares in your free cash flow numbers. So, free cash flow for 2Q, obviously, it came in a little bit light, and your guidance for the full year is several hundred million below, I think the Street consensus. So, it would be good to understand that a little bit more. So, I guess I wanted to ask you, if you could just pinpoint the factors, maybe weighing on cash flow. And then as everybody models out into next year, are there any key things to keep in mind? Are there any sort of one-time weights that might be alleviated next year? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Thank you for asking. So, just as a quick reminder, we have actually never sort of officially guided towards free cash flow, but we understand this is very difficult to model so we are trying to give more insights to it. The biggest change that we are trying to help everyone understand is that we have now fully utilized all of our NOLs, and we are a full cash taxpayer, and so that is having a large impact. And in fact, in Q2, the way it normally falls, right, is we actually paid two quarters\u2019 worth of taxes in one quarter because you pay like the Q1 estimated provision. You pay that in April, and so we had double the impact. So, it\u2019s $200 million to $250 million worth of cash taxes that are now reflected in that. And the other thing to consider is there is one other impact that is driving up our cash tax rate, which is as our stock price has declined, we typically get a tax deduction for things called disqualifying disposition, which is when employees sell their stock. As the stock price has declined, you can imagine employees are holding on until they see potentially greater value in their stock. And so our disqualifying dispositions have dropped. At the same time, we have used up our NOLs, which means our tax rate has gone up and our cash taxes have gone up a little bit. So, we expect that to moderate as we regain value in the stock price over time.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. And then, Kelly, just in terms of next year, anything one-time about everything you just said, or should we assume somewhat similar free cash flow margins next year? I don\u2019t want to corner you in the guidance, maybe just talk through variables.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Well, I think the biggest \u2013 I mean we are going to be a cash taxpayer from now on, right. That is done. I think that the question is what happens with the disqualifying dispositions, which is a variable deduction, which will largely correlate likely with a potential increase in our stock price over time and how much employees are selling their stock.\nKarl Keirstead: Got it. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Alright. Thank you, Karl.\nOperator: Joining us again is Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Kash, please go ahead.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi Kash.\nKash Rangan: Hello Kelly, Eric and Greg. Thank you. If you look at the business, if you look at the core work minus the phone, call center, and the IQ and sales, how is that part of the business trending? I mean are you at a point where inclusive of the online channel, things seem to be stabilizing? And how do we look at the mix of business, incoming business over the intermediate term or maybe in the near-term as the year unfolds between the core versus the phone product and non-video products? Thank you so much.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. I mean the Zoom Phone was certainly the star, if you will, of Q2, but we continue to see strength in our core meetings platform. It had really strong growth in the period as well, and the majority of our business in online is still core meetings as well. So, the majority of that business is coming from core meetings. And the work \u2013 all the work that team is doing to continue to improve the free to convert paid \u2013 the free-to-paid conversion will continue to drive more strength in the meetings business as well.\nKash Rangan: But is there a way to really need what the core is doing minus the phones? The phone is a separate revenue pricing.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Kash, we don\u2019t break it out that way. What we have always said is from a revenue perspective, we will start to bring out \u2013 break out these products when they hit their 10% of revenue. You can imagine, we are getting very close on Zoom Phone. So, I think in the next couple of quarters, you will likely start to see that, which will give you some insight.\nKash Rangan: Great. Thank you so much.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Thank you, Kash.\nOperator: I am moving on to Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark.\nMatthew Harrigan: Well. Thank you. Could you be a little more expansive on the region [Technical Difficulty] in APAC up 10%, even the free fall in the yen and some other Asian currencies being weak. Do you have a reasonable buffer to decides to turn off, toggle off North Stream 1 when we get to winter? And then lastly, I think you alluded a little \u2013 touched on this a little bit earlier. But can you talk about any variation in the online versus enterprise activity by geography? Is it fairly different in Asia and Europe from the Americas? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay. Let me take the last one first. So, in terms of online, online certainly has been the most impacted in EMEA. So, that\u2019s where \u2013 when we talk about the guidance, some of the impact it\u2019s having there, between FX in general and the Russia-Ukraine war, it\u2019s having much more of an impact on online than it is in our enterprise business. And then \u2013 I am sorry, I didn\u2019t quite catch the first part of your question.\nMatthew Harrigan: On APAC, you were up 10% in U.S. dollars in that region even though currency is similarly to the euro, I mean with Japanese yen. So look, we have had a very strong organic APAC result in certain markets.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. I mean Greg, feel free to join in. But yes, we did see strength, especially in Japan. We had a very strong Q2 there.\nMatthew Harrigan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Moving on to Ryan Koontz with Needham.\nRyan Koontz: Thanks for the question. Just a follow-up on the last one about Europe and the kind of online headwinds you are seeing there. Any geographic variance within Europe, you can comment on? Is it continent wide? Is it more Eastern Europe, way? Any kind of color you can give us there would be helpful. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes, it\u2019s pretty pervasive, unfortunately, across the continent that we have seen it as you can tell based on the magnitude of the impact.\nRyan Koontz: Yes. Alright. Thanks Kelly.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Peter Levine with Evercore.\nPeter Levine: Great. Thank you for squeezing me in here. Maybe Eric or Kelly, just to tack on another question with contact center, can you kind of explain to us where we are with the product today in terms of standing up against the Five 9s and Genesis and the Knights of the World? And then second, if you look out over the next 12 months, 24 months, what\u2019s going to differentiate Zoom Contact Center to kind of get customers to take a second look. And I know squeezing it third here. But Kelly, in your prior \u2013 one of your prior questions, you mentioned the seat count was higher for contact center. Can you just give us an average seat count for contact center today if you will to do that? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Eric, do you want to take the first couple?\nEric Yuan: Sure. Absolutely. Peter, if you look at our contact center, right, as I mentioned earlier, right, customer experience is extremely important, right. We built this new solution, it\u2019s not like any other solutions, nobody on-prem or the cloud visit solution. That \u2013 those solutions were built many years ago, right. So, this is more the interface, and we already service the customer feedback. We know what they really wanted to have and also a much better integration with our core UC product as well, like Zoom Phone. And quite often, when we talk about phone customer, hey, you already have a contact center right now, right. And that\u2019s one of the aspect of the innovation and also look at some functionality feature set, right. You can talk on the video. And also more and more AI features as well and also the AI and video and more interface. And I think plus, I think ultimately, we already won the customer trust. They know and we listen to the customer feedback very carefully whenever they have some new feature requests or anything, we can innovate much faster. That\u2019s the reason why I think customers, they are willing to try a Zoom Contact Center, also starting to deploy Zoom Contact Center.\nGreg Tomb: And then Kelly, anything on the seat count?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. What I would say is, I think I am just looking at a list of deals right here on the screen, and I think that we probably moved into at least the average seat size being in the triple digits. So, we have our largest deal approaching four digits, I would say, and then probably on average is in that triple digit size right now.\nPeter Levine: Thank you very much.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nGreg Tomb: I mean the one thing I would add, and it\u2019s probably not a lot of commentary now, but we will be showcasing a lot of these customers at Zoomtopia, right. So, we will get you have a lot \u2013 if you attend any of that or have anybody attend that or you hear what\u2019s coming out of it, you will get a lot of contact center details.\nOperator: Thanks Peter. And we will move on to our next question, which will come from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo Securities.\nMichael Turrin: Thanks and I really want to appreciate you for taking me on as the next caller of the earnings call. Kelly, you had some helpful quantifications on the major segments of the business and the drivers. On the enterprise side, those comments around more back-end weighted linearity. It sounds pretty clear you are assuming a similar shape hold. But in terms of quarterly versus rest of year, I know 4Q purchasing decision cycles in enterprise are often significant. Maybe you can just add more around the visibility you have into the Enterprise segment, the renewal base there. I think investors would just greatly appreciate any commentary around the degrees of precision you have with enterprise versus online.\nKelly Steckelberg: Sure. So, as a reminder, our up-market teams, both majors and enterprise that Greg talked about earlier are on six-month quotas. So, again, now that we are sort of beyond pandemic buying periods and we have returned to a more normalized seasonality, which sees peaks in bookings in Q2 and in Q4. So, everybody should expect \u2013 for example, we had this discussion in Q1 as well. Like we \u2013 if you remember, our last record quarter for Zoom Phone was in Q4. And then we talked about it, the seat count was actually acquired during Q1 was down, and now we are having another record in Q2. So, everybody should expect that, that\u2019s kind of the seasonality we are going to see as we add these reps all running to achieve their accelerators in Q2 and in Q4. And again, that\u2019s sort of just a typical enterprise seasonality that we are going to see based on the way our comp lines are structured.\nMichael Turrin: Thank you.\nOperator: Alright. We have time for one additional question. Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays, please go ahead.\nRyan MacWilliams: And Eric, I just want to say I solved the acquisition of our new contact center. Looks really interesting, so look and see work there. Kelly, two for you, just on enterprise additions for the rest of this year. Should we think that the bulk of that is coming from Zoom Phone net seat adds? And then just as we think about maturing base of your existing meetings customers, right, is that additive to growth at this point? Like do you have a sense of where the ZIP code for that net expansion rate is?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, I think enterprise additions for the second half will not be just Zoom Phone. I mean Zoom Phone is certainly very strong momentum that we are seeing, but we expect continued contribution from Zoom Rooms will certainly be strong. Contact center, we expect to continue growing as well as Zoom IQ. So, that all of those will continue to add to the overall growth in the enterprise along with we continue to see additions in meetings as well. And then, yes, so in a maturity basis, the enterprise meetings, especially internationally, continues to grow. Like don\u2019t underestimate or don\u2019t assume that sort of the maturity level of video adoption that we see here in the U.S. is at the same level on an international basis, and there is still significant opportunity outside of the U.S. to continue to grow our core meetings platform.\nRyan MacWilliams: Appreciate the color. Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Alright. Thank you.\nOperator: Well, thank you to everyone who stayed on with us a little late today. Again, that does conclude our Q&A session for today. Kelly, I will go ahead and turn it back to you for closing or additional remarks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you. Thank you so much, everyone, for joining us today and appreciating \u2013 we really appreciate all the support that you give us every day.\nOperator: Thank you so much, Kelly. And again everyone that does conclude today\u2019s earnings release. We always thank you all so much for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day. We will see you next quarter.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Kelcey.\nOperator: You\u2019re welcome.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric and thank you everyone for joining us today. Let me start with what's on everyone's mind, the macro environments. Zoom is not immune to the global downturn, but the situation is more complex than meets the eye. Our enterprise business continued to post strong growth, which we believe is because cloud migration and digital transformation continue to be a priority even when and perhaps especially when the economy slows. The headwinds we saw mainly relate to the strengthening dollar, new online subscriptions and to a lesser extent, bookings linearity. We have implemented initiatives focused on driving new online subscriptions, which have shown early promise but were not enough to overcome the macro dynamics in the quarter. We believe Zoom remains well positioned in this environment as customers look to increase productivity and collaboration while moving away from expensive legacy vendors. Our products are designed to drive efficiency and cost savings within organizations and are loved by both their employees and their customers. In addition, we have strong margins and cash flows as well as a large cash balance. Even still, we are taking a prudent and cautious approach in this environment with focused investments and hiring to drive innovation and customer happiness. Our platform strategy is playing out very well and Zoom Rooms and Zoom Phone are critical components of that strategy. In fact, Zoom Phone was a real star in Q2, hitting several milestones. The number of customers with 10,000 or more paid seats increased 112% year-over-year. In addition, we broke our record for the largest Zoom Phone deal twice in the quarter, first with a global retailer and then with a global bank, both with more than 125,000 seats. Deals like these led Zoom Phone to post a record quarter and surpassed 4 million seats in August. We are also seeing early traction for Zoom Contact Center and Zoom IQ for sales. Zoom Contact Center is only 6 months old, but has already had deal sizes reach seats that we did not expect until its second year. And customers value the user-friendly interface, efficiency gains and savings they see in shifting to our modern cloud-based AI-driven contact center solutions. We are proud of the team that drove these results and I am thrilled to have Greg with us today. Greg joined last quarter as our new President leading our go-to-market teams and the office of the Global CIO. He brings a wealth of leadership experience scaling bellwether Internet and enterprise companies. Greg, welcome to our call today. We would love to have you introduce some customer wins for the quarter. Thank you, Greg. Now let me turn to the quarter's results and guidance. In Q2, total revenue grew 8% year-over-year to $1.099 billion, approximately $16 million below the low-end of our quarterly guidance. A stronger U.S. dollar, which had an impact of approximately $8 million, weaker new online sales, and to a lesser extent, back-end linearity in the quarter, were the biggest factors contributing to the miss. We recognize that the revenue results are disappointing and below our expectations as we navigate the current environment. It should be noted that while our online business saw lower new subscriptions, renewals and online continued to improve. And as we just discussed, we have launched a number of initiatives to drive new online subscriptions around local pricing, packaging and free-to-paid conversion. The growth in revenue was primarily driven by strength in our enterprise business. Revenue from enterprise customers grew 27% year-over-year and represented 54% of total revenue, up from 46% a year ago. We expect revenue from enterprise customers to become an increasingly higher percentage of total revenue over time. From a product perspective, we had strong growth in Zoom Meetings and Zoom Phone, coupled with contributions from Zoom Rooms and other products. The number of enterprise customers grew 18% year-over-year to approximately 204,100. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for enterprise customers in Q2 came in at a healthy 120%. We saw 37% year-over-year growth in the upmarket as we ended the quarter with 3,116 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represented 26% of revenue, up from 20% in Q2 of FY \u201822. As the majority of our revenue has shifted back to the enterprise and we have moved beyond the pandemic buying patterns, we are returning to more normalized enterprise sales cycles with linearity weighted towards the back end of the quarter. This contributed to higher than expected deferred revenue in Q2. And as we believe this customer behavior will persist, we have factored it into our outlook. Our Americas and APAC revenue grew 12% and 10% year-over-year respectively. EMEA continues to be impacted by the Russia-Ukraine war, the strengthening dollar and online performance, which led to an 8% year-over-year revenue decline. Now turning to profitability. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities and all tax effects resulting from non-GAAP adjustments. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 78.9%, an improvement from 76.2% in Q2 of last year and 78.6% last quarter. The sequential improvement was mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our increasing number of co-located data centers. Given the improvements we are seeing so far this year, we expect gross margins to be approximately 78% for the remainder of the year, which is higher than our previous view. Research and development expense grew by 81% year-over-year to approximately $98 million, driven by our focus on innovation. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 8.9% from 5.3% in Q2 of last year. Our expanding product portfolio reflects our ongoing investments in building out Zoom's platform and delivering on our customers' evolving needs. We plan to further invest in R&D to reach our long-term target of 10% to 12% of total revenue. Sales and marketing expense grew by 35% year-over-year to $286 million. This represented approximately 26% of total revenue, up from 20.7% in Q2 of last year. We are committed to investing in growth areas, including sales capacity, channel partner enablement and product marketing. G&A expense grew by 2% to $90 million or approximately 8.2% of total revenue. Non-GAAP operating income expanded to $394 million, exceeding the high-end of our guidance of $365 million as we continue to thoughtfully prioritize investments. This translates to a 35.8% non-GAAP operating margin for Q2 compared with 41.6% a year ago and 37.2% last quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.05 on approximately 307 million weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.13 above the high-end of our guidance. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.4 billion, up 19% year-over-year from $1.2 billion. This result was meaningfully higher than what we previously forecasted due to the strong enterprise bookings, which are back-end weighted in the quarter. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $3.2 billion, up 37% year-over-year from $2.3 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 61% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 69% in Q2 of last year, reflecting a shift towards longer term plans. As a reminder, our seasonality of renewals is front-end loaded and moderates over the rest of the year, reflecting the sequentially smaller renewal base. As such, we expect Q3 deferred revenue to grow at approximately 13% to 14% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We have purchased $426 million of stock, representing 4.1 million shares over the last two quarters as part of our $1 billion repurchase program. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $257 million as compared to $468 million in Q2 of last year. Adjusted free cash flow was $222 million as compared to $455 million in Q2 of last year. Our margins for operating cash flow and adjusted free cash flow were 23.4% and 20.2% respectively. As previously discussed, these metrics include a large cash outflow from an increase in cash taxes starting in Q2. As we update our full year outlook for the P&L and take into account the lower tax deductions for stock-based compensation caused by the lower stock price, we would expect adjusted free cash flow to be between $1 billion to $1.15 billion. Now turning to guidance. This outlook is consistent with what we are observing in the market today. Specifically, it assumes that our enterprise business will grow in the low to mid-20s, while our online business will decline 7% to 8% for the year as compared to the previously provided flat outlook. For the third quarter of FY \u201823, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.095 billion to $1.1 billion. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $325 million to $330 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.82 to $0.83 based on approximately 306 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY \u201823, we now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.385 billion to $4.395 billion, which would represent approximately 7% year-over-year growth. At the midpoint, this represents a decrease of approximately $150 million as compared to our previous full year guidance. Of this decrease, approximately $35 million is due to the stronger dollar and $115 million is attributable to the broader macroeconomic environment. We now expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $1.44 billion to $1.45 billion. We are still targeting a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 33% as we have adjusted spending in the second half to focus on high ROI areas and have seen a modest benefit to expenses from FX. Our tax rate is expected to approximate the blended U.S. federal and state rate. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $3.66 to $3.69 based on approximately 307 million shares outstanding. Before opening up for Q&A, we are excited to share our Zoomtopia event with you. It is our premier user conference and will be run on Zoom Events. We look forward to sharing our platform strategy, new innovations and customer testimonials. Please join us at Zoomtopia and our Investor Day on November 8. Zoom remains focused on building out our platform, leading in the hybrid work world, enhancing the customer experience and expanding into more and more business workflows. We will continue to make strategic moves to drive future growth as we navigate the current environment. Thank you to the Zoom team, which has grown to 8,000 strong, our customers, our community and our investors. Kelcey, please queue up our first question. Yes. The majority of that is really coming from online, William. So when you look at the difference in the guidance and previously, we had expected online to be approximately flat for the year and now we are saying it's going to be in the range of 7% to 8% down, that's really where the majority of that is coming from on a base of about $2 billion. That's where we're seeing it. We continue to see strength in the enterprise, which you can see as the increase in deferred. We are moving more towards back-end linearity, which had some impact on the revenue, but we continue to see great work done by our enterprise team and getting those deals in just a little bit later in the quarter. Yes. Greg, do you want to talk about that? So I think we touched on this. I'm going to start with your second question first. We touched on this in the Q1 call as well. We will continue as a company to focus on the areas that drive innovation. So that really means R&D as well as driving growth. So that's sales ops. And we have taken the tack for a while now of trying to be as efficient as we can around cost of goods sold and, of course, G&A to the extent that, of course, we always want to ensure the product and the platform is reliable and we're supporting our customers' needs but trying to do that as efficiently as we can. And in fact, we indicated in the prepared remarks, we expect gross margins to come in a little bit higher than what we had previously at 7 8% for the rest of the year.  And then in terms of online, Wendy and her team have just done an amazing job of really thinking about how do we continue to improve the conversion rate of free-to-pay. They have done that through different initiatives, especially including pricing and packaging on a global basis. And we've seen retention rates continue to improve as well as conversion rates. We just \u2013 the sort of the challenge that we're seeing overall in the online business is new customer additions. But as they continue to focus on the initiatives, I'm sure that will improve our time as well. Sure. So let me talk about the net dollar expansion, then I'll let Greg or Eric talk about new customers. But we have said for a while, when you remember that the strategy for selling Zoom Phone and Zoom Rooms, contact center, etcetera, is to sell into our existing installed base. It's exactly as you said. We continue to see some of our largest customers continue to expand. Some of those Zoom Phone wins moved our customers. We \u2013 when you go back and look at the customer count of how many \u2013 the growth rates that we saw and greater than 100,000 trailing 12 months, like it's really significant growth, which supports exactly what you're saying. And as a reminder, the net dollar expansion number now is focused on just the Enterprise portion of our business. It doesn't include the online segment of the business. But Greg or Eric, would you either be like to just touch on new customers for the quarter? Yes. We're not going to break out FX down to that level of detail. But what I will say, if you step all the way back \u2013 and we talked about this in the Q1 call as well. If you look at the impact that FX and the war in Europe is having on the year-over-year growth, it's 200 basis points. So you can think about there is 2 full percentage points of impact coming from things that are kind of out of our control from both FX and the war on the total year-over-year growth rate. We definitely had a strong Q2 in terms of enterprise sales. That \u2013 you can see reflected in the deferred. It just came later in the quarter, which is why it didn't really have impact on revenue within the quarter. But we continue to \u2013 all the things we've talked about, right? Zoom Phone having incredible strength and performance in the quarter, really already seeing momentum in contact center this early. 6 months in we have some remarkable names that have signed up for contact center that we will be excited to share with you at some point in the future. But already, the seat sizes that we're seeing for contact center, I think we would not have expected them to come from in their 18 to 24 months yet. So I think all of that shows that the platform transition is really working very, very well and that customers continue to love and see the efficiency they get from Zoom. And especially as they are thinking about \u2013 maybe, Greg, you can talk about this. Sort of what I heard from the sales team is these transition of deals moving from the CIO to the CFO and customers really being thoughtful about the cost there, and Zoom competes very well when it's competitively priced. The other thing that I would just highlight is we also continue to see strength in movement from monthly to annual contracts in both our online as well as our enterprise business. And as you know, that really helps from a retention perspective and also continues to build the deferred. Yes, please, Greg. Go ahead. Thank you, Rishi. So let's talk about that one first. So in terms of online, we continue to see stability in the retention rates at that 16-month plus, and we will show you that chart again when we get to Analyst Day in November. And we're at about 70% of our online business now has crossed over that 16-month mark. So it's bringing a lot of stability. What we had talked about previously was we expected to see an inflection point for online in Q4. And given the reduction in the guide, it's more likely that's going to come in the first half of next year. And then in terms of the traction of Zoom One, so it's just one quarter in, but we have seen some great progress there. And I think it's serving the purpose that it's needed. I mean, Greg, you can certainly comment on that. But it's really meant to ease the buying process for our largest enterprise customers and package up the platform in a way for them that really makes sense to meet their needs. So I'll talk about the linearity first. So I think that it's just \u2013 as we said in the prepared remarks, there is two things happening, right? More and more of our deals are now coming from the enterprise, and the majority of our revenue is coming there, and we have definitely now moved beyond the pandemic buying patterns. So our linearity had been much more moderated, I would say, over the last 2.5 years as the online business itself is more balanced within the quarter just by its nature. And then the enterprise business even itself, during the pandemic buying period, it didn't follow the sort of normal deal cycles that we had seen. There were less proof of concepts. There were less review, honestly. And now that has really all shifted back. And so it's just taken us, I think, a little bit of time to understand exactly where we were in that cycle. And we really saw that we're back to pre-pandemic linearity, which is very normal, right, for a SaaS business. It just hasn't been normal for us for the last few years. So, as I said in the prepared remarks, we have assumed that the linearity that we saw occurring in Q2 is consistent for the rest of the year. So, any of the back-end loaded, right, it will contribute less revenue to this year in each of the individual quarters, so we have assumed that's a similar trend for the rest of the year. In terms of future growth, we are not prepared to comment on that. We will do that when we give full year guidance later this year. And then the growth is \u2013 honestly, it's coming from both, as you heard earlier, continuing to expand into our customers. So, expansion, Zoom Phone, Zoom IQ, Zoom Contact Center, especially also Zoom Rooms, had a fairly strong quarter as people are still thinking about the future of hybrid work and what does that mean for them. And we are continuing to see at least \u2013 I think in Q2, the percentage of ramped reps was higher than ramping reps, and that always is a positive contribution. Yes. It's so early in the quarter that we wouldn't comment on that yet. Yes. Yes. So, in terms of churn, we have certainly seen that continued to improve and stabilize. As we said \u2013 touched on this a little bit in the prepared remarks, it was a little bit better than expected, where we saw \u2013 the impact you are seeing in the forward-looking guidance is the acquisition of new customers. And again, Wendy and her team are doing an amazing job on initiatives to improve that. They just haven't had enough impact yet to offset what we are seeing in the quarter. The \u2013 for example, what you are talking about, the 40-minute limit really did help in the free-to-paid conversion, and that is considered as you look forward in the rest of our full year guidance and as well as many of the other initiatives they are working on. But when you look at the \u2013 especially in Europe, the impact we saw there as well as combined with FX and that is more concentrated \u2013 having a more concentrated impact on online than enterprise, that's what is driving the reduction in the year-over-year guidance. Yes. Yes. And then in terms of the growth of the enterprise customer base, so as a reminder, the selling strategy for Zoom Phone, for contact center or Zoom IQ sales is to sell into the existing installed base. And so going forward, especially as you continue to see great progress in those products, you are going to see growth continuing to come from our existing installed base with layering on of new customers on top of that. So, you should not be surprised to see that customer count declining even while our revenue is growing. Yes. Thank you for asking. So, just as a quick reminder, we have actually never sort of officially guided towards free cash flow, but we understand this is very difficult to model so we are trying to give more insights to it. The biggest change that we are trying to help everyone understand is that we have now fully utilized all of our NOLs, and we are a full cash taxpayer, and so that is having a large impact. And in fact, in Q2, the way it normally falls, right, is we actually paid two quarters' worth of taxes in one quarter because you pay like the Q1 estimated provision. You pay that in April, and so we had double the impact. So, it's $200 million to $250 million worth of cash taxes that are now reflected in that. And the other thing to consider is there is one other impact that is driving up our cash tax rate, which is as our stock price has declined, we typically get a tax deduction for things called disqualifying disposition, which is when employees sell their stock. As the stock price has declined, you can imagine employees are holding on until they see potentially greater value in their stock. And so our disqualifying dispositions have dropped. At the same time, we have used up our NOLs, which means our tax rate has gone up and our cash taxes have gone up a little bit. So, we expect that to moderate as we regain value in the stock price over time. Yes. Well, I think the biggest \u2013 I mean we are going to be a cash taxpayer from now on, right. That is done. I think that the question is what happens with the disqualifying dispositions, which is a variable deduction, which will largely correlate likely with a potential increase in our stock price over time and how much employees are selling their stock. Alright. Thank you, Karl. Hi Kash. Yes. I mean the Zoom Phone was certainly the star, if you will, of Q2, but we continue to see strength in our core meetings platform. It had really strong growth in the period as well, and the majority of our business in online is still core meetings as well. So, the majority of that business is coming from core meetings. And the work \u2013 all the work that team is doing to continue to improve the free to convert paid \u2013 the free-to-paid conversion will continue to drive more strength in the meetings business as well. Yes. Kash, we don't break it out that way. What we have always said is from a revenue perspective, we will start to bring out \u2013 break out these products when they hit their 10% of revenue. You can imagine, we are getting very close on Zoom Phone. So, I think in the next couple of quarters, you will likely start to see that, which will give you some insight. Yes. Thank you, Kash. Okay. Let me take the last one first. So, in terms of online, online certainly has been the most impacted in EMEA. So, that's where \u2013 when we talk about the guidance, some of the impact it's having there, between FX in general and the Russia-Ukraine war, it's having much more of an impact on online than it is in our enterprise business. And then \u2013 I am sorry, I didn't quite catch the first part of your question. Yes. I mean Greg, feel free to join in. But yes, we did see strength, especially in Japan. We had a very strong Q2 there. Yes, it's pretty pervasive, unfortunately, across the continent that we have seen it as you can tell based on the magnitude of the impact. Eric, do you want to take the first couple? Yes. What I would say is, I think I am just looking at a list of deals right here on the screen, and I think that we probably moved into at least the average seat size being in the triple digits. So, we have our largest deal approaching four digits, I would say, and then probably on average is in that triple digit size right now. Yes. Sure. So, as a reminder, our up-market teams, both majors and enterprise that Greg talked about earlier are on six-month quotas. So, again, now that we are sort of beyond pandemic buying periods and we have returned to a more normalized seasonality, which sees peaks in bookings in Q2 and in Q4. So, everybody should expect \u2013 for example, we had this discussion in Q1 as well. Like we \u2013 if you remember, our last record quarter for Zoom Phone was in Q4. And then we talked about it, the seat count was actually acquired during Q1 was down, and now we are having another record in Q2. So, everybody should expect that, that's kind of the seasonality we are going to see as we add these reps all running to achieve their accelerators in Q2 and in Q4. And again, that's sort of just a typical enterprise seasonality that we are going to see based on the way our comp lines are structured. Yes. So, I think enterprise additions for the second half will not be just Zoom Phone. I mean Zoom Phone is certainly very strong momentum that we are seeing, but we expect continued contribution from Zoom Rooms will certainly be strong. Contact center, we expect to continue growing as well as Zoom IQ. So, that all of those will continue to add to the overall growth in the enterprise along with we continue to see additions in meetings as well. And then, yes, so in a maturity basis, the enterprise meetings, especially internationally, continues to grow. Like don't underestimate or don't assume that sort of the maturity level of video adoption that we see here in the U.S. is at the same level on an international basis, and there is still significant opportunity outside of the U.S. to continue to grow our core meetings platform. Alright. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much, everyone, for joining us today and appreciating \u2013 we really appreciate all the support that you give us every day. Thank you, Kelcey."

            "content": "Thank you, Tom and thank you everyone for joining us today. I am on the road now and my Internet access is limited. I will hand my remarks to Kelly and Greg and join you all for the Q&A portion. Thank you. Hi, Meta. Yes, sure, sure. Just quickly. So Peter, if you look at the Q2, right? Look at our enterprise wins doing very well. Just a very, very big and healthcare organization, they deploy Zoom not only for Phone but also for telemedicine as well. And we do see a lot of new opportunities like that just so \u2013 and it's doing extremely well on the enterprise front. That's good. Thank you. Yes, sure. But yes. Thank you, Rishi. So \u2013 and Kelly mentioned earlier, right? So \u2013 and we are still probably in early stage of the product development in the face, but actually, it's more than what we expected because as get mentioned earlier, some of the customers we saw probably they are going to deploy later on, but they did deploy and they are very, very successful. And also, we also found some new use cases like internal IT support, right, IT desk, right? And plus some other customers who deploy the Zoom meetings and Zoom Phone. They look at our platform solutions, hey, you already have a contact center. After they did a test, interesting enough, we said, it works so well. And it's also why not also deploy Zoom Contact Center as well with the seamless experience and seam back in architecture. And also we are going to be very aggressive and double down on that from Zoom's perspective because product is ready. And it will take Zoom Room for our own support team, for example, we successfully managed to replace other contact center solution with our own solution. The feedback is extremely positive. That's why it gives us more confidence, right, further boosted the team confidence, right, to sell more in the second half and then also next to the fiscal year. No, it's great. Thank you, Greg. Yes. I can address that organic growth or maybe the M&A opportunity. I think as you look at the UC and CC, the customer experience is extremely important, right? And you look at how we build our Phone business, right, in less than 3 years, 4 million paid seats, right? And that's the reason why we know actually our team, we can build a better product. Why not can we double down on that, right? It takes some time, but it's organic growth. It can help us build a better product ultimately can make our customers and happier. I think we should continue that. Occasionally, for sure, some technology or some other areas, we also like to explore like recently acquired Solvvy team. This is a great asset to us, will further help us the contact center business, and also we will keep eye on that as well, right. But ultimately, direction-wise, I think we have high confidence about our product teams' execution. We think we can build a much better new service. Thank you, Mathew. Yes. So, I think Catherine, you are also right. I think especially when it comes to hybrid office and a hybrid work and Zoom Room is becoming more and more important, right. If you look at our functionality, feature set innovation, I think I actually be better than any other solutions all there. But however, in early this year, right, and a lot of businesses when they started exploring going back, they try to look at their confident setup and really want to make sure they have a new solution. That's the reason why they pick it up in Zoom Rooms. But also over the past several months and also we do see \u2013 and some companies also want to be conservative in what's happening on the economic front, right. And they have a big office, campus, most employee probably work remotely. And I would say it's kind of sometimes, wow, a lot of the new Zoom Rooms, and sometimes we see a slowdown. But overall, direction-wise and a lot of the companies would likely to deploy the innovative solution like Zoom Rooms and to truly improve their hybrid work experience. Thank you. Sure. Absolutely. Peter, if you look at our contact center, right, as I mentioned earlier, right, customer experience is extremely important, right. We built this new solution, it's not like any other solutions, nobody on-prem or the cloud visit solution. That \u2013 those solutions were built many years ago, right. So, this is more the interface, and we already service the customer feedback. We know what they really wanted to have and also a much better integration with our core UC product as well, like Zoom Phone. And quite often, when we talk about phone customer, hey, you already have a contact center right now, right. And that's one of the aspect of the innovation and also look at some functionality feature set, right. You can talk on the video. And also more and more AI features as well and also the AI and video and more interface. And I think plus, I think ultimately, we already won the customer trust. They know and we listen to the customer feedback very carefully whenever they have some new feature requests or anything, we can innovate much faster. That's the reason why I think customers, they are willing to try a Zoom Contact Center, also starting to deploy Zoom Contact Center."

            "name": "Greg Tomb",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Kelly and I am very happy to join today. Absolutely, Kelly. Well, hello, everyone. Very nice to meet all of you. I wish it was in person. We actually did have an exceptional sales quarter in the enterprise market and I'll let Kelly give you more details in a minute. We had a number of great new wins, including one of the largest U.S. healthcare providers out there. I can't give you their name yet, we will in the future, but they did choose Zoom Meetings and Zoom Phone to provide telehealth services to the broad number of caregivers and patients. I mean, they were just really impressed with Zoom's strong integration between video and voice to support 40,000 plus employees and their external community for a wide variety of telehealth needs. I also want to thank UCLA. And you may know this or may not, but they were recognized by U.S. News & World Report as the number one public university in the U.S. And I want to thank them, because they expanded their relationship with Zoom by adding 15,000 Zoom Phone licenses and this large investment will accelerate their journey to the cloud and will offer them the benefits of truly having a unified communications platform. The next company I want to thank is Warner Bros. Discovery, a premier global media entertainment company. I want to thank them for partnering with Zoom on its global communications needs. Our partnership actually began before the merger with Discovery and really kicked into gear once these two iconic brands merged. And they have chosen to expand their meetings and phone deployment and we are really excited to deliver for them a full integrated suite of communication services. Next, I'd like to thank Ancestry and you probably know Ancestry as the global leader when it comes to family history. I want to thank them for also expanding their relationship with Zoom. The strong customer relationship that we built during the original Zoom Meetings deployment and they also had a successful partnership with Solvvy, it allowed us to expand this to a complete platform. We included Zoom Phone. We have a scalable now conversational AI-based chat system in place and self-service capabilities from Solvvy. And last let me also thank Optiv, the cyber advisory and solutions leader. Today, they deliver strategic and technical expertise to nearly 6,000 companies across every major industry. Optiv started as a Zoom Meetings customer back in 2016, then they expanded to Zoom Phone last year, and they really appreciated how reliable and simple our integrated solutions work. And then this last quarter in Q2, they decided to replace their legacy contact center with Zoom Contact Center and it's more than 275 agents supporting roughly 90 workflows. And they were so impressed with our rapid product iteration, our roadmap for integrations with other SaaS tools as well as the ability to greatly reduce costs. So, again, I mean thank you, UCLA; thank you, Warner Bros; thank you Ancestry; thank you, Optiv and to all those customers that did business with us in Q2. We greatly appreciate it. And with that, Kelly, I'll pass it back to you. Yes, I can comment \u2013 I mean, yes, I mean Q2 was a pretty amazing quarter around Zoom Phone, extremely high win rates. And I think we exceeded the \u2013 I think you mentioned, is Kelly, the $4 million user mark, right? So to do that in 3 years is just incredible. There is a \u2013 we see a large number of our enterprise customers today looking for looking for ways to consolidate and have a more modern communication experience and the fact that it's fully integrated with video makes it a natural place to go. So I think you're going to continue to see this really big uptick in our enterprise is taking advantage of both Video and Phone together. So \u2013 and our pipeline is showing that now. Yes. Yes, I would add to what Eric and Kelly said is that I think we will continue to see that solid customer base in the enterprise expanding with us. I do think when you take a look at online, it is a little mixed because we've got a lot of individual consumers that are down there that we're looking for ways to get them to move from free to paid. And what we're doing right now seems to be working, but we've got to keep at it and continue to run additional actions. But I think we've got a really great story that's coming together on the enterprise. And from a sales perspective, we're trying to focus more and more in the enterprise on how we're going to market, how we're marketing these companies and the value proposition, again, around the whole platform. We really have a great platform story today that allows companies to have more of an integrated end-to-end communication, a modern communication platform, and they can get rid of a lot of point solutions that are \u2013 they bought 20 years ago that are causing them a lot of pain and costing a lot of money. So I think we will see this trend continue. Yes. I mean I would say it's I don't think it's surprising to anybody to think that any of these large transactions that are going through approval aren't getting that extra set of eyes from a finance perspective. But what's interesting is that we're in a world where hybrid work is not going away, right? It actually complicates things, but having a platform that supports that is really important even at the CEO level, right, because it helps them with attrition issues. It helps them hire the best people. It helps them have faster decisions, inclusive decisions. So having the right communication platform knows different than having the right decision around security or supply chain. These are just the top three or four that are sitting at the Board at the CEO level, and so they do get approved, right, I mean other than having a couple of sets of eyes and may be coming after us for a little bigger discount here or there, which delayed it a week or 2. I don't think we had anything major that slipped from quarter-to-quarter because people weren't going to spend the money. So I mean I was \u2013 I mean I've been here now for 2 months, and I was really \u2013 I mean I was personally really amazed by how strong the execution was by our sales team and how the deals that were committed flow through the process. Okay. So on the first part of your question, repeat it again. I heard the sales efficiency. What was the first part? Yes. No, no, that's a really good question, right? So one is we are increasing our focus up to the larger enterprise side of the house, what we call majors and enterprise, right? Because there is a lot of money there that we are just missing, we just don't have the coverage. So you'll see a lot of our investment in marketing going there. right? You'll get a flavor for that at Zoomtopia as well when you take a look at the value propositions and how we're bringing our products to market. We've got a handful of new products that are just \u2013 they are moving faster than we thought. You saw Zoom Phone. Kelly talked about contact center. We've got another one, IQ for sales, right? So they are all going to get extra attention. And then the other area is international, right? So international, I mean we are \u2013 we've got a lot of opportunity there, and it's untapped, and so that's getting a bigger attention from us as well. And then the last one I'd mention is around our ecosystem, right? I mean, I know we don't publish much around our ecosystem, but we've got a potential to grow our ecosystem, add partners and get that force multiplier effect out of our ecosystem.  Well and the other one was on efficiency, right? That's what you said, yes. So when you take a look at efficiency, I think the \u2013 I think we are a little two nights in how we sell our product from a discounting perspective, right? So I think we've got the ability to be a little smarter about how we price and discount our products. And then, again, it's making sure we're deploying our sales resources in the right place, right? So we don't need to be stuck in certain boundaries because that's how we set up coming into the year, our structure and how we manage the sales organization. We can be much smarter now on how we deploy those resources to get the biggest return on those resources, which we are looking at right now. I don't know, Eric, do you want to add to that at all? Okay. Do you want to take that, Eric? Yes. I would add. I would say, in almost every one of them, we are replacing an older legacy solution, right, one that is costly and complex. And most of them, they can't change them and they can't \u2013 they don't have the flexibility to enhance them, right? So we bring a more flexible, innovative solution that could be implemented very fast right? It is integrated with our other solutions. It is a lower cost in many cases. And people have been very positively impressed with the solution. And like Kelly said that the deals are bigger than we thought they were going to be. So yes, it's been a great two quarters now of bringing this new product to market, so we've got some pretty high hopes. Yes. And I think it also just from an awareness perspective helps this extremely large customer base that we have understand that, look, we're way more than meetings. And it gives them a way to step in if they want to try Phone, for example, or to take advantage of our incredible chat functionality. I mean it's \u2013 we have an incredible chat functionality probably, Eric, you can correct me I'm wrong, 70% of our customers don't even know we have one. And then when they start using it, it gets very, very pervasive. So \u2013 but it just gives us a way to show our customers that there is a lot more to this platform they can get value out of, and that's what we're seeing. So \u2013 and it gives us from a salesperson in a contractual standpoint the ability to walk in and say, what does a better contractual relationship look like with Zoom that can be stickier and longer-term. I don't know if you want to add to that, Eric. Okay. I mean I will take the first one. Kelly, I will give you the second one on the details. I mean our number of customers did go up in the high end, but I will let you cover that. So, from a value perspective, I don't see us bringing out higher-level SKUs. What I do see us doing though is doing a much better job of describing and articulating the value proposition we bring to the customer and building business cases for the large enterprises so they can make a bigger purchase with us so we don't have to discount as much, okay. I think we have got \u2013 we are doing really great in the enterprise, but I don't think we are doing really great at really selling Hyatt at Board level, CEO level and being really smart about how we construct our business cases and value. And that's something that we are going to work to improve on, which I think will have a really big impact. So, we have got some work to do with our sales force and from a training perspective. But I \u2013 we just did a really big training exercise about two weeks ago and already started some of this, and it was received extremely well with our sales force. So, I mean what we don't want to do is be like our competition and just try to win on giving big discounts and giving away free stuff. That's not what we are about. And then Kelly, anything on the seat count? I mean the one thing I would add, and it's probably not a lot of commentary now, but we will be showcasing a lot of these customers at Zoomtopia, right. So, we will get you have a lot \u2013 if you attend any of that or have anybody attend that or you hear what's coming out of it, you will get a lot of contact center details."

And now, I will hand things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor of Relations. Tom, take it away.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Kelcey. Hello everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the first quarter of fiscal -- Q1 fiscal 2023. I\u2019m joined today by Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan and Zoom\u2019s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.com. Also, on this page you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the second quarter and full fiscal year 2023; our expectations regarding financial and business trends; impacts from macroeconomic developments and the Russia-Ukraine war, our market position, opportunities, growth strategy and business aspirations; and product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today\u2019s webinar. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Tom. Thank you everyone for joining us today. As we continue to execute on the strategic pillars I shared with you last quarter, we are grateful for the support and trust we have received from our customers and investors. Let me start with some recent news, then touch on our new product launches, and finally discuss some exciting customer wins, before handing it over to Kelly. Just last week, we closed our acquisition of Solvvy, which we believe will strengthen our capabilities around conversational AI and accelerate the adoption of our contact center product. The nature of the customer experience is undergoing a fundamental transformation, as enterprises increasingly look to engage their customers in more exceptional, personalized, and effortless ways. We recognize this shift and saw in Solvvy a team laser-focused on providing the very best conversational technology and empowering customer support leaders to deliver better experiences. We believe Solvvy\u2019s technology will broaden our contact center offering with scalable self-service and AI capabilities that truly enable fast and personalized customer resolutions, improved agent productivity, and valuable insights. We are very excited to join forces with Solvvy and help our growing number of contact center customers set new standards for customer service. A key part of our strategy is to enable more and more business workflows within our platform, and I am super excited about our recent launches of Zoom Whiteboard and Zoom IQ for Sales. Zoom Whiteboard is arming teams with the power of continuous collaboration in an easy-to-use solution that provides a virtual space to collaborate before, during, and after a meeting. And to help sales teams reach their full potential, we have launched Zoom IQ for Sales, a conversational AI solution that analyzes customer interactions to surface key insights, actions, and content from sales meetings. These new product launches encapsulate our strategy to move into adjacent workflows, both horizontally and vertically, in order to ensure our customers are getting more and more out of our platform. Now moving on to customer wins. We are happy to share that Humana, one of the nation\u2019s leading health and well-being companies, has expanded their relationship from Zoom meetings to include approximately 24,000 Zoom Phones to integrate voice and video in their communications platform. Thank you, Humana. I also want to thank Avis Budget Group, a leading global provider of mobility solutions, operating three of the most recognized brands in their industry through Avis, Budget and Zipcar, for expanding from being a Zoom Meetings and Zoom Rooms customer to being a broader UCaaS customer. They continue to stay seamlessly connected having added approximately 10,000 Zoom Phones across many of their global offices and car rental locations. And in addition to Zoom Meeting and Zoom Phone, our UCaaS solution includes a very robust persistent team Chat product that further drives collaboration in a seamless and integrated way. Our Chat product is used by a number of large enterprises, including a Fortune 10 company with over 130,000 users. I also want to thank Lumio, a preeminent leader in residential solar and home experience. Lumio is a happy Zoom Meetings customer, who recently enabled their 4,000 employees to enjoy the use of Zoom Chat. Lumio chose Zoom Chat for its ease of deployment and to enhance communication and collaboration across their team. The next two wins are very special because they demonstrate the strength of our platform offering and how the contact center is a critical component of the platform. I want to thank TeamHealth, the leading physician practice in the U.S., for their trust in Zoom. Their innovation-focused team is committed to delivering the best quality experience possible for their employees, healthcare providers, and customers. A longstanding, avid Zoom Meetings, Zoom Webinar and Zoom Rooms customer, TeamHealth recently expanded their services with thousands of Zoom Phone licenses across their organization. And their journey did not end there. Given their seamless experience across our platform, they saw potential value in adding our Zoom Contact Center to modernize internal IT support services across their tens of thousands of employees and healthcare affiliates. And last but certainly not least, I want to thank Franklin Covey, a leading provider of leadership, individual effectiveness, and business execution training and assessment services. Franklin Covey started as a Zoom Meetings and Zoom Events customer. In Q1, recognizing Zoom\u2019s expansion into the contact center and proven UCaaS capabilities, they decided to deploy Zoom Phone together with Zoom Contact Center. They saw them as going hand in hand to support many of their external call center needs in the U.S. including voice and video channels as well as skills-based routing. We look forward to continuing our journey with Franklin Covey by delivering additional capabilities as we enhance and expand our contact center offering. Thank you Humana, Avis, Lumio, TeamHealth and Franklin Covey. I am so grateful to have such a great group of customers. We hear everyday from our customers about just how much impact Zoom\u2019s unified communications platform has had on how they communicate internally and externally. Recently, we commissioned Forrester Consulting to quantify Zoom\u2019s business value and provide a framework for organizations looking to understand their unified communications investment. The study indicates that Zoom\u2019s unified communications platform could provide a 261% return on investment over three years for a composite organization in their model with a payback in just less than six months. This did not come as a surprise to us or our customers, who see and feel the value of Zoom everyday, but it does set a healthy bar for what organizations can strive to accomplish with our flexible, scalable, and growing suite of communications solutions. And as companies look to empower hybrid workforces, Zoom can drive further efficiency gains through our robust Zoom Rooms offering. And there are intangible benefits as well. A new study from Gartner found that employees with more flexibility in terms of workstyle and location felt more connected to their organization\u2019s culture. We have found this to be true at Zoom, and are working to help our customers realize similar goals by enabling productivity and belonging across their teams, whether they be in-person, remote, or hybrid. As always, let me also thank our global Zoom team, customers, partners, and investors for their great trust and support. And with that I\u2019ll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric. And hello everyone. Let me start by also extending my warm welcome to the Solvvy team. We are thrilled to have you join the Zoom family. I\u2019ll first discuss the results for Q1, and then provide our outlook for Q2 and FY23. In Q1, total revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $1.074 billion, near the high end of our guidance. The growth was primarily driven by strength in our Enterprise business, which saw a steady increase in customers as well as improved renewal rates year-over-year. We also saw ongoing success in Zoom Rooms and Zoom Phone, which reached 3 million seats during the quarter. Renewals in Online improved sequentially, but growth was impacted mainly by international headwinds, including the strengthening of the dollar and the Russia-Ukraine war. Revenue from Enterprise customers grew 31% year-over-year and represented 52% of total revenue, up from 45% in Q1 of FY22. The number of Enterprise customers grew 24% year-over-year to approximately 198,900. We expect revenue from Enterprise customers to become an increasingly higher percentage of total revenue over time. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q1 came in at 123%. This was in line with expectations as existing Enterprise customers continued to expand their investments in the Zoom platform, with growth rates beginning to normalize following the very high rates of expansion previously. We saw 46% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 2,916 customers contributing more than $100,000 dollars in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represented 24% of revenue, up from 19% in Q1 of FY22. Our Americas revenue grew 15% year-over-year. Our APAC revenue grew even faster at 20% year-over-year. The performance in Americas and APAC was partially offset by the flat year-over-year growth in EMEA. This was primarily due to continued headwinds in the online business. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we believe the Russia-Ukraine war has broadly impacted our online business in Europe, and is expected to weigh on the balance of FY23 as well. Now, turning to profitability, which was strong from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, income tax benefits from discrete activities, and undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 78.6%, an improvement from 73.9% in Q1 of last year and 78.3% last quarter. The sequential improvement was mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our increasing number of co-located data centers. Given the improvements we are seeing so far this year, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 76% to 78% for the remainder of the year which is higher than our previous view of the mid-70s. Research and development expense grew by 105% year-over-year to approximately $85 million, driven by our focus on innovation. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 7.9% from 4.3% in Q1 of last year. Our new product launches reflect our ongoing investments in expanding Zoom\u2019s platform and our commitment to delivering on our customers\u2019 evolving needs. We plan to further invest in R&D to reach our long term target of 10% to 12%. Sales and marketing expense grew by 40% year-over-year to $267 million. This represented approximately 24.9% of total revenue, up from 20% in Q1 of last year. We remain committed to investing in worldwide sales capacity, channel partners, and product marketing across the Zoom platform. G&A expense grew by 26% to $93 million or approximately 8.6% of total revenue. Non-GAAP operating income expanded to $400 million dollars, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $350 million as we are seeing the benefit of efficiencies in our cloud operations. This translates to a 37.2% non-GAAP operating margin for Q1, compared with 41.9% a year ago and 39.2% last quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.03, on approximately 307 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result is $0.15 above the high end of our guidance and $0.29 lower than Q1 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year from $1.1 billion. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $3 billion, up 44% year-over-year from $2.1 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 63% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 72% in Q1 of last year, reflecting a shift towards longer term plans. As a reminder, our seasonality of renewals is front-end loaded and tapers through the year, and therefore our collections follow the same trend. This leads deferred revenue to peak in Q1, and moderate over the rest of the year reflecting the smaller renewal base. As such, we expect Q2 deferred revenue to grow at approximately 9% to 10% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $526 million, as compared to $533 million in Q1 of last year. Free cash flow was $501 million, up from $454 million in Q1 of last year. Our margins for operating cash flow and free cash flow remain strong, at 49% and 46.7%, respectively. For the fiscal year, we would expect free cash flow margin to be roughly 3 to 5 points lower than our non-GAAP operating margin, taking into account the lower deductions for stock-based compensation caused by the recent stock volatility. The Section 174 requirement to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses could further impact our free cash flow if Congress does not defer, repeal, or otherwise modify the existing legislation. Over time, assuming a more normalized SBC environment, we would expect our free cash margin on an annual basis to track approximately at or above our non-GAAP operating margin. Last earnings we announced our billion dollar share buy-back plan. As of the end of Q1, we had purchased $132 million of stock, representing 1.2 million shares. Now, turning to our FY23 guidance. This outlook is consistent with what we are observing in the market today. Specifically, it assumes that our Enterprise business will grow substantially faster than our online business. It also assumes that our year-over-year total revenue growth rate will modestly accelerate in the fourth quarter FY23. For the second quarter of FY23, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.115 billion to $1.12 billion. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $360 million to $365 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.90 to $0.92 based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. As mentioned last quarter, due to our multi-year history of profitability, we have fully utilized our NOLs. We continue to expect our tax rate to approximate the blended U.S. federal and state rate in FY23. For the full year of FY23, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.53 billion to $4.55 billion, which would represent approximately 11% year-over-year growth. We are raising our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $1.48 billion to $1.5 billion, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 33%. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $3.70 to $3.77, based on approximately 309 million shares outstanding. Before we conclude, I\u2019d like to update you on our recently issued inaugural ESG report. The report includes information regarding our ESG initiatives and policies, environmental performance and targets, details of Zoom\u2019s and our employees\u2019 charitable contributions, diversity metrics, and an index providing standardized reporting according to the SASB framework. As always, Zoom is grateful to be a driving force enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless, and secure communications platform. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors. Kelcey, please queue up our first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Perfect. Thanks so much, guys. Congratulations on the quarter. Clearly, you guys are seeing a lot of traction on the Phone front. I just wanted to get a sense of, as you look into fiscal '23, just what you think could be other categories of kind of ancillary products that could contribute to growth and just when you would expect kind of those categories outside of core video to be more than 10% of revenue. Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, we're super excited, of course, about recently launched products, including Whiteboard and Contact Center. We saw some Contact Center deals. You heard some of those names that Eric talked about at the beginning of the call. And then, of course, Zoom Rooms continues to be a really important part of our strategy going forward, especially with, I think, the ever-evolving status of what flexible and hybrid work is going to look like in the future. In terms of when I expect any of those products, I think on a combined basis, we do see the combination of those products exceeding 10% of revenue today. We've always committed that as soon as each -- any individual product gets to 10%, of course, we'll start disclosing that. I think that's likely -- not likely to happen in FY23, but probably in FY24, FY25, you'll start to see some of those product lines coming into their own and producing at least 10% of revenue.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Matt Stotler with William Blair.\nMatt Stotler: Maybe just one on contact center for me. Obviously, good to hear some early wins there. Would love to get an update, I guess, more broadly on kind of the adoption, overall demand that you're seeing for that product, specific use cases that you're seeing customers kind of roll out for. And then as you think about the functionality road map from here, what are the most critical pieces? Obviously, nice to see Solvvy coming in. But on that side, we'd love to get your thoughts on that going forward as well.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Matt, that's a good question. First of all, very, very excited to already have several contact center paid customers, right, because their trust in the proven UCaaS capabilities. And for those customers, they already deployed Zoom Meetings and also either already deployed Zoom Phone or they are going to deploy Zoom Phone. They prefer deploying Zoom contact center as well because we already built a very scalable call routing engine \u2013already, right, and a lot of features -- core contact center features already built in. And also, we try not only just to focus on one use case like enterprise IT services. Broadly speaking, this is a much bigger opportunity for us. We keep adding more and more features, like recently acquired Solvvy composition of AI capabilities and even some noncore features like workforce management, Q&A model, like CSAT, all those features we are going to add to the Zoom contact center. We are going to become a very, very, I would say, very meaningful, [Indiscernible] contact center service provider. We're very excited. The team is working extremely hard and very excited.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Michael Funk with Bank of America.\nMichael Funk: So, along a similar line of thinking, thinking about the added capabilities, whether it's Zoom Phone or contact center, how is that changing your sales strategy in the way that -- way you interact with customers? And then, how should we think about that also affecting the sales cycle, potentially lengthening that as you add a more complex solution? Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Kelly, feel free to chime in. I think first of all, I do not think that is complex because the trusts are established. Customers always ask about our product road map. They want us to offer more value to them, right. Based on the very consistent front-end experience and seamless back-end architecture, and the cost to deploy Zoom Meetings, Zoom Chat and also deploy Zoom Phone, Zoom Rooms. Now given the contact center is no-brainer to customers. Yes, I trust your brand, I trust your capabilities and we'd like to test your contact center as well. That's the reason when we announced the Zoom Whiteboard, right, also see the early adoption. It is pretty good. Not to mention the Zoom IQ for Sales because we received a lot of feedback from customers. They trust Zoom. They want us offer more value. Look at all those use cases, starting from a sales department, support department, contact center and maybe other departments, working to add more and more value in the new services, new product innovations and features because I do not think that that will introduce any complex process sales because the trust is already established, right? It's more like an upsell. Even for new customers, when they do a revenue check with other very happy customers, I think it is -- again, this is a pretty straightforward sales process.\nKelly Steckelberg: I would just add that -- sorry. If I -- land and expand is a very tried and true sales strategy for Zoom from the very beginning. And working with our account teams, we have these experts in the overlay team that come in and continue to do land and expand. And it's working very, very well. So, I completely agree with Eric. It isn't adding complexity. It's just continuing to build our relationship with our customers, which is what we've been doing since day one.\nOperator: Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs has the next question.\nKash Rangan: Eric, I was deeply intrigued by your launch of the conversational AI product through the acquisition, albeit. Can you just give us a sense as to the product road map? How does it integrate with the Zoom platform? And relative to embedded competitors in the conversational intelligence space, what would be Zoom's competitive differentiation in the industry? It feels like at one level, you're entering the CRM market, not in the way Salesforce.com and so on and so forth. But you're getting into a level of customer engagement, which is very different than the video meeting platform. Can you tell us a little bit more about that? Thank you so much.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Great question. So, first of all, if you look at the contact center, that's a huge market, right? A lot of use cases, right? Also, by the way, a lot of enterprise customers today, they still deploy on-prem contact center solutions. In the next several years, they are going to market to the cloud. And aside of that, I think to have a customer similar to the migrated to the cloud offering, we need to make sure there are no any feature regressions, similar to what we did before to have a customer migrated [Indiscernible] right, from on-prem [indiscernible]. With that aside, a lot of features, right, it\u2019s just product cases, we have to add, right? That is one. It's more like a no-brainer. It's nothing -- that's a key differentiation, but we have to add that. That's one. Two is you look at the AI. AI is something new. You've got a lot of other contact center solution providers. They do not have AI capabilities before, right? Now this is something new, and we are doubling down on that. That is one -- I would say, the key depreciation how to move faster at a much better AI capabilities. In terms of overall key differentiation, I would say the video is a key use case right, how to further improve the interaction between the customers or IT, the support with employees and how to turn on the video, how to analyze the video conversation like a speech to text transcription, right, and recently like Zoom IQ for Sales. That is very important for us. In terms of integration with ServiceNow, with Zendesk or [indiscernible] or others, I think this is just a feature. We have a -- I do not think that's a key differentiation because every contact center solutions, they all have that, right? So, again, we think it has a huge opportunity ahead of us because customers also like the new solution, the modern solution, not like old architecture, very hard to innovate, right? Given the progress we made over the past seven years for Zoom Phone, we are going to do something similar. That's why I'm very excited.\nOperator: And moving on to Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSiti Panigrahi: I wanted to ask you about your fiscal '23 guidance. You talked about FX headwinds. Maybe could you give us some a little more color on the FX headwinds? And also the impact from Ukraine war on the EMEA side, which mostly going to impact online segment. So, how -- what should we expect in terms of growth rate or churn on the online segment versus Enterprise?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, in terms of FX, where we're seeing the impact, of course, is in the euro, the pound and the yen. And when we look at the trends that we've seen in Q1 for the combination of both, the strengthening of the dollar as well as the impact for the war, we -- it built into our guidance as an expectation that the combination of those two factors is having about a 1% impact on revenue. And that's largely -- the war is largely -- the impact of the war is largely on the online segment. We haven't really seen the impact in the Enterprise. The FX, of course, is extending across both, of the segments.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays.\nRyan MacWilliams: Another one on guidance. Kelly, just how should we think about Zoom reaching your second quarter revenue guide from a segment standpoint? Just wondering here, given some fluctuations in your online business, maybe what we can see some strength in next quarter? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, if you remember last quarter, we talked about that enterprise would be growing in 20% plus for the year and that online would be flattish. And we said that flattish, meant that it could be a little bit above zero, it could be a little bit low zero, depending on the quarter. And then the other thing we've talked about is that inflection point coming in Q4. So, you should expect that Q2 is also going to be another volatile quarter for the online segment, given all the factors we just talked about, but that we really continue to see strength in the enterprise, and that's where the growth for Q2 will be driven from. And then by the time we get to the back half of the year, that's where we're really going to start to see that stabilization of the online business.\nOperator: I'm moving on to Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: I wanted to drill into the NRR that we're seeing across the board. Appreciate all the color. But maybe can you give us a sense for how have you seen the NRR for 100,000 customers generally trending? Have you seen that hold up? Has that gone down? And maybe just help us understand usage patterns for your largest customers. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, thank you, Rishi. As a reminder, last quarter, we shifted to the new metric of net dollar expansion for our enterprise customers. This is as we're starting to split out -- sorry, Enterprise segment, I should say. So as we're starting to split out the business between Enterprise and online, as we think that's really the most appropriate way to look at the business going forward and how we're managing it internally. So that metric did -- historically, we had disclosed 130% or above, it came down to 123%, which is really right in line with what we were expecting. As you think about the overall growth rate of the Company, and as we've indicated, we expect the Enterprise segment to be growing 20% plus, the net dollar expansion should be tracking the deceleration, if you will, and it should be tracking to that as well. And that's why it's coming in right at 123%, which is just what we would expect.\nRishi Jaluria: Yes. But sorry, just to quickly follow up. If we were to think specifically at the 100,000 level, right, because I'm sure there's more churn going on in kind of the medium level versus your 6-figure customers. Without putting a number on it, how would you say that NRR for that cohort of your largest customers has trended over time, and how is it trending now?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. It's higher than the 123%. So, that's what I would say. As we really continue to see strength in both, the new bookings as well as renewals in that segment of our customer base.\nOperator: Citi's Tyler Radke has the next question.\nTyler Radke: A question on the cost side of the equation here. So, you outperformed, I think, by 400, 500 basis points this quarter on operating margins. Yet it seems like it's still a decently strong hiring quarter. Can you just talk about if you're finding more efficiencies in the business or if there's something specific this quarter. And then as I look at your gross margins, again, it sounds like you're expecting them to come down between 76 and 78. You were above that this quarter. So, just anything in terms of new capacity or call center stuff being deployed that would impact kind of that trajectory?\nKelly Steckelberg: So actually, gross margins were stronger than we expected in the quarter. And if you remember, in Q4, the way that we talked about the outlook for gross margins, even though we don't explicitly guide to them, was we talked about and expecting them to be in the mid-70s for the balance of the year. So actually, 76 to 78 for the rest of the year is higher than we were anticipating coming into the quarter. And that improvement as we really have made a lot of strides in terms of optimizing our cloud usage and getting that into the colos, thanks to our DevOps team, and that is really helping drive the improvement in the operating margins going forward. And as you said, we do continue to see strength in hiring, continuing to attract great talent, which we're really excited about, continuing to invest in R&D, which is really important for the long-term innovation and commitment to our platform.\nOperator: And our next question will come from William Power with Baird.\nWilliam Power: So, I guess, Kelly, for you, as you look at the fiscal Q2 revenue guidance, it came in a bit stronger than I think we and the Street might have been, yet the full year is still pretty consistent. Any other color just as to the puts and takes in the second half of the year? And I guess, just as part of that, just trying to understand the key drivers around your confidence of reaccelerating revenue growth in fiscal Q4. What are the key drivers to that?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, when we gave Q4 guidance, and it continues to be the case today, we continue to see strength in our enterprise business, and that's both, on new bookings as well as renewals. And then, when you think about the opportunity coming with all of these new product introductions, super excited about Zoom events, which came last year, of course, Zoom Rooms and their strength, the new contributions that are possible from Whiteboard as well as Contact Center. That's what we think is going to drive the growth continue through the rest of this year. And then online. We -- while we saw some volatility in Q1, as we've talked about at length already, and we expect to see some of that continue into Q2. By the time we get into Q3 and Q4, there's a couple of things that are happening. First of all, the team has done an amazing job with new initiatives around pricing and packaging and localized payment types, which is really driving strength across the board, especially internationally, as well as the fact that we see stabilization occurring just because of the aging of our cohorts. So, we go all the way back to last year's Analyst Day, and we showed you that chart, right, which shows how once cohorts get to that 16 months of tenure, they really start to stabilize in terms of retention rates. That has continued to hold cohort after cohort even after -- even when there's volatility earlier on. And so, by the time we get to Q3 and Q4, you start to see 75 percentage plus of our cohort in that tenure, which in and of itself drives a lot of stability in the online business, which leads to not only stabilization, but potentially growth in the back half, which is what we're modeling today.\nOperator: And we'll move on to Parker Lane with Stifel who I think might be having some difficulties with his video, so he may not appear on video today.\nMax Osnowitz: Sorry about that. It's Max Osnowitz for Parker Lane. Yes. We're in transit today, both of us. So sorry for the no video. But just thinking about the customer announcements that you made, it feels like there's a good variety of industries. Is there any industry that you're noticing that you're seeing a lot of demand from that maybe kind of lagged behind everybody else during COVID and is still going through the transition or has started to transition that others haven't?\nEric Yuan: Yes. I would say it's pretty consistent. Look at our installed base from allocation to health care, financial services. And it's pretty consistent, right? Customers would like to consolidate, not only Meetings and also the Zoom Phone, the contact center, but also more and more customers are deploying Zoom Chat solution as well, data processing [ph] and team chat works extremely well. They like that solution. That's also free. And having said that, I think I do not see like any specific vertical industry, right, kind of make a big difference like compared to other industries. And overall, it's very consistent. Look at our installed base and winning them all and they need us to deliver more value, more service to them. Take a Whiteboard, for example, right? Look at the early adopters across industries, right? It's pretty promising.\nOperator: We'll move on to Matt VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatt VanVliet: So, I guess, thinking about overall direct sales, headcount, investments that you look to be making over the next year plus, any specific SKU across various regions that you're finding you want to invest more heavily in? And then sort of alongside of that, on the channel side, how much of that is driving this pretty significant increase in Zoom Phone versus direct sales and kind of where investments are going to go around channel enablement as well?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So we are continuing to invest in our sales organization globally, but you'll see, and as a percentage of year-over-year basis, greater investment happening internationally, including channels. So, we've made huge progress in our channel investments and contribution in the U.S., but that's largely nascent, still internationally. And the team is doing a really great job of looking for not only master agents but carriers, and it depends on which works best depending on each of the regions. But that is a significant area of focus for us this year.\nOperator: And moving on to Alex Zukin with Wolf Research.\nAlex Zukin: So Kelly, maybe just for you, can you remind us what the difference is in either the operating margin or free cash flow margin profile between the online and Enterprise business? Because it looks like you massively outperformed on cash flow. At the same time, as the online business actually declined 2%. And so, I want to understand just how much reliance is there. You gave a free cash flow margin target for the full year, at least a range. How much of that is based on the performance of the online business versus the Enterprise business? And then, Eric, if I think about the stock-based comp, what's the plan for the Company? How should we think about that on a go-forward basis in terms of either repricing people's RSUs, giving more shares, just curious how you're thinking about.\nKelly Steckelberg: Eric, do you want to go first?\nEric Yuan: Yes. You can address the first one.\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay. So Alex, the impact that you've seen and the outlook we\u2019re giving from free cash flow is much greater impact from stock-based comp than from sort of any change in the balance of online versus Enterprise. So, what's happening because of the stock volatility, we've seen much fewer stock-based comp deductions as employees are choosing to hold on to their options or their RSUs at this point and not -- either not exercising or the deduction itself just isn't as great. So, that's really the significant contributor to why there's a difference that we've given from the Q1 performance to the outlook for the rest of the year.\nEric Yuan: Yes. So Alex, back to your second question. I think our company culture is deliver happiness, right? My number one priority is to make sure all Zoom is still happy, right? Together, we make a customer happy. Particularly, we had a little bit over 2,000 employees. Look at it today, almost 7,000 employees. And we hired so many employees over the past two years. Guess what? When they joined Zoom, the stock price was too high. We cannot control the price, but we can control the delivering happiness to our employees. Certainly, for all those employees who joined over the past two years, and the stock price is probably much higher than the stock price today, we did issue the new stocks for them, right? Ultimately, how to make sure those employees happy every time, every quarter, every week, we look at are there any things we can do differently to make sure our employees happy. This is always ongoing effort. That's our number one priority, as always.\nAlex Zukin: Good. And Kelly, just maybe just to ask the question. I meant in terms of the differential in terms of the margin profile of the two businesses, is there -- is one of them inherently more profitable than the other?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. The online business, as we've said before, contributes more substantially from an operating margin as well as cash flow perspective because they largely are untouched by our sales organization. So, they don't have the associated expense from a commissions perspective. They may have credit card fees associated with it, but that's a few points versus the commissions. That's the biggest difference you\u2019re going to see between those two.\nOperator: And moving on to Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: I'm wondering, have you seen any paring back or moderation of investment from some customers in light of growing macro concerns? And if so, has it varied by either geography or customer size? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: I mean, we really have it, especially in enterprise, we have continued to see strength in renewals as well as additional new customers and expansion into additional products. So, we really haven't seen that in terms of concern. I think we've heard from other people that what they're really focused on might be -- if they're limiting spending, it's focused more around potentially hiring or travel. And, of course, Zoom is a great alternative if they're focusing on limiting internal travel. And so, we really haven't seen that impact today.\nOperator: James Fish with Piper Sandler has the next question.\nJames Fish: Deferred revenue grew about 8, 9 points faster than you anticipated this quarter, but it did seem like durations extended a little bit. Are you guys incentivizing customers or the sales team to extend those durations, or is it more a factor of the product mix like Phone and Contact Center picking up, which if it's the latter and we're seeing kind of long-term RPO grow faster than current RPO, I guess, why wouldn't we see deferred revenue grow as you get more multiyear deferred revenue upfront and that helped the free cash flow margins versus the operating margins?\nKelly Steckelberg: So, our compensation structure around this or incentives for either reps or customers has not changed, James. We do have discounts in place for customers in terms of multiyear agreements, but that has been consistent over time. And we -- as we're seeing more and more of the revenue contribution coming from Enterprise, we are -- and I think as we move sort of past the COVID buying cycles, we've seen people go back to buying more and more longer-term agreements. We also have seen a lot of initiatives even online in terms of opportunities for customers to buy annual rather than monthly. And the team has done a really great job of incenting that as well. So, we are seeing kind of an overall shift across both segments of the business to longer term. The reason you could see an increase in noncurrent RPO but not necessarily deferred is because they don't always pay all of those multiyear terms upfront. They could have a three-year deal but only pay a year. Less often, they'll have a three-year deal but pay monthly. But it's not uncommon to have like a three-year deal but only pay one year in advance.\nJames Fish: Okay. So booking three years billing annually. Makes sense.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Happy birthday next week.\nJames Fish: You, too.\nOperator: Ittai Kidron with Oppenheimer has the next question.\nIttai Kidron: Hey, guys. Nice quarter. Kelly, a couple of quick ones for you. On the Phone subscriber additions, it's great to see the 3 million milestone. But if my math is right, it took you kind of 9 months to get from 2 million to 3 million. It took you 7 to get from 1 million to 2 million. So, are we seeing a deceleration in the pace of Phone additions or maybe my math is wrong here? And then, on the duration of the Enterprise contracts, it's great to see that customers are signing longer-term contracts. Could you talk about duration, how that has changed quarter-over-quarter? And how do I think about the discounting that comes the longer duration contracts in market?\nKelly Steckelberg: So, first of all, around Zoom Phone, we actually said we achieved 3 million during the quarter, not at the end of the quarter. So, we are sitting above 3 million, and we're at the end of the quarter. So, I don't think -- you actually can't do the exact calc based on the information we've given. And so, I wouldn't assume there's a deceleration in that rate. And then, in terms of the longer-term contracts, it's a little bit of what I was just discussing with James, is that I think people -- customers as they move past the pandemic and really thinking about how they're going to support their employees in this post-pandemic, flexible, hybrid work, they're committing to our platform, and they're committing to it in a longer term, especially as they're bringing on multiproduct and seeing the efficiency that they get, it makes sense for them. Our structure around that has not changed. So, we do, as we always have, offer discounts for size of deal, multiproduct, multiyear, willingness to pay upfront, but that hasn't changed. It's just as customers continue to see the value of Zoom and committing to that for a longer term.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Ittai, just quickly on the main hand, we've got to look at a number of the seats that previously sold. On the other hand, also do not forget the quality of service, right? We kind of deliver a platform to make workforce happy. Let's say you target some other cloud-based service providers. You talk to their customers and talk with our customers. And as you know, we make a customer happy. Enterprise is not only for all those on-prem, the Phone service customers, right, microphone on-prem and the cloud, but also some other cloud-based, the customer also migrate some other cloud-based from services to Zoom platform as well. It further proves we deliver a better experience, make a customer feel happy. That's our momentum, so.\nOperator: Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities will move on to the next question.\nShebly Seyrafi: So, with your guidance for deferred revenue growth of like 9% to 10% in Q2, it looks like your -- with your revenue guidance, you're getting to be slightly negative on a billings basis in Q2. So, my first question is, do you think that's the low watermark in terms of billings growth this year? And then secondly, related to that, do you think that the deferred revenue growth can accelerate meaningfully in the back half, especially with the easy compares in the back half for deferred?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So, remember that our renewals are front-end loaded. This goes all the way back to early in the pandemic when we had that large inflow of bookings in Q1 and that it's Q1 is still the high point for renewals and that that declines through the year. And so, based on that, our collections and our deferred, it's not 1 to 1, but they largely follow that similar trend because you have this large inflow of deferred revenue in Q1 but then is getting amortized throughout the year. And then the renewals, as their lesser each period, are not at the same rate to necessarily reveal what's being amortized over the year. So that's why we have that trend, and you won't necessarily -- I mean it's going to change over time as we start moving to more and more of our new bookings to a normalized seasonality of back half of the year, but that is going to take some time given just the large amount of bookings we saw a few years ago in Q1. And then, in terms of Q2 being the low watermark, that -- it could be even lower in Q3 as we're still continuing through that renewal cycle that I just described.\nShebly Seyrafi: And that's a billing statement or revenue...\nKelly Steckelberg: Billings. I'm sorry, yes, billings.\nShebly Seyrafi: In Q3.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nOperator: Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities. Please go ahead with your question.\nPatrick Walravens: Hi. [Indiscernible] on for Pat.\nKelly Steckelberg: [Indiscernible] Patrick, how you've changed.\nUnidentified Analyst: Given the layoffs, hiring freezes and hiring slowdowns we're seeing throughout tech sector, can you give an update about what you're seeing on the hiring front and your hiring approach, any changes you've had?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. We are -- we had a very strong hiring quarter in Q1. We continue to attract great talent. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are still continuing to invest in innovation. So, very focused on hiring in R&D as we continue to build on our platform and produce new products and then also very committed to continuing to hire in sales and marketing as we continue to expand our sales capacity on a global basis and focus on product marketing also on a global basis. So, while we are always focused on being as efficient as we can around G&A and COGS, we are continuing to invest there as well at the levels that we need to continue to support the expansion of the business.\nEric Yuan: Just quickly, Patrick, if you look at the revenue in the base, plus it's extremely positive in terms of cash flow, right? So, why not double down on R&D, new product and accounting executive, right? I think we're more flexible, much better positioned, right, given this sort of a greater resignation, economic downturn. And yes, that's why we're very excited about the future, more innovative services and more efficient.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Ryan Koontz with Needham.\nRyan Koontz: I wanted to ask a little, Eric, about your contact center strategy a little more. Was Solvvy existing partner that you worked with previous to the deal? And do you envision Solvvy being a standalone play where you can use that to augment existing other contact centers, or how do you envision kind of Solvvy -- where is it going to roll into the Zoom platform and be a holistic offer?\nEric Yuan: Yes. First of all, we are very excited about the Solvvy acquisition. This is a great team, laser-focused on conversational AI with talent and technology. First of all, we are going to embed that into our overall contact center offering. That's number one for sure. In terms of if we needed to also keep making that product as a stand-alone product, keep adopting on that and sell that service and the stand-alone service, and in the next few weeks, a few months, we are going to discuss that. But overall, we've got to look at the bigger picture, right? Customer, they need a full-blown great contact center experience from Zoom, right? And the Solvvy product will be part of that. And many customers already told us very excited about this acquisition.\nOperator: You will now hear from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: Kelly, you mentioned the outlook calls for a modest reacceleration of growth in fiscal Q4. Thinking through the drivers and assumptions there just beyond compares, is there anything you can add to help us think through how much of that comes from some of the online headwinds rolling off of the model, the seasonal profile of Enterprise coming through as we get closer to the exit of the year or just other pieces to be mindful of? And on the EMEA impacts and the flattish growth that you're seeing there in Q1, anything you can add just around if that changes -- if that's a change in terms of the fiscal year outlook and how much of that could be incremental versus the targets and what you're seeing when you frame the outlook in 4Q for us? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Sure. So the acceleration in Q4 is coming from both, online and Enterprise. So, online is due to the great initiatives that they're working on in terms of pricing and packaging and payment types and local payment currencies as well as just the aging of the cohorts. So, they just get a lot more stable as they age past that 16-month term, if you will. And what we're seeing is by the time we get to Q4, we're going to have 75ish percent of our online cohorts that have aged to that level. So that really brings a lot of stability to the online segment and to return it to not only being stable, but also growing. And so, that's really exciting. And then, the Enterprise, we continue to expect growth to expand due to just expanded sales capacities Eric just talked about, continuing to invest in AEs, investing in our international channel as well as contribution from all these amazing new products that are continuing to grow and find their sea legs, if you will, and will really contribute we get to the back half of the year, including Whiteboard, Contact Center, Events, all of those things that we'll start to see more and more contribution from those. And then -- EMEA. So incremental EMEA, that is really, I think, difficult to predict right now given the state of what's happening in EMEA. As I talked about the impact from FX as well as the war is approximately 1% of revenue and counted in our current outlook and guidance that we've given. So, if things in any way were to improve dramatically sooner than that, there could be upside, but I think we're all in a wait-and-see mode there.\nOperator: Moving on to Peter Levine with Evercore.\nPeter Levine: So maybe to follow up on the -- I think the prior land and expand question with -- you have Phone, Contact Center, core meetings, it'd seem like there are a number of different buyers across the board that you have to go after, right, to get a market share. So for one, on the Enterprise side, I'm assuming you're seeing sales cycles, if you're selling [Technical Difficulty] contact center, package is taking longer for [Technical Difficulty] approvals, but really asking, like, how should we think about sales and marketing leverage and [Technical Difficulty] return? Like how do you synchronize your go-to-market kind of leverage now that you have the platform and [Technical Difficulty]?\nKelly Steckelberg: Eric, do you want to talk about that? Do you want me to?\nEric Yuan: Sure, absolutely. So, to talk about go-to-market strategy, right, similar to what we did before, I think it worked extremely well, so -- and to build a trust to with customer, right? And given that we have so many very happy customers over the past two years, we truly have the word, happy people stay connected. For any new services, they are very happy to try to test the services, right? Because of that, our sales -- opportunity is huge, right? And we're already stable to trust. Customers are really not like just looking for other solutions, just the work, they really need to have some solution that can truly make an employee for workforce happy, right? Having said that, Zoom IQ for Sales, right, after we launched that, we already have several paid customers. Reason why the customers trust our brand and doing the upsell, the period, right? We always talk to the customer, hey, we have this service, we have that service, right? And overall, I think if trust already is there, any new and upsell opportunity should be relatively easier even if the buyer is different because the CIO, they only made a decision, right, to standardize [ph] Zoom Meetings, the Phone, the Contact Centers, you might give for -- Whiteboard. And also, by the way, do not forget about awesome position to Chat solution as well, right? And that's the reason why customers look at the full usage stack. Zoom has everything, right? That is the key. That's why customers trust us. By the way, we've built everything by ourselves. Very consistent fund and experience, very respectable [ph] backend and also very efficient architecture as well. That's why we are very optimistic about our go-to-market strategy. In terms of marketing, for sure, we do not need to spend so much money to promote Zoom brand, right? Zoom already became a word, right? How to make sure folks on -- it looks like vertical market, right, some in-person events and also the -- stay as close as possible with the prospect and the customers, and that's our focus, right? Not like previously, we really focused on the brand, the marketing. That's not our focus, more of the enterprise market now.\nOperator: And we have time for one additional question, which will come from Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark.\nMatthew Harrigan: Can you talk about how the advent of private 5G networks, especially relative to the limitations of Wi-Fi on the security side, really helped the Enterprise opportunity over a period of time, both as far as the TAM and the specific alternatives that you offer for that?\nEric Yuan: Matthew, first of all, thank you for waiting for such a long time. I think look at Wi-Fi or corporate LAN network or 5G, actually, from our perspective, as long as any technology kind of help improve customers' connectivity, making the connection stable, we are very happy, right, especially between 4G and 5G. 5G is great, but not in every country already deployed 5G. And also look at our optimization technology, right? And [Technical Difficulty] and stable network, even 5G. And we also optimize more if needed. Overall, I think anything from infrastructure related can help improve customer with collaboration experience, we are all for it. That's why we cannot have a 5G or 6G. I think that we just make sure we build an application, leverage those advanced infrastructure to truly deliver happiness to our customers.\nOperator: And again, this does conclude our Q&A session for today. So, Eric, I'll turn things back to you for any closing or additional comments.\nEric Yuan: Well, thank you all. Really appreciate. Again, thank you for every Zoom's hard work. Thank you for every customer, partner, investors. We are very, very -- we truly appreciate it. Thank you again. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Bye, everybody. Thank you.\nOperator: And again everyone that does conclude today's earnings release. We thank you all so much for your participation. Enjoy the rest of your day, and we'll see you next quarter.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric. And hello everyone. Let me start by also extending my warm welcome to the Solvvy team. We are thrilled to have you join the Zoom family. I'll first discuss the results for Q1, and then provide our outlook for Q2 and FY23. In Q1, total revenue grew 12% year-over-year to $1.074 billion, near the high end of our guidance. The growth was primarily driven by strength in our Enterprise business, which saw a steady increase in customers as well as improved renewal rates year-over-year. We also saw ongoing success in Zoom Rooms and Zoom Phone, which reached 3 million seats during the quarter. Renewals in Online improved sequentially, but growth was impacted mainly by international headwinds, including the strengthening of the dollar and the Russia-Ukraine war. Revenue from Enterprise customers grew 31% year-over-year and represented 52% of total revenue, up from 45% in Q1 of FY22. The number of Enterprise customers grew 24% year-over-year to approximately 198,900. We expect revenue from Enterprise customers to become an increasingly higher percentage of total revenue over time. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q1 came in at 123%. This was in line with expectations as existing Enterprise customers continued to expand their investments in the Zoom platform, with growth rates beginning to normalize following the very high rates of expansion previously. We saw 46% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 2,916 customers contributing more than $100,000 dollars in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represented 24% of revenue, up from 19% in Q1 of FY22. Our Americas revenue grew 15% year-over-year. Our APAC revenue grew even faster at 20% year-over-year. The performance in Americas and APAC was partially offset by the flat year-over-year growth in EMEA. This was primarily due to continued headwinds in the online business. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we believe the Russia-Ukraine war has broadly impacted our online business in Europe, and is expected to weigh on the balance of FY23 as well. Now, turning to profitability, which was strong from both GAAP and non-GAAP perspectives. I will focus on our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, income tax benefits from discrete activities, and undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 78.6%, an improvement from 73.9% in Q1 of last year and 78.3% last quarter. The sequential improvement was mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our increasing number of co-located data centers. Given the improvements we are seeing so far this year, we expect gross margins to be in the range of 76% to 78% for the remainder of the year which is higher than our previous view of the mid-70s. Research and development expense grew by 105% year-over-year to approximately $85 million, driven by our focus on innovation. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 7.9% from 4.3% in Q1 of last year. Our new product launches reflect our ongoing investments in expanding Zoom's platform and our commitment to delivering on our customers' evolving needs. We plan to further invest in R&D to reach our long term target of 10% to 12%. Sales and marketing expense grew by 40% year-over-year to $267 million. This represented approximately 24.9% of total revenue, up from 20% in Q1 of last year. We remain committed to investing in worldwide sales capacity, channel partners, and product marketing across the Zoom platform. G&A expense grew by 26% to $93 million or approximately 8.6% of total revenue. Non-GAAP operating income expanded to $400 million dollars, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $350 million as we are seeing the benefit of efficiencies in our cloud operations. This translates to a 37.2% non-GAAP operating margin for Q1, compared with 41.9% a year ago and 39.2% last quarter. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.03, on approximately 307 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result is $0.15 above the high end of our guidance and $0.29 lower than Q1 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.3 billion, up 22% year-over-year from $1.1 billion. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $3 billion, up 44% year-over-year from $2.1 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 63% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 72% in Q1 of last year, reflecting a shift towards longer term plans. As a reminder, our seasonality of renewals is front-end loaded and tapers through the year, and therefore our collections follow the same trend. This leads deferred revenue to peak in Q1, and moderate over the rest of the year reflecting the smaller renewal base. As such, we expect Q2 deferred revenue to grow at approximately 9% to 10% year-over-year. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $526 million, as compared to $533 million in Q1 of last year. Free cash flow was $501 million, up from $454 million in Q1 of last year. Our margins for operating cash flow and free cash flow remain strong, at 49% and 46.7%, respectively. For the fiscal year, we would expect free cash flow margin to be roughly 3 to 5 points lower than our non-GAAP operating margin, taking into account the lower deductions for stock-based compensation caused by the recent stock volatility. The Section 174 requirement to capitalize and amortize R&D expenses could further impact our free cash flow if Congress does not defer, repeal, or otherwise modify the existing legislation. Over time, assuming a more normalized SBC environment, we would expect our free cash margin on an annual basis to track approximately at or above our non-GAAP operating margin. Last earnings we announced our billion dollar share buy-back plan. As of the end of Q1, we had purchased $132 million of stock, representing 1.2 million shares. Now, turning to our FY23 guidance. This outlook is consistent with what we are observing in the market today. Specifically, it assumes that our Enterprise business will grow substantially faster than our online business. It also assumes that our year-over-year total revenue growth rate will modestly accelerate in the fourth quarter FY23. For the second quarter of FY23, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.115 billion to $1.12 billion. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $360 million to $365 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.90 to $0.92 based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. As mentioned last quarter, due to our multi-year history of profitability, we have fully utilized our NOLs. We continue to expect our tax rate to approximate the blended U.S. federal and state rate in FY23. For the full year of FY23, we expect revenue to be in the range of $4.53 billion to $4.55 billion, which would represent approximately 11% year-over-year growth. We are raising our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of approximately $1.48 billion to $1.5 billion, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 33%. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $3.70 to $3.77, based on approximately 309 million shares outstanding. Before we conclude, I'd like to update you on our recently issued inaugural ESG report. The report includes information regarding our ESG initiatives and policies, environmental performance and targets, details of Zoom's and our employees' charitable contributions, diversity metrics, and an index providing standardized reporting according to the SASB framework. As always, Zoom is grateful to be a driving force enabling connection and collaboration worldwide with our high-quality, frictionless, and secure communications platform. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors. Kelcey, please queue up our first question. So, we're super excited, of course, about recently launched products, including Whiteboard and Contact Center. We saw some Contact Center deals. You heard some of those names that Eric talked about at the beginning of the call. And then, of course, Zoom Rooms continues to be a really important part of our strategy going forward, especially with, I think, the ever-evolving status of what flexible and hybrid work is going to look like in the future. In terms of when I expect any of those products, I think on a combined basis, we do see the combination of those products exceeding 10% of revenue today. We've always committed that as soon as each -- any individual product gets to 10%, of course, we'll start disclosing that. I think that's likely -- not likely to happen in FY23, but probably in FY24, FY25, you'll start to see some of those product lines coming into their own and producing at least 10% of revenue. I would just add that -- sorry. If I -- land and expand is a very tried and true sales strategy for Zoom from the very beginning. And working with our account teams, we have these experts in the overlay team that come in and continue to do land and expand. And it's working very, very well. So, I completely agree with Eric. It isn't adding complexity. It's just continuing to build our relationship with our customers, which is what we've been doing since day one. Yes. So, in terms of FX, where we're seeing the impact, of course, is in the euro, the pound and the yen. And when we look at the trends that we've seen in Q1 for the combination of both, the strengthening of the dollar as well as the impact for the war, we -- it built into our guidance as an expectation that the combination of those two factors is having about a 1% impact on revenue. And that's largely -- the war is largely -- the impact of the war is largely on the online segment. We haven't really seen the impact in the Enterprise. The FX, of course, is extending across both, of the segments. Yes. So, if you remember last quarter, we talked about that enterprise would be growing in 20% plus for the year and that online would be flattish. And we said that flattish, meant that it could be a little bit above zero, it could be a little bit low zero, depending on the quarter. And then the other thing we've talked about is that inflection point coming in Q4. So, you should expect that Q2 is also going to be another volatile quarter for the online segment, given all the factors we just talked about, but that we really continue to see strength in the enterprise, and that's where the growth for Q2 will be driven from. And then by the time we get to the back half of the year, that's where we're really going to start to see that stabilization of the online business. So, thank you, Rishi. As a reminder, last quarter, we shifted to the new metric of net dollar expansion for our enterprise customers. This is as we're starting to split out -- sorry, Enterprise segment, I should say. So as we're starting to split out the business between Enterprise and online, as we think that's really the most appropriate way to look at the business going forward and how we're managing it internally. So that metric did -- historically, we had disclosed 130% or above, it came down to 123%, which is really right in line with what we were expecting. As you think about the overall growth rate of the Company, and as we've indicated, we expect the Enterprise segment to be growing 20% plus, the net dollar expansion should be tracking the deceleration, if you will, and it should be tracking to that as well. And that's why it's coming in right at 123%, which is just what we would expect. Yes. It's higher than the 123%. So, that's what I would say. As we really continue to see strength in both, the new bookings as well as renewals in that segment of our customer base. So actually, gross margins were stronger than we expected in the quarter. And if you remember, in Q4, the way that we talked about the outlook for gross margins, even though we don't explicitly guide to them, was we talked about and expecting them to be in the mid-70s for the balance of the year. So actually, 76 to 78 for the rest of the year is higher than we were anticipating coming into the quarter. And that improvement as we really have made a lot of strides in terms of optimizing our cloud usage and getting that into the colos, thanks to our DevOps team, and that is really helping drive the improvement in the operating margins going forward. And as you said, we do continue to see strength in hiring, continuing to attract great talent, which we're really excited about, continuing to invest in R&D, which is really important for the long-term innovation and commitment to our platform. Yes. So, when we gave Q4 guidance, and it continues to be the case today, we continue to see strength in our enterprise business, and that's both, on new bookings as well as renewals. And then, when you think about the opportunity coming with all of these new product introductions, super excited about Zoom events, which came last year, of course, Zoom Rooms and their strength, the new contributions that are possible from Whiteboard as well as Contact Center. That's what we think is going to drive the growth continue through the rest of this year. And then online. We -- while we saw some volatility in Q1, as we've talked about at length already, and we expect to see some of that continue into Q2. By the time we get into Q3 and Q4, there's a couple of things that are happening. First of all, the team has done an amazing job with new initiatives around pricing and packaging and localized payment types, which is really driving strength across the board, especially internationally, as well as the fact that we see stabilization occurring just because of the aging of our cohorts. So, we go all the way back to last year's Analyst Day, and we showed you that chart, right, which shows how once cohorts get to that 16 months of tenure, they really start to stabilize in terms of retention rates. That has continued to hold cohort after cohort even after -- even when there's volatility earlier on. And so, by the time we get to Q3 and Q4, you start to see 75 percentage plus of our cohort in that tenure, which in and of itself drives a lot of stability in the online business, which leads to not only stabilization, but potentially growth in the back half, which is what we're modeling today. Yes. So we are continuing to invest in our sales organization globally, but you'll see, and as a percentage of year-over-year basis, greater investment happening internationally, including channels. So, we've made huge progress in our channel investments and contribution in the U.S., but that's largely nascent, still internationally. And the team is doing a really great job of looking for not only master agents but carriers, and it depends on which works best depending on each of the regions. But that is a significant area of focus for us this year. Eric, do you want to go first? Okay. So Alex, the impact that you've seen and the outlook we're giving from free cash flow is much greater impact from stock-based comp than from sort of any change in the balance of online versus Enterprise. So, what's happening because of the stock volatility, we've seen much fewer stock-based comp deductions as employees are choosing to hold on to their options or their RSUs at this point and not -- either not exercising or the deduction itself just isn't as great. So, that's really the significant contributor to why there's a difference that we've given from the Q1 performance to the outlook for the rest of the year. Yes. The online business, as we've said before, contributes more substantially from an operating margin as well as cash flow perspective because they largely are untouched by our sales organization. So, they don't have the associated expense from a commissions perspective. They may have credit card fees associated with it, but that's a few points versus the commissions. That's the biggest difference you're going to see between those two. I mean, we really have it, especially in enterprise, we have continued to see strength in renewals as well as additional new customers and expansion into additional products. So, we really haven't seen that in terms of concern. I think we've heard from other people that what they're really focused on might be -- if they're limiting spending, it's focused more around potentially hiring or travel. And, of course, Zoom is a great alternative if they're focusing on limiting internal travel. And so, we really haven't seen that impact today. So, our compensation structure around this or incentives for either reps or customers has not changed, James. We do have discounts in place for customers in terms of multiyear agreements, but that has been consistent over time. And we -- as we're seeing more and more of the revenue contribution coming from Enterprise, we are -- and I think as we move sort of past the COVID buying cycles, we've seen people go back to buying more and more longer-term agreements. We also have seen a lot of initiatives even online in terms of opportunities for customers to buy annual rather than monthly. And the team has done a really great job of incenting that as well. So, we are seeing kind of an overall shift across both segments of the business to longer term. The reason you could see an increase in noncurrent RPO but not necessarily deferred is because they don't always pay all of those multiyear terms upfront. They could have a three-year deal but only pay a year. Less often, they'll have a three-year deal but pay monthly. But it's not uncommon to have like a three-year deal but only pay one year in advance. Yes. Happy birthday next week. So, first of all, around Zoom Phone, we actually said we achieved 3 million during the quarter, not at the end of the quarter. So, we are sitting above 3 million, and we're at the end of the quarter. So, I don't think -- you actually can't do the exact calc based on the information we've given. And so, I wouldn't assume there's a deceleration in that rate. And then, in terms of the longer-term contracts, it's a little bit of what I was just discussing with James, is that I think people -- customers as they move past the pandemic and really thinking about how they're going to support their employees in this post-pandemic, flexible, hybrid work, they're committing to our platform, and they're committing to it in a longer term, especially as they're bringing on multiproduct and seeing the efficiency that they get, it makes sense for them. Our structure around that has not changed. So, we do, as we always have, offer discounts for size of deal, multiproduct, multiyear, willingness to pay upfront, but that hasn't changed. It's just as customers continue to see the value of Zoom and committing to that for a longer term. Yes. So, remember that our renewals are front-end loaded. This goes all the way back to early in the pandemic when we had that large inflow of bookings in Q1 and that it's Q1 is still the high point for renewals and that that declines through the year. And so, based on that, our collections and our deferred, it's not 1 to 1, but they largely follow that similar trend because you have this large inflow of deferred revenue in Q1 but then is getting amortized throughout the year. And then the renewals, as their lesser each period, are not at the same rate to necessarily reveal what's being amortized over the year. So that's why we have that trend, and you won't necessarily -- I mean it's going to change over time as we start moving to more and more of our new bookings to a normalized seasonality of back half of the year, but that is going to take some time given just the large amount of bookings we saw a few years ago in Q1. And then, in terms of Q2 being the low watermark, that -- it could be even lower in Q3 as we're still continuing through that renewal cycle that I just described. Billings. I'm sorry, yes, billings. Yes. [Indiscernible] Patrick, how you've changed. Yes. We are -- we had a very strong hiring quarter in Q1. We continue to attract great talent. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we are still continuing to invest in innovation. So, very focused on hiring in R&D as we continue to build on our platform and produce new products and then also very committed to continuing to hire in sales and marketing as we continue to expand our sales capacity on a global basis and focus on product marketing also on a global basis. So, while we are always focused on being as efficient as we can around G&A and COGS, we are continuing to invest there as well at the levels that we need to continue to support the expansion of the business. Sure. So the acceleration in Q4 is coming from both, online and Enterprise. So, online is due to the great initiatives that they're working on in terms of pricing and packaging and payment types and local payment currencies as well as just the aging of the cohorts. So, they just get a lot more stable as they age past that 16-month term, if you will. And what we're seeing is by the time we get to Q4, we're going to have 75ish percent of our online cohorts that have aged to that level. So that really brings a lot of stability to the online segment and to return it to not only being stable, but also growing. And so, that's really exciting. And then, the Enterprise, we continue to expect growth to expand due to just expanded sales capacities Eric just talked about, continuing to invest in AEs, investing in our international channel as well as contribution from all these amazing new products that are continuing to grow and find their sea legs, if you will, and will really contribute we get to the back half of the year, including Whiteboard, Contact Center, Events, all of those things that we'll start to see more and more contribution from those. And then -- EMEA. So incremental EMEA, that is really, I think, difficult to predict right now given the state of what's happening in EMEA. As I talked about the impact from FX as well as the war is approximately 1% of revenue and counted in our current outlook and guidance that we've given. So, if things in any way were to improve dramatically sooner than that, there could be upside, but I think we're all in a wait-and-see mode there. Eric, do you want to talk about that? Do you want me to? Bye, everybody. Thank you."

            "name": "Eric Yuan",
            "content": "Thank you, Tom. Thank you everyone for joining us today. As we continue to execute on the strategic pillars I shared with you last quarter, we are grateful for the support and trust we have received from our customers and investors. Let me start with some recent news, then touch on our new product launches, and finally discuss some exciting customer wins, before handing it over to Kelly. Just last week, we closed our acquisition of Solvvy, which we believe will strengthen our capabilities around conversational AI and accelerate the adoption of our contact center product. The nature of the customer experience is undergoing a fundamental transformation, as enterprises increasingly look to engage their customers in more exceptional, personalized, and effortless ways. We recognize this shift and saw in Solvvy a team laser-focused on providing the very best conversational technology and empowering customer support leaders to deliver better experiences. We believe Solvvy's technology will broaden our contact center offering with scalable self-service and AI capabilities that truly enable fast and personalized customer resolutions, improved agent productivity, and valuable insights. We are very excited to join forces with Solvvy and help our growing number of contact center customers set new standards for customer service. A key part of our strategy is to enable more and more business workflows within our platform, and I am super excited about our recent launches of Zoom Whiteboard and Zoom IQ for Sales. Zoom Whiteboard is arming teams with the power of continuous collaboration in an easy-to-use solution that provides a virtual space to collaborate before, during, and after a meeting. And to help sales teams reach their full potential, we have launched Zoom IQ for Sales, a conversational AI solution that analyzes customer interactions to surface key insights, actions, and content from sales meetings. These new product launches encapsulate our strategy to move into adjacent workflows, both horizontally and vertically, in order to ensure our customers are getting more and more out of our platform. Now moving on to customer wins. We are happy to share that Humana, one of the nation's leading health and well-being companies, has expanded their relationship from Zoom meetings to include approximately 24,000 Zoom Phones to integrate voice and video in their communications platform. Thank you, Humana. I also want to thank Avis Budget Group, a leading global provider of mobility solutions, operating three of the most recognized brands in their industry through Avis, Budget and Zipcar, for expanding from being a Zoom Meetings and Zoom Rooms customer to being a broader UCaaS customer. They continue to stay seamlessly connected having added approximately 10,000 Zoom Phones across many of their global offices and car rental locations. And in addition to Zoom Meeting and Zoom Phone, our UCaaS solution includes a very robust persistent team Chat product that further drives collaboration in a seamless and integrated way. Our Chat product is used by a number of large enterprises, including a Fortune 10 company with over 130,000 users. I also want to thank Lumio, a preeminent leader in residential solar and home experience. Lumio is a happy Zoom Meetings customer, who recently enabled their 4,000 employees to enjoy the use of Zoom Chat. Lumio chose Zoom Chat for its ease of deployment and to enhance communication and collaboration across their team. The next two wins are very special because they demonstrate the strength of our platform offering and how the contact center is a critical component of the platform. I want to thank TeamHealth, the leading physician practice in the U.S., for their trust in Zoom. Their innovation-focused team is committed to delivering the best quality experience possible for their employees, healthcare providers, and customers. A longstanding, avid Zoom Meetings, Zoom Webinar and Zoom Rooms customer, TeamHealth recently expanded their services with thousands of Zoom Phone licenses across their organization. And their journey did not end there. Given their seamless experience across our platform, they saw potential value in adding our Zoom Contact Center to modernize internal IT support services across their tens of thousands of employees and healthcare affiliates. And last but certainly not least, I want to thank Franklin Covey, a leading provider of leadership, individual effectiveness, and business execution training and assessment services. Franklin Covey started as a Zoom Meetings and Zoom Events customer. In Q1, recognizing Zoom's expansion into the contact center and proven UCaaS capabilities, they decided to deploy Zoom Phone together with Zoom Contact Center. They saw them as going hand in hand to support many of their external call center needs in the U.S. including voice and video channels as well as skills-based routing. We look forward to continuing our journey with Franklin Covey by delivering additional capabilities as we enhance and expand our contact center offering. Thank you Humana, Avis, Lumio, TeamHealth and Franklin Covey. I am so grateful to have such a great group of customers. We hear everyday from our customers about just how much impact Zoom's unified communications platform has had on how they communicate internally and externally. Recently, we commissioned Forrester Consulting to quantify Zoom's business value and provide a framework for organizations looking to understand their unified communications investment. The study indicates that Zoom's unified communications platform could provide a 261% return on investment over three years for a composite organization in their model with a payback in just less than six months. This did not come as a surprise to us or our customers, who see and feel the value of Zoom everyday, but it does set a healthy bar for what organizations can strive to accomplish with our flexible, scalable, and growing suite of communications solutions. And as companies look to empower hybrid workforces, Zoom can drive further efficiency gains through our robust Zoom Rooms offering. And there are intangible benefits as well. A new study from Gartner found that employees with more flexibility in terms of workstyle and location felt more connected to their organization's culture. We have found this to be true at Zoom, and are working to help our customers realize similar goals by enabling productivity and belonging across their teams, whether they be in-person, remote, or hybrid. As always, let me also thank our global Zoom team, customers, partners, and investors for their great trust and support. And with that I'll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you. Yes. Matt, that's a good question. First of all, very, very excited to already have several contact center paid customers, right, because their trust in the proven UCaaS capabilities. And for those customers, they already deployed Zoom Meetings and also either already deployed Zoom Phone or they are going to deploy Zoom Phone. They prefer deploying Zoom contact center as well because we already built a very scalable call routing engine \u2013already, right, and a lot of features -- core contact center features already built in. And also, we try not only just to focus on one use case like enterprise IT services. Broadly speaking, this is a much bigger opportunity for us. We keep adding more and more features, like recently acquired Solvvy composition of AI capabilities and even some noncore features like workforce management, Q&A model, like CSAT, all those features we are going to add to the Zoom contact center. We are going to become a very, very, I would say, very meaningful, [Indiscernible] contact center service provider. We're very excited. The team is working extremely hard and very excited. Yes. Kelly, feel free to chime in. I think first of all, I do not think that is complex because the trusts are established. Customers always ask about our product road map. They want us to offer more value to them, right. Based on the very consistent front-end experience and seamless back-end architecture, and the cost to deploy Zoom Meetings, Zoom Chat and also deploy Zoom Phone, Zoom Rooms. Now given the contact center is no-brainer to customers. Yes, I trust your brand, I trust your capabilities and we'd like to test your contact center as well. That's the reason when we announced the Zoom Whiteboard, right, also see the early adoption. It is pretty good. Not to mention the Zoom IQ for Sales because we received a lot of feedback from customers. They trust Zoom. They want us offer more value. Look at all those use cases, starting from a sales department, support department, contact center and maybe other departments, working to add more and more value in the new services, new product innovations and features because I do not think that that will introduce any complex process sales because the trust is already established, right? It's more like an upsell. Even for new customers, when they do a revenue check with other very happy customers, I think it is -- again, this is a pretty straightforward sales process. Yes. Great question. So, first of all, if you look at the contact center, that's a huge market, right? A lot of use cases, right? Also, by the way, a lot of enterprise customers today, they still deploy on-prem contact center solutions. In the next several years, they are going to market to the cloud. And aside of that, I think to have a customer similar to the migrated to the cloud offering, we need to make sure there are no any feature regressions, similar to what we did before to have a customer migrated [Indiscernible] right, from on-prem [indiscernible]. With that aside, a lot of features, right, it's just product cases, we have to add, right? That is one. It's more like a no-brainer. It's nothing -- that's a key differentiation, but we have to add that. That's one. Two is you look at the AI. AI is something new. You've got a lot of other contact center solution providers. They do not have AI capabilities before, right? Now this is something new, and we are doubling down on that. That is one -- I would say, the key depreciation how to move faster at a much better AI capabilities. In terms of overall key differentiation, I would say the video is a key use case right, how to further improve the interaction between the customers or IT, the support with employees and how to turn on the video, how to analyze the video conversation like a speech to text transcription, right, and recently like Zoom IQ for Sales. That is very important for us. In terms of integration with ServiceNow, with Zendesk or [indiscernible] or others, I think this is just a feature. We have a -- I do not think that's a key differentiation because every contact center solutions, they all have that, right? So, again, we think it has a huge opportunity ahead of us because customers also like the new solution, the modern solution, not like old architecture, very hard to innovate, right? Given the progress we made over the past seven years for Zoom Phone, we are going to do something similar. That's why I'm very excited. Yes. I would say it's pretty consistent. Look at our installed base from allocation to health care, financial services. And it's pretty consistent, right? Customers would like to consolidate, not only Meetings and also the Zoom Phone, the contact center, but also more and more customers are deploying Zoom Chat solution as well, data processing [ph] and team chat works extremely well. They like that solution. That's also free. And having said that, I think I do not see like any specific vertical industry, right, kind of make a big difference like compared to other industries. And overall, it's very consistent. Look at our installed base and winning them all and they need us to deliver more value, more service to them. Take a Whiteboard, for example, right? Look at the early adopters across industries, right? It's pretty promising. Yes. You can address the first one. Yes. So Alex, back to your second question. I think our company culture is deliver happiness, right? My number one priority is to make sure all Zoom is still happy, right? Together, we make a customer happy. Particularly, we had a little bit over 2,000 employees. Look at it today, almost 7,000 employees. And we hired so many employees over the past two years. Guess what? When they joined Zoom, the stock price was too high. We cannot control the price, but we can control the delivering happiness to our employees. Certainly, for all those employees who joined over the past two years, and the stock price is probably much higher than the stock price today, we did issue the new stocks for them, right? Ultimately, how to make sure those employees happy every time, every quarter, every week, we look at are there any things we can do differently to make sure our employees happy. This is always ongoing effort. That's our number one priority, as always. Yes. Ittai, just quickly on the main hand, we've got to look at a number of the seats that previously sold. On the other hand, also do not forget the quality of service, right? We kind of deliver a platform to make workforce happy. Let's say you target some other cloud-based service providers. You talk to their customers and talk with our customers. And as you know, we make a customer happy. Enterprise is not only for all those on-prem, the Phone service customers, right, microphone on-prem and the cloud, but also some other cloud-based, the customer also migrate some other cloud-based from services to Zoom platform as well. It further proves we deliver a better experience, make a customer feel happy. That's our momentum, so. Just quickly, Patrick, if you look at the revenue in the base, plus it's extremely positive in terms of cash flow, right? So, why not double down on R&D, new product and accounting executive, right? I think we're more flexible, much better positioned, right, given this sort of a greater resignation, economic downturn. And yes, that's why we're very excited about the future, more innovative services and more efficient. Yes. First of all, we are very excited about the Solvvy acquisition. This is a great team, laser-focused on conversational AI with talent and technology. First of all, we are going to embed that into our overall contact center offering. That's number one for sure. In terms of if we needed to also keep making that product as a stand-alone product, keep adopting on that and sell that service and the stand-alone service, and in the next few weeks, a few months, we are going to discuss that. But overall, we've got to look at the bigger picture, right? Customer, they need a full-blown great contact center experience from Zoom, right? And the Solvvy product will be part of that. And many customers already told us very excited about this acquisition. Sure, absolutely. So, to talk about go-to-market strategy, right, similar to what we did before, I think it worked extremely well, so -- and to build a trust to with customer, right? And given that we have so many very happy customers over the past two years, we truly have the word, happy people stay connected. For any new services, they are very happy to try to test the services, right? Because of that, our sales -- opportunity is huge, right? And we're already stable to trust. Customers are really not like just looking for other solutions, just the work, they really need to have some solution that can truly make an employee for workforce happy, right? Having said that, Zoom IQ for Sales, right, after we launched that, we already have several paid customers. Reason why the customers trust our brand and doing the upsell, the period, right? We always talk to the customer, hey, we have this service, we have that service, right? And overall, I think if trust already is there, any new and upsell opportunity should be relatively easier even if the buyer is different because the CIO, they only made a decision, right, to standardize [ph] Zoom Meetings, the Phone, the Contact Centers, you might give for -- Whiteboard. And also, by the way, do not forget about awesome position to Chat solution as well, right? And that's the reason why customers look at the full usage stack. Zoom has everything, right? That is the key. That's why customers trust us. By the way, we've built everything by ourselves. Very consistent fund and experience, very respectable [ph] backend and also very efficient architecture as well. That's why we are very optimistic about our go-to-market strategy. In terms of marketing, for sure, we do not need to spend so much money to promote Zoom brand, right? Zoom already became a word, right? How to make sure folks on -- it looks like vertical market, right, some in-person events and also the -- stay as close as possible with the prospect and the customers, and that's our focus, right? Not like previously, we really focused on the brand, the marketing. That's not our focus, more of the enterprise market now. Matthew, first of all, thank you for waiting for such a long time. I think look at Wi-Fi or corporate LAN network or 5G, actually, from our perspective, as long as any technology kind of help improve customers' connectivity, making the connection stable, we are very happy, right, especially between 4G and 5G. 5G is great, but not in every country already deployed 5G. And also look at our optimization technology, right? And [Technical Difficulty] and stable network, even 5G. And we also optimize more if needed. Overall, I think anything from infrastructure related can help improve customer with collaboration experience, we are all for it. That's why we cannot have a 5G or 6G. I think that we just make sure we build an application, leverage those advanced infrastructure to truly deliver happiness to our customers. Well, thank you all. Really appreciate. Again, thank you for every Zoom's hard work. Thank you for every customer, partner, investors. We are very, very -- we truly appreciate it. Thank you again. Thank you."

And now, I would like to hand things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, David. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024. I'm joined today by Zoom's Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan; and Zoom's CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.us. Also on this page, you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that along with our earnings release include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the first quarter and full fiscal year 2025; our expectations regarding financial and business trends; impacts from the macroeconomic environment, our market position, opportunities, go-to-market initiatives, growth strategy and business aspirations; and product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today's webinar. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Hey. Thank you, Tom. Thank you everyone for joining us today. In FY \u201824, we made a tremendous amount of progress towards our mission of one platform delivering limitless human connection. As Generative AI began to take the world by storm, we listened carefully to customers in order to deliver AI that can best serve their needs, with innovation that is responsible, empowering, and built from the ground up in a way that permeates and unifies our entire platform. Zoom AI Companion, our generative AI assistant, empowers customers and employees with enhanced productivity, team effectiveness, and skills. Since, its launch only five months ago, we expanded AI Companion to six Zoom products, all included at no additional cost to licensed users. But we are far from done. Our future roadmap for AI is 100% guided by driving customer value. We are hard at work developing new AI capabilities to help customers achieve their unique business objectives and we'll have more to share in a month at Enterprise Connect. We hope to see you all there. Our expanding Contact Center suite is a unified, AI first solution that offers tremendous value to companies of all sizes seeking to strengthen customer relationships and deliver better outcomes. The base product includes AI Companion and our newly launched tiered pricing allows customers to add specialized CX capabilities such as AI Expert Assist, workforce management, quality management, virtual agent, and omnichannel support. Bolstered by its expanding features, our Contact Center suite is beginning to win in head-to-head competition with legacy incumbents. Beyond that, it is competing on its own merits with customers completely new to Zoom, broadening the funnel to the Zoom platform. As Zoom becomes a full workplace solution, we are seeing customers migrate from other chat products onto Zoom Team Chat, very excited. Over the past year, Zoom Team Chat usage has increased 130% across our paid accounts. And our migration tool, designed to simplify the transition, has seen a 4x increase in downloads in the last six months. Customers across industries are moving to Zoom Team Chat including a global supply chain leader, who has migrated over 1,200 users, a major law firm who has migrated 1,500 users, and a financial payments leader, who has moved over 2,000 users. Customers appreciate the improved user experiences and enhanced collaboration driven by our Zoom Team Chat product as well as the cost efficiencies realized by consolidating their communications and collaboration solutions onto Zoom. Last April, we acquired Workvivo and its integration into the Zoom interface has strengthened its market position. In Q4, we upsold a Fortune 10 company and long standing Zoom customer on Workvivo, making it Workvivo's biggest customer to date. And on the flipside, we also saw a global bank, who started as a Workvivo customer, adopt the broader Zoom platform. As you can see, adding new products both organically and inorganically creates a virtuous cycle, allowing us to sell more product into a larger base. We were very pleased to see Workvivo recognized as a leader by Magic Quadrant in its first report on Intranet Packaged Solutions. Similarly, Zoom Revenue Accelerator was recognized as a Strong Performer in The Forrester Wave in its first year of being covered, an amazing testament to its value as a powerful AI-enabled tool driving value for sales teams. FY \u201824 was a difficult year from a macro perspective and we faced those challenges head on. We became more disciplined and focused, while continuing to prioritize growth opportunities. As a result, we are much better positioned than we were one year ago. Our platform moat is deeper, our contact center offering is more robust, and our go-to-market teams are primed with defined goals and sharpened expertise to drive growth and empower our customers. Now, let's talk about some of our amazing customers. First, I'm so excited to welcome Broadcom, a global infrastructure technology leader, to the Zoom family. Recognizing the simplicity and ease of use of our expanding platform, they opted for the Zoom One Enterprise bundle to modernize the way they communicate and collaborate. Let me also thank Diageo, a leading global beverage company, for doubling down on Zoom. Seeing strong value from their existing Meetings, Phone and Rooms deployment, in Q4, they expanded to Zoom Contact Center and Zoom Virtual Agent. Let me also thank Community Financial Credit Union, a full-service financial cooperative, for investing in our broad Zoom One platform. They have chosen to modernize member engagement with Zoom Contact Center. Community Financial chose Zoom because of our one platform, video-first approach to solving all their communications needs. Zoom's integrations with key banking solutions through our APIs and partnerships were core to their decision making process. Finally, let me thank Convera, the World's FX payments leader. Zoom Phone was the foundation of their Zoom engagement and from there, they adopted the wider Zoom One platform in less than two years. Seeing the benefits of the tight integration of our products underpinned by AI Companion, they recently began to deeply leverage Zoom Team Chat in order to streamline their pre, during and post-meeting communication all within the Zoom Platform. Everything we do here is rooted in our culture of delivering happiness. This is why our employees, this is why the customer employees, this is why employees even more than IT departments are our biggest champions. And of course, happy employees are the most productive, so choosing Zoom becomes a win for everyone. We are laser-focused on our mission and could not be more optimistic about our future. The best is yet to come. And with that, I'll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. Let me start with a few of the financial highlights for FY \u201824. We were pleased with our strong finish to the year with Enterprise Revenue growing 9%, and free cash flow up 24%. We also achieved a non-GAAP operating margin of 39.2%, up 326 basis points from 35.9% in FY \u201823. In Q4, we saw traction in our emerging products, including a nearly 3x increase in Zoom Contact Center licenses as we not only added a significant number of new customers but also expanded average deal size. Zoom Phone customers with 10,000 or more seats grew 27% year-over-year to 95. And Zoom AI Companion has grown tremendously in just five months with over 510,000 accounts enabled and 7.2 million meeting summaries created as of the close of FY \u201824. We are excited about the strong growth across these new products and the benefits they drive for our customers. Now, let's dive into the financial results. In Q4, total revenue came in at $1.146 billion, up 3% year-over-year. This result was approximately $16 million above the high end of our guidance. Our Enterprise revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue, up from 57% a year ago. We continued to see improvement in Online Average Monthly Churn, which decreased to 3% from 3.4% in Q4 of FY \u201823. This is consistent with the previous quarter and the lowest churn we have ever reported. The number of Enterprise customers grew 3% year-over-year to approximately 220,400. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q4 came in at 101%. We saw 10% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 3,810 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue. These customers represented 30% of revenue, up from 28% in Q4 of FY \u201923. Our Americas revenue grew 4% year-over-year, while EMEA was flat and APAC declined by 3%. The international performance was partially due to the FX headwinds in APAC as well as the impact from our sales reorganization in early FY \u201824 that took longer to complete internationally than domestically. Moving to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on strategic investments, income tax benefits from discrete activities, and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 79.2%, which was slightly lower than 79.8% in Q4 of last year, mainly due to our investment in AI Companion. In FY \u201825, we expect our gross margin to be approximately 79%, reflecting focused investments in our AI features. Over the course of FY \u201825, we expect to directionally improve gross margin towards our long-term target of 80% as we continue to optimize our data center strategy and grow some of our higher ASP products like Zoom Contact Center. Non-GAAP income from operations grew by 10% year-over-year to $444 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $414 million. This translates to a 38.7% non-GAAP operating margin for Q4, an improvement from 36.2% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share in Q4 was $1.42, on approximately 313 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.27 above the high end of our guidance and $0.20 higher than Q4 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.27 billion, down approximately 3% from Q4 of last year. This was roughly 3 percentage points better than the high end of the range we provided last quarter. For Q1, we expect deferred revenue to be down 4% to 5% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO increased 4% year-over-year to approximately $3.57 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 58% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 56% in Q4 of last year. Operating cash flow in the quarter grew 66% year-over-year to $351 million. Free cash flow grew 81% year-over-year to $333 million. The sharp increase in our cash flow metrics was due to stronger collections, targeted expense management and higher interest income. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow margins expanded to 30.6% and 29%, respectively. We ended the quarter with approximately $7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. Turning to guidance. As we consider our view for Q1 and FY \u201825, we have not assumed any changes in the macroeconomic outlook. For Q1, we expect revenue to be approximately $1.125 billion. This incorporates two fewer days in Q1 and would represent approximately 1.8% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $410 million to $415 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.18 to $1.20 based on approximately 316 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY \u201825, we expect revenue to be approximately $4.6 billion, which represents approximately 1.6% year-over-year growth. We expect Q2 to be the low point from a year-over-year growth perspective and to accelerate from there. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.73 billion representing an operating margin of approximately 37.5%. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share for FY \u201825 is $4.85 to $4.88, based on approximately 321 million shares outstanding. For FY \u201825, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.44 billion to $1.48 billion. We believe that our strong cash flow generation and financial discipline coupled with responsible capital allocation is a powerful combination. As indicated in our earnings press release today, our board has authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program that we will start executing this quarter. This not only underscores the confidence our board and management team have in the future of Zoom, but also allows us to leverage our strong profitability, cash flow and balance sheet to drive shareholder returns, while also allowing us the flexibility to consider M&A options to accelerate growth and deliver for our customers. As a note, the share count and EPS metrics in our guide do not account for the impacts from this repurchase program. To echo what Eric said, we are optimistic about where we are now and where we are going. Our competitive position, innovation engine, and customer base set us up for success in FY \u201825 and beyond. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors for your trust and support. Before closing, I would like to thank just one more person for their support over the years. Our head of IR, Tom McCallum has decided to retire this Summer after a seasoned 25-year IR career. Tom, it's been an honor and a pleasure to work with you. You have contributed tremendously to Zoom's success since before our IPO and will be dearly missed. Thank you so much for all you have done and congratulations. I am pleased to announce that Charles Eveslage, who has worked with Tom and me for several years now, will assume the role. With Charles at the helm, we are confident that the investment community will continue to receive a high level of service from Zoom's IR team. Please hold your goodbyes for Tom for now as he will be with us until mid-year to ensure a smooth transition. With that, David, please queue up the first question.\nOperator: Thank you, Kelly. As Kelly mentioned, we will now move into the Q&A session. When I call your name, please turn on your video and unmute. As a reminder, in an effort to hear from everyone please limit yourself to one question. And our first question comes from William Power with Baird.\nWilliam Power: Okay. Great. Thanks. I guess -- well, Kelly said to hold this for Tom, but Tom wanted to say thank you for your help over the years. Kelly, maybe to kick it off with you, as we look at guidance, maybe just talk about what's providing confidence of the year-over-year growth should trough in Q2 if I heard you right? How do we think about the key drivers then to perhaps accelerate year-over-year growth in the back-half of the year and perhaps into fiscal '26 and how do we think about that trajectory over the ensuing 18 months maybe as we get past that.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So when you think about your coming down in Q2, but then accelerating in the back half. This is the culmination of what we've been talking about for a while, which is the growth being driven by Zoom Phone, by Zoom Contact Center, which we've seen continue to mature by the effect that AI and adoption of Team Chat are having on the overall retention metrics of the company. So, all of those factors are what gives us that confidence that we're going to see it come down in Q2, but then start to reaccelerate after that. And then I mean, it's very early to comment on FY '26, but that would be an indicator that exit-rate for FY '25 would be an indicator for FY '26.\nWilliam Power: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Meta.\nMeta Marshall: Thanks. Just wanted to ask maybe just in terms of, on the deferred revenue in the past quarter, you mentioned that deferred revenue would kind of be down this quarter or we saw it come down. And just wondering, last quarter you talked about the terms that you were seeing, people extending their deals come in a little bit, just any trends that you're seeing just in terms of renewals. And what you're kind of seeing in terms of renewal there in terms of products that they're adding but just also maybe term compression, they might be seeing. Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: So, we've continued to see strength in renewals are, huge thanks to our renewals team in Q4 actually did an amazing job of exceeding their target, which was great to see. And what we have seen is the continued trend of our customers wanting shorter payment terms, they're hanging on to their cash. Remember, we talked about this in Q3, but that's really what contributes to the decrease in deferred. And then the other thing is the timing of renewals. We are seeing customers not necessarily wait to their renewal period to start these discussions. For example, I renewed -- I reviewed a proposal today for a customer that's not going to renew for six months. So, customers are really thinking ahead about their contracts and being very thoughtful about this. And what that does, it creates some variability in both the RPO and the deferred, because it's very sensitive to the timing of these things.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ethan Bruck from Wolfe Research.\nEthan Bruck: Hey, guys. Congrats on these results, and I'm asking a question on behalf of Alex here.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Ethan.\nEthan Bruck: So. I guess my question would just be a little bit back on the guidance for fiscal '25, just if you can give some puts and takes, I know you said you're not factoring macro improvement. But how should we think about both the enterprise and online piece, I know you guys are rolling out some pricing increases. So maybe how to factor that going into numbers for next year. And just also the NRR piece, maybe roughly when you're expecting that to trough, Is there any color on that would be great?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So in terms of the enterprise of the direct sales organization, we kind of touched on this in the prepared remarks, but they're off to a fast start this year, we're really excited about that. If you remember last year, we had not only the overall reduction in the company, but the sales reorganization, which took a lot of time for the organization to recover from frankly and so, seeing them well-positioned to start off this year strong is really exciting to see. And that's certainly going to contribute to the overall growth that we're expecting to see, especially in the back half of the year. And then from an online perspective, really pleased for example with the Q3 churn metric. I think considering that we typically see seasonally higher churn in Q2 and Q4, that churn rate falling from Q3 to Q4 at that lowest rate of 3.0 is really indicative of all the improvements that the team has made to the platform, the ongoing initiatives they put in place. And so all of those considerations is what gives us confidence around the FY '25 guide.\nEthan Bruck: Got it. That makes sense. Just a quick follow-up is just around some of the AI, like you are successfully embedding it across the platform. I'm just curious, as we think about kind of the monetization angles over the next few years. I mean if you were to stack rank where you think the combination of moving users to higher SKUs matching price-value, you guys are obviously already doing or getting folks to adopt more products on the upsell side in the contact center, for example, curious how you guys are thinking about that right now.\nEric Yuan: I can take it. So -- and we're monetizing on many fronts. You look at our Zoom AI Companion, right, so first of all. for our existing customers because they all like the value we created to generate a meeting summary, meeting query and so and so forth, because of that we do really do not -- customers they are trying to review the cost. That's why we do not charge customers for those features. However, a lot of areas we can monetize, in order to take our AI Companion for an example, enterprise customers, how to leverage enterprise customer directionally a sure source data and also to build the -- tailor the Zoom AI Companion for those customers sort of like a customized Zoom AI Companion and we can monetize. And also look at all those services and maybe I'll just take a contact center for example, we're offering Zoom Virtual Agent and that's the one we have to monetize and recently, we announced three tears in our Zoom Contact Center product. The last one is a per agent and per month, we charge $149, the reason why? There are few features, one of the feature is Zoom Expert Assist. But all of those features are empowered by AI features, not to mention, we're also going to build new services and are driven by Zoom AI Companion as well. I think this year, I mean we're going to be doubling down on Zoom AI Companion customization and also focus on monetization. That's our effort.\nEthan Bruck: Got it. Thank you, guys, and congrats on the results.\nEric Yuan: Appreciate it. Say hello to Alex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nTyler Radke: Thank you for taking the question and apologies for the quality, I'm in transit at the moment. Wanted to ask you about the recently announced buyback $1.5 billion is impressive, 7% of your shares outstanding. But, I guess how did you kind of come up with that number, and does that signal anything about the size of potential M&A that you're hoping to do, anything that you can just share in terms of why now, and the decision process would be helpful. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So, we've talked about this many times in the past, every quarter we have this discussion about capital allocation with our Board, of course, with Eric, and with $7 billion sitting on our balance sheet today and the strength of our cash flow outlook for FY '25, we feel confident that having an authorization in place does not preclude us and still provides us plenty of flexibility to do M&A transactions that we might see as exciting in the future. And we continue to look for any opportunities that make sense to bring another organization to the Zoom portfolio. And we were targeting an amount that would approximately offset potentially most of the dilution for FY '25 and that's how we were thinking about it. Of course, you did that quick calculation and math but there's always variability in the execution of these programs and we will be looking -- the way that we execute it is we set an approximate amount, we want to acquire every single quarter. So we'll be evaluating this as we move through the year this year.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Tom Blakey from KeyBanc.\nTom Blakey: Thanks everyone. Good to see you, Eric, and Kelly and congratulations on the, I'll say, early retirement, Tom. Just point of clarification first, Kelly, on I think Meta was asking about 2Q in the guide. And you mentioned something about being that, were you implying just point of clarification that fiscal 2Q would be down quarter-on-quarter from fiscal 1Q?\nKelly Steckelberg: We're saying that the year-over-year growth rate in Q2 will decline as compared to the year-over-year growth rate in Q1. Yes, it will be positive. It won't be -- It's not going to go negative based on our current outlook, but it will be lower than the year-over-year growth rate in Q1.\nTom Blakey: Sorry for the handholding there.\nKelly S. Steckelberg: No, it's okay.\nTom Blakey: My key question would be on CCaaS, it sounds like you're off to a great start. There's a lot of demand out there. Hearing from your peers. I'd love to just give you the opportunity to talk about pricing, uptake of some of the Virtual Agent, Agent Assist functionality and maybe any type of what you've baked into fiscal '25 in terms of visibility here as you come out very strong here in the fourth-quarter -- in the fiscal '25. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Eric, do you want to talk about the Contact Center in general for a minute first?\nEric Yuan: Sure, absolutely. I think Tom you may not know actually, recently I got a new job here at Zoom, I become the Contact Center General Manager of the product management team engineers and our go-to-market team, sales, marketing, they all reporting to me directly. That means huge opportunity ahead of us, why I want to wear another ahead of GM of Contact Center. Seriously, but anyway, so based on customer feedback, very, very positive. We're doing extremely well in every quarter, and Q4 number is amazing and plus the reason why we have confidence introduced like three tiers of pricing, because a lot of customers told us, right. They probably needed a basic contact solutions. The $69 per agent, very competitive, all of the features, or if they want some social channel maybe outbound dialer, they can pay another $30 more per agent. And for a huge enterprise customer want to buy 1,000 agents, and we give them Zoom export Assist and also Workforce Management and Employee Management all of the features, you can see Zoom has become a full suite of Contact Center offering. We can compete head-to-head to the legacy incumbents. I'll give one example, in Zoom, we internally we deployed our Virtual Agent, guess what, every month, we saved 400,000 agent hours. And more than 90% inbound inquiries can be done by our Virtual Agent driven by the AI technology, I'm very excited about everything we're doing. And the feedback are very positive. Again we're going to be doubling down, tripling down on our Contact Center offering because that's a modern solution, AI empowered video first and also we build a full suite. That's why we're so excited.\nKelly Steckelberg: Based on your enthusiasm, Eric, I am going to raise your quota.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. I raise the quota to the system every day. So, there's no difference, so.\nTom Blakey: And Kelly, look what kind of outlook, are you baking in terms of the strength there and the visibility commentary about fiscal '25 and then is that -- this is just enterprise right now, right. This is that no self-service online here, right?\nKelly Steckelberg: Correct.\nEric Yuan: Not yet, but -- yeah, you're right on. See, thank you for helping us to monetize Contact Center in other ways.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So, Tom, we looked at the trends that we've been seeing the number of customers, the growth rate, the size of the deals, which have been expanding over the last several quarters. And just -- and of course, sales capacity and taking all of that in consideration, including the new pricing tiers. That's how we built our outlook for FY '25.\nTom Blakey: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question here. Tom, congrats on the announcement and Eric, good luck with the increased quota from Kelly now. Kelly, just going back to a couple of questions ago, on how to think about the quantitative approach here on past or future price increases on the guide for this year? And for Eric, what's causing customers to move over to the Zoom chat function and off your main competitor like Teams, just further consolidation on the one platform or is it AI Companion playing a larger role here, especially as you guys are concluding it as opposed to $30, $35 a month. Thanks guys.\nEric Yuan: Kelly, you want to take the first one.\nKelly Steckelberg: No, You go ahead. You go ahead first.\nEric Yuan: Sure. So James one thing I think we did not do well, as I mentioned even before is, we did not do well on marketing front. A lot of customers, users, they do not know Zoom has a greater presence in Team Chat functionality at no additional cost. And it works is extremely well. All the key features any other competitor's product they have also have that as well. Very well-integrated with Zoom product. And a plus as new side, you also right on customers they see using their Chat solution, they want to use AI. Let's see, I send you -- James, I send you a message, I want to leverage AI, send a long message, however, if you use the other solutions sometimes other solutions itself even with all AI is not free, right. And in our case, not only our core functionalities, but also AI Companion built in also at no additional cost. I can use it for any users, customers, you already have a meeting license, Zoom Team Chat is already built in, all of the core features, you can use Zoom AI Companion and also let AI write a chat message and as so on and so forth, it works well at no additional cost. The total cost of ownership of a Zoom Team Chat is much better than any other team-tailored solutions and also we built in a native client, not like some other competitors, the web-based client, sometimes like I am using Mac and performance so on and so forth is really not good in [indiscernible] experience. That's the reason why more and more customers, they discovered Zoom team share capabilities, wow, why not move to Zoom platform, they give the Team Chat functionalities at no additional cost, right. That's the reason why we have confidence. I hope more and more customers are going to move to a Zoom Team Chat and will also built a very seamless migration tool as well to have a customer migrate to Zoom Team Chat.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric. In terms of the price increases, James, so certainly be online price increases that we talked about last call, and they were implemented in Q4 are in all of our forward-looking guidance. And then the renewals team as they're talking to our customer about renewals where there are opportunities for price increases, we've seen those trends over the last few quarters have been doing that and that would also show up in the pipeline that the team has out there. So in that context, it's also been considered.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. By the way, James and all, all the analysts that are here. If you are logging with the Zoom client, my email address and we can create a Zoom Team Chat group, and let's get a first-hand experience, how powerful it is. So it's very easy.\nKelly Steckelberg: You can have one-on-one access to Eric, James. [Multiple Speakers]\nJames Fish: Sounds good, Eric, don't worry. I won't annoy you too much.\nEric Yuan: Awesome. Thank you, James.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew VanVliet with BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I guess one more on the Contact Center. Curious in terms of how the mix is maybe different with channel involvement and partners being involved in those deals over the last couple of months as you really invested in the channel program. And then secondarily, what is the mix of I guess, the contact center sales into existing customers especially existing Zoom Phone customers, is that any different than the early days of Zoom Phone in terms of mix? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So, Kelly, feel free to chime in. I think for the core meeting product, by and large is directly driven and Zoom Phone is mix via direct and channel driven. You look at it as Contact Center product, for sure we have a Zoom Contact under specialist here, but I think primarily driven by a lot of, and very well-established third-party agents, right and those are channel partners for they already have great relationships. We have to invest into that area. So, this is the reason why a lot of deals are brought to us by those channel partners, some of them even never used it and they are not Zoom Meeting customers, but also they have become the first Zoom Contact Center customers. So that's kind of a channel and also the Zoom Contact Center specialist. Also at the same time, because Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center are integrated very well and also we're training all those Zoom Phone specialists also o become Zoom Contact Center specialists, right, to further help our work internal net sales capacity as well and I think that overall and you look at the revenue trajectory and Kelly, correct me if I'm wrong, is very similar to our Zoom Phone. And hopefully, after I become GM, maybe we can build that as well, so -- and anyway, so that's where we are now, so.\nKelly Steckelberg: The only thing that I would add to that is, that we're very excited, we hired Chris Morrissey in November. He is a veteran in this space. So really excited to have his talents here at Zoom. And then one other thing to note, which has been interesting about Contact Center is we actually have seen customers -- new customers coming for Zoom Contact Center. So it's also an opportunity to start to bring, expose the platform to new prospects and customers as they're really excited about this really modern technology that we have in Zoom Contact Center.\nMatthew VanVliet: Okay. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. By the way, Chris reports to me directly, he came from NICE, inContact.\nMatthew VanVliet: All right. Great. Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi Siti.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my [Technical Difficulty] So I wanted other growth driver you have, phone. From the phone side, so help us understand, like what's your penetration right now within the installed base on the phone side. And any update in terms of whether a number of states or revenue you have by end of this fiscal year.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we are really excited about the ongoing strength and growth in Zoom Phone. The -- in terms of the opportunity ahead even internally, the penetration rate for deal attach is still under, I think, 20%. So, that just highlights, there is also a greenfield even within our existing Zoom customer base and the metric that we gave this quarter was that customers with greater than 10,000 seats increased 11% year-over-year, or 27% -- sorry 11% quarter-over-quarter, 27% year-over-year to 95. So, seeing lots of strength in that high-end of the customer base, which we're really excited about and we didn't give a seat count metric this quarter, it's probably something that we'll do in the next quarter or two.\nSiti Panigrahi: Thank you.\nOperator: Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: Eric, thank you. Maybe going back to the Contact Center piece and trying to loop in the AI Expert Assist side, when you're when you're seeing customers come in, are they adopting the premium tiers off the bat and do you have a sense of whether the usage of Expert Assist is picking up as a result or is this something that we should think of as a future upsell driver as customers kind of land maybe at the low-end, and then expand over time.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. That's a good question. The reason why we introduced the multi-tiers in Contact Center because if we really look at it from a cost perspective, each customer has reported a dip in the demands or requirements and sometimes they do not care about social media channel, right. And they just need core functionalities, right. Just a few 100 assist and then migrate from other cloud-based upon contact center solution really do not need a Workforce Management or Quality Management, right. That's the reason why we have three tiers now, right. And quite often follow the SMB customer. I think that Zoom Contact Center essentials is good enough, right and we talk with customers with more than 1,000 agents, for sure they would like to have those AI Expert Assist and our Workforce Management or Quality Management and so on so forth, right. That's the reason why because in customer demand, we have multiple tiers and our Contact Center specialists and also partners -- channel partners, working together, right. Based on customer demand, we offer different tiers. We might introduce more in the future. We do not know, but again we look at everything from customer perspective, that's the reason why based on those multi-tier packages, you can see that, with demand coming from every segment, SMB customers, lot of enterprise customers and it's very healthy, so.\nKelly Steckelberg: And just further to what Eric said, the packages are off to a really great start. We've had approximately 3,700 licenses sold in those upper tiers and the ASP for those is double what our existing ASP was before we introduced those additional tiers. So it really shows you how this is going to not only address the broader market, but also accelerate our revenue growth here.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. It used to be a little bit over 50 now it is 100, this is great result, so.\nArjun Bhatia: Great to hear. Awesome. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Imtiaz Koujalgi with Wedbush.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Imtiaz.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Hi. How are you? Thanks for taking my question. I've a question on the guide for next year. Kelly, how do we think about the breakdown between enterprise growth and online for next year, should we see online start growing year-over-year in '25?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. We aren't going to give specific guidance for the segments. But we're really focused on continuing to have stabilization in the online segment, what you saw happen again this quarter is actually both quarter -- both segments were slightly up in Q4, which was great to see and really focusing on the initiatives to drive basically stabilization is how I would think about for FY '25 and the online segment.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Got it. Thanks. And then one follow-up for Eric. Eric, you mentioned increasing deal sizes for Contact Center. Can you compare when a customer buys Zoom Phone and buys Zoom Contact Center, are the deal sizes a lot different or similar because the ASP is a lot higher for Contact Center, but I'm guessing the seat count is lower. How does the seat -- the deal values compare between Phone and Contact Center.\nEric Yuan: I think it's good question. I think for sure I do not think and compare that with Zoom Phone as Zoom Contact Center as and when we started normally is hey have a lot of cost, but the average deal size is relatively small. Now you see the average size of a deal is bigger -- greater and greater, right, this is much better than before. And from that perspective, it's very different in comparison for Zoom Phone. That's the reason why you look at it our Zoom and the three package, right. And earlier the package is behind, I think is $49 per user per month -- per agent per month, it is much bigger than Zoom Phone, right. That's the reason why I think in terms of pricing it is very different. We see that more and more medium and large customers adopt Zoom Contact Center, you can see the average deal size is much bigger and we do not [Technical Difficulty] number of the sales, number of customers but focus on the size of customers, that's very healthy.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Matthew Bullock with Bank of America.\nMatthew Bullock: Hi, Eric, and Kelly. Thanks for the question. I'll be asking one -- we have a microphone today regarding Zoom's progress and roadmap for Contact Center product development. Can you provide an update on the company's near-term priorities in terms of functionality improvement. And then the longer term where is the company's focus to better position the offering for large-scale enterprise deployments? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Great. So first of all, I want to tell you from architecture perspective, we are ready already for bigger, very, very big aligning with customers in terms of number of concrete agents, and we did a test, it works well. For now, but just focus on the future set. Again, we already have lots of features, most of the customers they can deploy Zoom Contact Center without any problem either migrate from legacy contact center solutions providers or migrated from the other cloud solution providers. In terms of new features, I think in next few quarters, like one big feature is PCI compliance, right. We need to support that. And also how to support channel partners, right, and also all of those features, may not be the core features but also like PCI compliance and also the support of the channel partners, right. All of those features, sort of like enterprise-related. So, and we're also working on that and also some like Workforce Management and Quality Management further enhance that and also add a lot of AI features as well. I think, as you can see, in the core feature set already is there, we just need to add a few here and there and I think we are almost 100% ready. Like even for social media channel we already support and the other -- like in the social media channel, how to support more the channels like WhatsApp, right. How to add a WhatsApp there. It is just some corner feature here and is there in the next few quarters. And that's team working very hard on that.\nMatthew Bullock: So, super helpful. Thank you.\nMatthew Bullock: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Mark, are you there? Okay, will move ahead, it's alright.\nKelly Steckelberg: [Multiple Speakers] Excuse me, he just came off mute, there you go.\nEric Yuan: Hi, Mark.\nUnidentified Participant: Sorry about that. This is [indiscernible] on for Mark Murphy. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on all the milestones. You mentioned in your prepared remarks about how AI Companion is into your Contact Center suite of solutions. In our discussions with industry contacts, those sort of applications for gen AI have been pretty scaled -- pretty strong and a lot of customer interest. Are you guys seeing a similar pattern with the customers, is that an area where you're seeing kind of an outsized interest to utilization of AI tool? Thanks.\nEric S. Yuan: Yes. I think it's very similar. I mean, you look at a Zoom meeting product, customers discovered the Zoom AI Companion to help you with a meeting summary and after they discover that feature, and they would like to adopt that. Contact Center is exactly same thing. And like Virtual Agent, Zoom Expert Assist, those are AI features, manager can understand what's going on in real time and also agent can leverage AI to get real time knowledge base and any update about these customers. All these AI features can dramatically improve the agent efficiency, right, that's the reason why it's kind of we're not take a much longer time for those agents to realize the value of AI features, because it is kind of very easy to use and I think the most adopting, I feel like Carnegie Center AI adopt rate probably faster than the other features, so called services.\nUnidentified Participant: Thank you very much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Matthew Harrigan with Benchmark.\nMatthew Harrigan: I'm sorry, I actually wasn't -- I didn't have my hand up. But since you asked, do you have any thoughts on the relative macro strength you're seeing in different markets pacific rim, Japan obviously, Buffett was just extolling the virtues of Japan, it is an investment area right now, Europe, U.S., etc. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. We agree, we see Japan as certainly a very important market for us and it is a core focus for FY '25 is reinvesting and reinvigorating our go-to-market teams in both EMEA and APAC. We have new leadership in some of those markets and are really excited again about the quick start the teams being in market and we're ready to go and look forward to great things from them this year.\nMatthew Harrigan: I'm very facile of that mute button, since I was even expecting being called on, so I probably -- I should get brownie points for that.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Good job. Good to see you, Matthew. Thank you.\nMatthew Harrigan: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Weed with Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you very much. I really appreciate all the detail and it's obviously pretty exciting news to see all the expansion opportunities going on with the enterprise customers, along with kind of maybe a fore coming in with the Online customer groups. I guess two follow-ups, got around the enterprise customers. I don't think you commented on how churn is evolving with those customers. And obviously, with continued tailing NRR. I'm trying to unpack what portion of that coming from churn versus what portion of that is coming from the kind of continued refresh cycle you have with like long-tenured customers that are still coming down on seats. And then the second part is kind of you look through on that NRR and you're talking about some acceleration going on later this year and I think that's starting to mixed in and customers that no longer those long tenure that has seats coming down and it's really being replaced by those that expansion is really in functionality is coming in. If you look at those customers that are kind of past their seat readjustment how expansive are those customers that we can maybe, look forward to out a year or so being a greater portion of the mix.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So it's a really good point here. So we've talked about this a few times, but in FY '24, we know -- we saw that the majority of our customers had a renewal event. So they had the opportunity to work with us as they needed to potentially right size their seat count. Again, our renewals team has done an amazing job of taking the opportunity to talk to them about the opportunity to upgrade to Zoom One, to potentially add-in Zoom Phone or additional products. So, maintaining that spend. So we've seen some shifting around in terms of the overall portfolio, but really focused on maintaining that spend, and what that does is it really situates us very well as those customers start to grow again that the customers are now sitting in different SKUs that potentially are more retentive. And also at a higher price point, honestly, that they can grow into. As they start adding seats again, we do see there's going to be a much lower percentage of our customers that are up for renewal this year that didn't have a renewal event last year. So, we've seen again the majority of our customers, if they had something to work through in terms of rightsizing, we've seen the majority of them had the opportunity to do that in FY '24, so we expect that to have a much lower impact in FY '25.\nPeter Weed: And the churn side of it. How much of the roll-off and NRR is because churn has gone up or is it continuing to be what it has always been on the enterprise side pretty stable?\nKelly Steckelberg: It's been pretty stable. We did -- we've talked about, these customers that we're rightsizing. You saw -- given the reduction that we saw across our customer base and you saw generally in organizations last year there was some impact for that, but the churn rate themselves have been pretty stable. And you remember that our net RR number is a trailing 12-month metric. So you're likely going to see a little more decline in that metric before it starts to reaccelerate again along with our revenue that we're expecting to see at the back half of this year.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. I appreciate it.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Our next question comes from Shelby Seyrafi with FBN Securities.\nShelby Seyrafi: Yeah. Thank you very much. So adjusted for the two fewer days in Q1, you're guiding for a 3.6% -- 4% growth in Q1 and for the year, you're guiding for about 1.5% growth. I know you are bottoming Q2 but it seems like with a reasonable projection still going to be like 2% growth roughly half the 4% growth in Q1 in the back half of the year, you're going to have these new products ramping, the Phone, the Contact Center, AI, etc. I'm trying to understand why you don't expect an adjusted revenue growth acceleration in the back half instead of the implied deceleration, I get in my model.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. We do -- we are guiding to 1.8% in Q1. So that's the outlook that we're giving. If you're backing into something different, but the guidance that we're giving is a reminder is 1.8% and then 1.6% for the full year, with the decline that we're expecting from a year-over-year growth perspective in Q2.\nShelby Seyrafi: Let me be clear, but Q1 has a 1.8% hit from the two fewer days. So adjusted for that is 3.6% growth in Q1, right. So apples-to-apples 3.6 goes down something like 1 or 2 in the back half of the year and you have new products ramping in the back half of the year. So, I am trying to [Multiple Speakers] on that.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are not assuming any improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook and/or changes significantly in terms of our international contribution. So all of that combined, we're taking what we believe to be an appropriately prudent outlook for the year.\nShelby Seyrafi: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Rosenblatt Securities.\nCatharine Trebnick: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Much appreciate it.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Catharine.\nCatharine Trebnick: So back to the Contact Center, to beat a dead horse, it seems like there is this -- a lot of the Information I gathered was there's a big push for light contact centers and it seems that Zoom fits it quite well with your pricing model. And when I say light, I mean those are non-agents versus agents. So, we've like a split for the quarter that you were willing to share that would be agent versus non-agent. I'm just trying to get a good handle on that growth outside the traditional agents for a license because there seems to be a good opportunity there.\nEric Yuan: I think direction-wise, you're still right. And on the one hand for the real human agent they still need a modern contact center solution while working hard on that to replace legacy vendor solutions or other cloud-based solutions. On the other hand and if it is more and more demand I think on the customers, they are not going a human agent anymore, right. can have a virtual agent. I think that is the reason we also sell Zoom Virtual Agent as well. I think maybe in the next few quarters and maybe ready to disclose that, for now I do not think we are ready to disclose that number, but we focus on both side and either you do not have more agent, you can have the AI. This is good or you can buy agents, that's okay too. So -- and that's our plan.\nCatharine Trebnick: All right. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Peter Levine with Evercore.\nPeter Levine: Well, great, thanks for squeezing me. And I'll just give you a quick. Kelly, your comments on M&A, can you share with us what you're thinking in terms of inorganic contributions, but what area would you consider is at CCaaS, is it like workflow optimization, you have got collaboration, but any sense on kind of where you're thinking or how you're thinking about adding to the portfolio. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. We've been exploring opportunities actually across all of those areas, Peter, we look for opportunities to either accelerate what we already have, which would obviously be in the CCaaS space and a good example is, what we did in the past with Solvvy around our Zoom Virtual Agent product or something that sits a little bit next to it which Workvivo is a great example of that as well. So we're continuing to look in areas both within our current portfolio as well as around us with things like productivity tools. That's how we're thinking about. Eric, is there anything you want to add?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. You're just right on, just either technology-driven or just expand on the cap[ph] or maybe double down on our existing services. Pretty much those three things. We're interested in all three.\nPeter Levine: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. We only have time for one more question and that comes from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thanks for taking me. Kelly, maybe expanding on your comments on the sales side and the reorg, how do you feel about your productivity in North America and internationally, and when you look at investing this year, where are you putting the most effort?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So you saw in our results for Q3 and Q4 that we had reacceleration and sales productivity in the back half of FY '24, and again, off to a really fast start for FY '25. So excited about that. We are investing in both direct and channel on a global basis, as it's really important that we keep fueling the growth driver that we have here in North America, but also reinvesting and reinvigorating our international markets as well.\nGeorge Iwanyc: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. Thank you, everyone. This concludes our Q&A and. I would now like to pass things back to Eric for closing comments.\nEric Yuan: Well, thank you all for your support and thank you all for your time. Really appreciate it. And see you next quarter. Thank you.\nOperator: Again, this concludes today's release. We thank you all for your participation -- from our family to yours. Thank you.",

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. Let me start with a few of the financial highlights for FY \u201824. We were pleased with our strong finish to the year with Enterprise Revenue growing 9%, and free cash flow up 24%. We also achieved a non-GAAP operating margin of 39.2%, up 326 basis points from 35.9% in FY \u201823. In Q4, we saw traction in our emerging products, including a nearly 3x increase in Zoom Contact Center licenses as we not only added a significant number of new customers but also expanded average deal size. Zoom Phone customers with 10,000 or more seats grew 27% year-over-year to 95. And Zoom AI Companion has grown tremendously in just five months with over 510,000 accounts enabled and 7.2 million meeting summaries created as of the close of FY \u201824. We are excited about the strong growth across these new products and the benefits they drive for our customers. Now, let's dive into the financial results. In Q4, total revenue came in at $1.146 billion, up 3% year-over-year. This result was approximately $16 million above the high end of our guidance. Our Enterprise revenue grew 5% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue, up from 57% a year ago. We continued to see improvement in Online Average Monthly Churn, which decreased to 3% from 3.4% in Q4 of FY \u201823. This is consistent with the previous quarter and the lowest churn we have ever reported. The number of Enterprise customers grew 3% year-over-year to approximately 220,400. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q4 came in at 101%. We saw 10% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 3,810 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12-month revenue. These customers represented 30% of revenue, up from 28% in Q4 of FY '23. Our Americas revenue grew 4% year-over-year, while EMEA was flat and APAC declined by 3%. The international performance was partially due to the FX headwinds in APAC as well as the impact from our sales reorganization in early FY \u201824 that took longer to complete internationally than domestically. Moving to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on strategic investments, income tax benefits from discrete activities, and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q4 was 79.2%, which was slightly lower than 79.8% in Q4 of last year, mainly due to our investment in AI Companion. In FY \u201825, we expect our gross margin to be approximately 79%, reflecting focused investments in our AI features. Over the course of FY \u201825, we expect to directionally improve gross margin towards our long-term target of 80% as we continue to optimize our data center strategy and grow some of our higher ASP products like Zoom Contact Center. Non-GAAP income from operations grew by 10% year-over-year to $444 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $414 million. This translates to a 38.7% non-GAAP operating margin for Q4, an improvement from 36.2% in Q4 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted net income per share in Q4 was $1.42, on approximately 313 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.27 above the high end of our guidance and $0.20 higher than Q4 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.27 billion, down approximately 3% from Q4 of last year. This was roughly 3 percentage points better than the high end of the range we provided last quarter. For Q1, we expect deferred revenue to be down 4% to 5% year-over-year. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO increased 4% year-over-year to approximately $3.57 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 58% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 56% in Q4 of last year. Operating cash flow in the quarter grew 66% year-over-year to $351 million. Free cash flow grew 81% year-over-year to $333 million. The sharp increase in our cash flow metrics was due to stronger collections, targeted expense management and higher interest income. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow margins expanded to 30.6% and 29%, respectively. We ended the quarter with approximately $7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. Turning to guidance. As we consider our view for Q1 and FY \u201825, we have not assumed any changes in the macroeconomic outlook. For Q1, we expect revenue to be approximately $1.125 billion. This incorporates two fewer days in Q1 and would represent approximately 1.8% year-over-year growth. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $410 million to $415 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.18 to $1.20 based on approximately 316 million shares outstanding. For the full year of FY \u201825, we expect revenue to be approximately $4.6 billion, which represents approximately 1.6% year-over-year growth. We expect Q2 to be the low point from a year-over-year growth perspective and to accelerate from there. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.72 billion to $1.73 billion representing an operating margin of approximately 37.5%. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share for FY \u201825 is $4.85 to $4.88, based on approximately 321 million shares outstanding. For FY \u201825, we expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.44 billion to $1.48 billion. We believe that our strong cash flow generation and financial discipline coupled with responsible capital allocation is a powerful combination. As indicated in our earnings press release today, our board has authorized a $1.5 billion share repurchase program that we will start executing this quarter. This not only underscores the confidence our board and management team have in the future of Zoom, but also allows us to leverage our strong profitability, cash flow and balance sheet to drive shareholder returns, while also allowing us the flexibility to consider M&A options to accelerate growth and deliver for our customers. As a note, the share count and EPS metrics in our guide do not account for the impacts from this repurchase program. To echo what Eric said, we are optimistic about where we are now and where we are going. Our competitive position, innovation engine, and customer base set us up for success in FY \u201825 and beyond. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors for your trust and support. Before closing, I would like to thank just one more person for their support over the years. Our head of IR, Tom McCallum has decided to retire this Summer after a seasoned 25-year IR career. Tom, it's been an honor and a pleasure to work with you. You have contributed tremendously to Zoom's success since before our IPO and will be dearly missed. Thank you so much for all you have done and congratulations. I am pleased to announce that Charles Eveslage, who has worked with Tom and me for several years now, will assume the role. With Charles at the helm, we are confident that the investment community will continue to receive a high level of service from Zoom's IR team. Please hold your goodbyes for Tom for now as he will be with us until mid-year to ensure a smooth transition. With that, David, please queue up the first question. Yeah. So when you think about your coming down in Q2, but then accelerating in the back half. This is the culmination of what we've been talking about for a while, which is the growth being driven by Zoom Phone, by Zoom Contact Center, which we've seen continue to mature by the effect that AI and adoption of Team Chat are having on the overall retention metrics of the company. So, all of those factors are what gives us that confidence that we're going to see it come down in Q2, but then start to reaccelerate after that. And then I mean, it's very early to comment on FY '26, but that would be an indicator that exit-rate for FY '25 would be an indicator for FY '26. Hi, Meta. So, we've continued to see strength in renewals are, huge thanks to our renewals team in Q4 actually did an amazing job of exceeding their target, which was great to see. And what we have seen is the continued trend of our customers wanting shorter payment terms, they're hanging on to their cash. Remember, we talked about this in Q3, but that's really what contributes to the decrease in deferred. And then the other thing is the timing of renewals. We are seeing customers not necessarily wait to their renewal period to start these discussions. For example, I renewed -- I reviewed a proposal today for a customer that's not going to renew for six months. So, customers are really thinking ahead about their contracts and being very thoughtful about this. And what that does, it creates some variability in both the RPO and the deferred, because it's very sensitive to the timing of these things. Hi, Ethan. Yeah. So in terms of the enterprise of the direct sales organization, we kind of touched on this in the prepared remarks, but they're off to a fast start this year, we're really excited about that. If you remember last year, we had not only the overall reduction in the company, but the sales reorganization, which took a lot of time for the organization to recover from frankly and so, seeing them well-positioned to start off this year strong is really exciting to see. And that's certainly going to contribute to the overall growth that we're expecting to see, especially in the back half of the year. And then from an online perspective, really pleased for example with the Q3 churn metric. I think considering that we typically see seasonally higher churn in Q2 and Q4, that churn rate falling from Q3 to Q4 at that lowest rate of 3.0 is really indicative of all the improvements that the team has made to the platform, the ongoing initiatives they put in place. And so all of those considerations is what gives us confidence around the FY '25 guide. Yeah. So, we've talked about this many times in the past, every quarter we have this discussion about capital allocation with our Board, of course, with Eric, and with $7 billion sitting on our balance sheet today and the strength of our cash flow outlook for FY '25, we feel confident that having an authorization in place does not preclude us and still provides us plenty of flexibility to do M&A transactions that we might see as exciting in the future. And we continue to look for any opportunities that make sense to bring another organization to the Zoom portfolio. And we were targeting an amount that would approximately offset potentially most of the dilution for FY '25 and that's how we were thinking about it. Of course, you did that quick calculation and math but there's always variability in the execution of these programs and we will be looking -- the way that we execute it is we set an approximate amount, we want to acquire every single quarter. So we'll be evaluating this as we move through the year this year. We're saying that the year-over-year growth rate in Q2 will decline as compared to the year-over-year growth rate in Q1. Yes, it will be positive. It won't be -- It's not going to go negative based on our current outlook, but it will be lower than the year-over-year growth rate in Q1. Eric, do you want to talk about the Contact Center in general for a minute first? Based on your enthusiasm, Eric, I am going to raise your quota. Correct. Yeah. So, Tom, we looked at the trends that we've been seeing the number of customers, the growth rate, the size of the deals, which have been expanding over the last several quarters. And just -- and of course, sales capacity and taking all of that in consideration, including the new pricing tiers. That's how we built our outlook for FY '25. Yeah. No, You go ahead. You go ahead first. Thank you, Eric. In terms of the price increases, James, so certainly be online price increases that we talked about last call, and they were implemented in Q4 are in all of our forward-looking guidance. And then the renewals team as they're talking to our customer about renewals where there are opportunities for price increases, we've seen those trends over the last few quarters have been doing that and that would also show up in the pipeline that the team has out there. So in that context, it's also been considered. You can have one-on-one access to Eric, James. [Multiple Speakers] The only thing that I would add to that is, that we're very excited, we hired Chris Morrissey in November. He is a veteran in this space. So really excited to have his talents here at Zoom. And then one other thing to note, which has been interesting about Contact Center is we actually have seen customers -- new customers coming for Zoom Contact Center. So it's also an opportunity to start to bring, expose the platform to new prospects and customers as they're really excited about this really modern technology that we have in Zoom Contact Center. Hi Siti. Yeah. So we are really excited about the ongoing strength and growth in Zoom Phone. The -- in terms of the opportunity ahead even internally, the penetration rate for deal attach is still under, I think, 20%. So, that just highlights, there is also a greenfield even within our existing Zoom customer base and the metric that we gave this quarter was that customers with greater than 10,000 seats increased 11% year-over-year, or 27% -- sorry 11% quarter-over-quarter, 27% year-over-year to 95. So, seeing lots of strength in that high-end of the customer base, which we're really excited about and we didn't give a seat count metric this quarter, it's probably something that we'll do in the next quarter or two. And just further to what Eric said, the packages are off to a really great start. We've had approximately 3,700 licenses sold in those upper tiers and the ASP for those is double what our existing ASP was before we introduced those additional tiers. So it really shows you how this is going to not only address the broader market, but also accelerate our revenue growth here. Hi, Imtiaz. Yeah. We aren't going to give specific guidance for the segments. But we're really focused on continuing to have stabilization in the online segment, what you saw happen again this quarter is actually both quarter -- both segments were slightly up in Q4, which was great to see and really focusing on the initiatives to drive basically stabilization is how I would think about for FY '25 and the online segment. [Multiple Speakers] Excuse me, he just came off mute, there you go. Yeah. We agree, we see Japan as certainly a very important market for us and it is a core focus for FY '25 is reinvesting and reinvigorating our go-to-market teams in both EMEA and APAC. We have new leadership in some of those markets and are really excited again about the quick start the teams being in market and we're ready to go and look forward to great things from them this year. Good job. Good to see you, Matthew. Thank you. Yeah. So it's a really good point here. So we've talked about this a few times, but in FY '24, we know -- we saw that the majority of our customers had a renewal event. So they had the opportunity to work with us as they needed to potentially right size their seat count. Again, our renewals team has done an amazing job of taking the opportunity to talk to them about the opportunity to upgrade to Zoom One, to potentially add-in Zoom Phone or additional products. So, maintaining that spend. So we've seen some shifting around in terms of the overall portfolio, but really focused on maintaining that spend, and what that does is it really situates us very well as those customers start to grow again that the customers are now sitting in different SKUs that potentially are more retentive. And also at a higher price point, honestly, that they can grow into. As they start adding seats again, we do see there's going to be a much lower percentage of our customers that are up for renewal this year that didn't have a renewal event last year. So, we've seen again the majority of our customers, if they had something to work through in terms of rightsizing, we've seen the majority of them had the opportunity to do that in FY '24, so we expect that to have a much lower impact in FY '25. It's been pretty stable. We did -- we've talked about, these customers that we're rightsizing. You saw -- given the reduction that we saw across our customer base and you saw generally in organizations last year there was some impact for that, but the churn rate themselves have been pretty stable. And you remember that our net RR number is a trailing 12-month metric. So you're likely going to see a little more decline in that metric before it starts to reaccelerate again along with our revenue that we're expecting to see at the back half of this year. Yeah. Yeah. We do -- we are guiding to 1.8% in Q1. So that's the outlook that we're giving. If you're backing into something different, but the guidance that we're giving is a reminder is 1.8% and then 1.6% for the full year, with the decline that we're expecting from a year-over-year growth perspective in Q2. Yeah. So as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are not assuming any improvement in the overall macroeconomic outlook and/or changes significantly in terms of our international contribution. So all of that combined, we're taking what we believe to be an appropriately prudent outlook for the year. Hi, Catharine. Yeah. We've been exploring opportunities actually across all of those areas, Peter, we look for opportunities to either accelerate what we already have, which would obviously be in the CCaaS space and a good example is, what we did in the past with Solvvy around our Zoom Virtual Agent product or something that sits a little bit next to it which Workvivo is a great example of that as well. So we're continuing to look in areas both within our current portfolio as well as around us with things like productivity tools. That's how we're thinking about. Eric, is there anything you want to add? Yeah. So you saw in our results for Q3 and Q4 that we had reacceleration and sales productivity in the back half of FY '24, and again, off to a really fast start for FY '25. So excited about that. We are investing in both direct and channel on a global basis, as it's really important that we keep fueling the growth driver that we have here in North America, but also reinvesting and reinvigorating our international markets as well."

            "content": "Hey. Thank you, Tom. Thank you everyone for joining us today. In FY \u201824, we made a tremendous amount of progress towards our mission of one platform delivering limitless human connection. As Generative AI began to take the world by storm, we listened carefully to customers in order to deliver AI that can best serve their needs, with innovation that is responsible, empowering, and built from the ground up in a way that permeates and unifies our entire platform. Zoom AI Companion, our generative AI assistant, empowers customers and employees with enhanced productivity, team effectiveness, and skills. Since, its launch only five months ago, we expanded AI Companion to six Zoom products, all included at no additional cost to licensed users. But we are far from done. Our future roadmap for AI is 100% guided by driving customer value. We are hard at work developing new AI capabilities to help customers achieve their unique business objectives and we'll have more to share in a month at Enterprise Connect. We hope to see you all there. Our expanding Contact Center suite is a unified, AI first solution that offers tremendous value to companies of all sizes seeking to strengthen customer relationships and deliver better outcomes. The base product includes AI Companion and our newly launched tiered pricing allows customers to add specialized CX capabilities such as AI Expert Assist, workforce management, quality management, virtual agent, and omnichannel support. Bolstered by its expanding features, our Contact Center suite is beginning to win in head-to-head competition with legacy incumbents. Beyond that, it is competing on its own merits with customers completely new to Zoom, broadening the funnel to the Zoom platform. As Zoom becomes a full workplace solution, we are seeing customers migrate from other chat products onto Zoom Team Chat, very excited. Over the past year, Zoom Team Chat usage has increased 130% across our paid accounts. And our migration tool, designed to simplify the transition, has seen a 4x increase in downloads in the last six months. Customers across industries are moving to Zoom Team Chat including a global supply chain leader, who has migrated over 1,200 users, a major law firm who has migrated 1,500 users, and a financial payments leader, who has moved over 2,000 users. Customers appreciate the improved user experiences and enhanced collaboration driven by our Zoom Team Chat product as well as the cost efficiencies realized by consolidating their communications and collaboration solutions onto Zoom. Last April, we acquired Workvivo and its integration into the Zoom interface has strengthened its market position. In Q4, we upsold a Fortune 10 company and long standing Zoom customer on Workvivo, making it Workvivo's biggest customer to date. And on the flipside, we also saw a global bank, who started as a Workvivo customer, adopt the broader Zoom platform. As you can see, adding new products both organically and inorganically creates a virtuous cycle, allowing us to sell more product into a larger base. We were very pleased to see Workvivo recognized as a leader by Magic Quadrant in its first report on Intranet Packaged Solutions. Similarly, Zoom Revenue Accelerator was recognized as a Strong Performer in The Forrester Wave in its first year of being covered, an amazing testament to its value as a powerful AI-enabled tool driving value for sales teams. FY \u201824 was a difficult year from a macro perspective and we faced those challenges head on. We became more disciplined and focused, while continuing to prioritize growth opportunities. As a result, we are much better positioned than we were one year ago. Our platform moat is deeper, our contact center offering is more robust, and our go-to-market teams are primed with defined goals and sharpened expertise to drive growth and empower our customers. Now, let's talk about some of our amazing customers. First, I'm so excited to welcome Broadcom, a global infrastructure technology leader, to the Zoom family. Recognizing the simplicity and ease of use of our expanding platform, they opted for the Zoom One Enterprise bundle to modernize the way they communicate and collaborate. Let me also thank Diageo, a leading global beverage company, for doubling down on Zoom. Seeing strong value from their existing Meetings, Phone and Rooms deployment, in Q4, they expanded to Zoom Contact Center and Zoom Virtual Agent. Let me also thank Community Financial Credit Union, a full-service financial cooperative, for investing in our broad Zoom One platform. They have chosen to modernize member engagement with Zoom Contact Center. Community Financial chose Zoom because of our one platform, video-first approach to solving all their communications needs. Zoom's integrations with key banking solutions through our APIs and partnerships were core to their decision making process. Finally, let me thank Convera, the World's FX payments leader. Zoom Phone was the foundation of their Zoom engagement and from there, they adopted the wider Zoom One platform in less than two years. Seeing the benefits of the tight integration of our products underpinned by AI Companion, they recently began to deeply leverage Zoom Team Chat in order to streamline their pre, during and post-meeting communication all within the Zoom Platform. Everything we do here is rooted in our culture of delivering happiness. This is why our employees, this is why the customer employees, this is why employees even more than IT departments are our biggest champions. And of course, happy employees are the most productive, so choosing Zoom becomes a win for everyone. We are laser-focused on our mission and could not be more optimistic about our future. The best is yet to come. And with that, I'll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you. I can take it. So -- and we're monetizing on many fronts. You look at our Zoom AI Companion, right, so first of all. for our existing customers because they all like the value we created to generate a meeting summary, meeting query and so and so forth, because of that we do really do not -- customers they are trying to review the cost. That's why we do not charge customers for those features. However, a lot of areas we can monetize, in order to take our AI Companion for an example, enterprise customers, how to leverage enterprise customer directionally a sure source data and also to build the -- tailor the Zoom AI Companion for those customers sort of like a customized Zoom AI Companion and we can monetize. And also look at all those services and maybe I'll just take a contact center for example, we're offering Zoom Virtual Agent and that's the one we have to monetize and recently, we announced three tears in our Zoom Contact Center product. The last one is a per agent and per month, we charge $149, the reason why? There are few features, one of the feature is Zoom Expert Assist. But all of those features are empowered by AI features, not to mention, we're also going to build new services and are driven by Zoom AI Companion as well. I think this year, I mean we're going to be doubling down on Zoom AI Companion customization and also focus on monetization. That's our effort. Appreciate it. Say hello to Alex. Sure, absolutely. I think Tom you may not know actually, recently I got a new job here at Zoom, I become the Contact Center General Manager of the product management team engineers and our go-to-market team, sales, marketing, they all reporting to me directly. That means huge opportunity ahead of us, why I want to wear another ahead of GM of Contact Center. Seriously, but anyway, so based on customer feedback, very, very positive. We're doing extremely well in every quarter, and Q4 number is amazing and plus the reason why we have confidence introduced like three tiers of pricing, because a lot of customers told us, right. They probably needed a basic contact solutions. The $69 per agent, very competitive, all of the features, or if they want some social channel maybe outbound dialer, they can pay another $30 more per agent. And for a huge enterprise customer want to buy 1,000 agents, and we give them Zoom export Assist and also Workforce Management and Employee Management all of the features, you can see Zoom has become a full suite of Contact Center offering. We can compete head-to-head to the legacy incumbents. I'll give one example, in Zoom, we internally we deployed our Virtual Agent, guess what, every month, we saved 400,000 agent hours. And more than 90% inbound inquiries can be done by our Virtual Agent driven by the AI technology, I'm very excited about everything we're doing. And the feedback are very positive. Again we're going to be doubling down, tripling down on our Contact Center offering because that's a modern solution, AI empowered video first and also we build a full suite. That's why we're so excited. Yeah. I raise the quota to the system every day. So, there's no difference, so. Not yet, but -- yeah, you're right on. See, thank you for helping us to monetize Contact Center in other ways. Kelly, you want to take the first one. Sure. So James one thing I think we did not do well, as I mentioned even before is, we did not do well on marketing front. A lot of customers, users, they do not know Zoom has a greater presence in Team Chat functionality at no additional cost. And it works is extremely well. All the key features any other competitor's product they have also have that as well. Very well-integrated with Zoom product. And a plus as new side, you also right on customers they see using their Chat solution, they want to use AI. Let's see, I send you -- James, I send you a message, I want to leverage AI, send a long message, however, if you use the other solutions sometimes other solutions itself even with all AI is not free, right. And in our case, not only our core functionalities, but also AI Companion built in also at no additional cost. I can use it for any users, customers, you already have a meeting license, Zoom Team Chat is already built in, all of the core features, you can use Zoom AI Companion and also let AI write a chat message and as so on and so forth, it works well at no additional cost. The total cost of ownership of a Zoom Team Chat is much better than any other team-tailored solutions and also we built in a native client, not like some other competitors, the web-based client, sometimes like I am using Mac and performance so on and so forth is really not good in [indiscernible] experience. That's the reason why more and more customers, they discovered Zoom team share capabilities, wow, why not move to Zoom platform, they give the Team Chat functionalities at no additional cost, right. That's the reason why we have confidence. I hope more and more customers are going to move to a Zoom Team Chat and will also built a very seamless migration tool as well to have a customer migrate to Zoom Team Chat. Yeah. By the way, James and all, all the analysts that are here. If you are logging with the Zoom client, my email address and we can create a Zoom Team Chat group, and let's get a first-hand experience, how powerful it is. So it's very easy. Awesome. Thank you, James. Yeah. So, Kelly, feel free to chime in. I think for the core meeting product, by and large is directly driven and Zoom Phone is mix via direct and channel driven. You look at it as Contact Center product, for sure we have a Zoom Contact under specialist here, but I think primarily driven by a lot of, and very well-established third-party agents, right and those are channel partners for they already have great relationships. We have to invest into that area. So, this is the reason why a lot of deals are brought to us by those channel partners, some of them even never used it and they are not Zoom Meeting customers, but also they have become the first Zoom Contact Center customers. So that's kind of a channel and also the Zoom Contact Center specialist. Also at the same time, because Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center are integrated very well and also we're training all those Zoom Phone specialists also o become Zoom Contact Center specialists, right, to further help our work internal net sales capacity as well and I think that overall and you look at the revenue trajectory and Kelly, correct me if I'm wrong, is very similar to our Zoom Phone. And hopefully, after I become GM, maybe we can build that as well, so -- and anyway, so that's where we are now, so. Yeah. By the way, Chris reports to me directly, he came from NICE, inContact. Thank you. Yeah. That's a good question. The reason why we introduced the multi-tiers in Contact Center because if we really look at it from a cost perspective, each customer has reported a dip in the demands or requirements and sometimes they do not care about social media channel, right. And they just need core functionalities, right. Just a few 100 assist and then migrate from other cloud-based upon contact center solution really do not need a Workforce Management or Quality Management, right. That's the reason why we have three tiers now, right. And quite often follow the SMB customer. I think that Zoom Contact Center essentials is good enough, right and we talk with customers with more than 1,000 agents, for sure they would like to have those AI Expert Assist and our Workforce Management or Quality Management and so on so forth, right. That's the reason why because in customer demand, we have multiple tiers and our Contact Center specialists and also partners -- channel partners, working together, right. Based on customer demand, we offer different tiers. We might introduce more in the future. We do not know, but again we look at everything from customer perspective, that's the reason why based on those multi-tier packages, you can see that, with demand coming from every segment, SMB customers, lot of enterprise customers and it's very healthy, so. Yeah. It used to be a little bit over 50 now it is 100, this is great result, so. Thank you. I think it's good question. I think for sure I do not think and compare that with Zoom Phone as Zoom Contact Center as and when we started normally is hey have a lot of cost, but the average deal size is relatively small. Now you see the average size of a deal is bigger -- greater and greater, right, this is much better than before. And from that perspective, it's very different in comparison for Zoom Phone. That's the reason why you look at it our Zoom and the three package, right. And earlier the package is behind, I think is $49 per user per month -- per agent per month, it is much bigger than Zoom Phone, right. That's the reason why I think in terms of pricing it is very different. We see that more and more medium and large customers adopt Zoom Contact Center, you can see the average deal size is much bigger and we do not [Technical Difficulty] number of the sales, number of customers but focus on the size of customers, that's very healthy. Thank you. Yes. Great. So first of all, I want to tell you from architecture perspective, we are ready already for bigger, very, very big aligning with customers in terms of number of concrete agents, and we did a test, it works well. For now, but just focus on the future set. Again, we already have lots of features, most of the customers they can deploy Zoom Contact Center without any problem either migrate from legacy contact center solutions providers or migrated from the other cloud solution providers. In terms of new features, I think in next few quarters, like one big feature is PCI compliance, right. We need to support that. And also how to support channel partners, right, and also all of those features, may not be the core features but also like PCI compliance and also the support of the channel partners, right. All of those features, sort of like enterprise-related. So, and we're also working on that and also some like Workforce Management and Quality Management further enhance that and also add a lot of AI features as well. I think, as you can see, in the core feature set already is there, we just need to add a few here and there and I think we are almost 100% ready. Like even for social media channel we already support and the other -- like in the social media channel, how to support more the channels like WhatsApp, right. How to add a WhatsApp there. It is just some corner feature here and is there in the next few quarters. And that's team working very hard on that. Hi, Mark. Thank you. Thank you. I think direction-wise, you're still right. And on the one hand for the real human agent they still need a modern contact center solution while working hard on that to replace legacy vendor solutions or other cloud-based solutions. On the other hand and if it is more and more demand I think on the customers, they are not going a human agent anymore, right. can have a virtual agent. I think that is the reason we also sell Zoom Virtual Agent as well. I think maybe in the next few quarters and maybe ready to disclose that, for now I do not think we are ready to disclose that number, but we focus on both side and either you do not have more agent, you can have the AI. This is good or you can buy agents, that's okay too. So -- and that's our plan. Thank you. Yeah. You're just right on, just either technology-driven or just expand on the cap[ph] or maybe double down on our existing services. Pretty much those three things. We're interested in all three. Appreciate it. Thank you. Well, thank you all for your support and thank you all for your time. Really appreciate it. And see you next quarter. Thank you."

And now, I will hand things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations. Tom, over to you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Kelcey. Hello everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the third quarter of FY \u201924. I\u2019m joined today by Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, and Zoom\u2019s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.us. Also, on this page you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding financial and business trends; impacts from the macroeconomic environment, our market position, opportunities, go-to-market initiatives, growth strategy and business aspirations; and product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to the risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and quarterly reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements we may make on today\u2019s webinar. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Hey. Thank you, Tom. Thank you everyone for joining us today. In early October, we hosted Zoomtopia, our yearly customer and innovation-focused event, and it was awesome. Like last year, we ran it hybrid on Zoom Events, thousands joined us in person and many multiples of that virtually. Among the in person attendees were 40 customer presenters such as JP Morgan, MIT, Boston Consulting Group, HubSpot and Kohls, who spoke about their amazing experiences on Zoom and excitement about the future. We also showcased newly-released innovations like Zoom AI Companion, as well as Zoom AI Expert Assist and Quality Management for the Contact Center. Zoom AI Companion is especially noteworthy for being included at no additional cost to our paid plans, and has fared tremendously well with over 220,000 accounts enabling it and 2.8 million meeting summaries created as of today. Remarkable growth in less than three months. At Zoomtopia, I also had the pleasure of sharing the stage with Flex, a global manufacturing and supply chain leader, who spoke about how they use Zoom to connect their large, distributed workforce of 170,000 employees across 30 countries. Flex started using Zoom Meetings in 2017, quickly followed by Rooms and Team Chat. Since then, Flex increased Team Chat users by 200% and Zoom Rooms by 245%. They also became power users of Zoom Whiteboard, creating over 13,000 Whiteboards. And moving to Zoom Phone allowed them to eliminate 50 to 70% of circuits and infrastructure across the globe, and reduce total cost of ownership. We were so happy to have Flex share their journey at Zoomtopia, and it cannot wait for what is in store for our partnership next. Now moving on to some of our customer wins in Q3. First, let me thank Dropbox, who has been an amazing customer for many years starting with Meetings and then extending to Rooms, Phone and Events. In Q3, they selected Zoom Virtual Agent and Zoom Contact Center to provide world-class AI-enabled support to their global user base. Let me also thank Amynta Group, a premier insurance services company, who initially adopted Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center on a limited scale in Q1 of this year. Seeing how our modern solution offered superior agility, customization for CX flows and administrative functionality. In Q3, they decided to standardize their customer-facing sales support on the Zoom stack and add Workforce Management, leading to a nearly 5 times increase in their monthly spend with us. I\u2019d also like to congratulate the Virgin Group on their launch of Workvivo to bring together 60,000 employees across almost 40 Virgin companies on one platform. The Virgin Family Workvivo platform is helping to drive social connection, encourage collaboration and boost brand knowledge. It\u2019s inspiring to see how the Virgin Group is bringing the platform to life and strengthening culture with Zoom\u2019s Workvivo. These wins are a testament to the investments we are making in our customer experience offering, with the rapid pace of new innovations like Workforce Management, Quality Management, Zoom Virtual Agent and AI Expert Assist. They also highlight our progress with employee experience, especially with integrating Workvivo into the Zoom client. Thank you so much to Dropbox, Amynta and Virgin Group. I love you all. And with that I\u2019ll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric and hello, everyone. We are pleased that we beat our top-line and profitability guidance in Q3. Here are a few milestones: First, Zoom Phone reached approximately 7 million paid seats. Second, Zoom Contact Center reached approximately 700 customers as of quarter-end, while Zoom Virtual Agent customers nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter. And finally, the number of customers on Zoom One bundles that include Zoom Phone grew approximately 330% year-over-year. These proof points demonstrate our customers\u2019 willingness to entrust us with their critical CX and EX processes, and their commitment to grow with us as we expand our platform. In Q3, total revenue came in at $1.137 billion, up 3% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. This result was approximately $17 million above the high end of our guidance. Our Enterprise business grew 8% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue, up from 56% a year ago. We continued to see improvement in Online Average Monthly Churn, which decreased to 3.0% from 3.1% in Q3 of FY \u201823. This is the lowest churn we have ever reported. The number of Enterprise customers grew 5% year-over-year to approximately 219,700. Our trailing 12 month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q3 came in at 105%. We saw 14% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 3,731 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 29% of revenue, up from 27% in Q3 of FY \u201823. Our Americas revenue grew 5% year-over-year, while EMEA, APAC declined by 2%, each. On a constant currency basis, APAC grew slightly year-over-year Moving to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on strategic investments, and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 79.7%, an improvement from 79.5% in Q3 of last year, but slightly lower than the first half of this year. The strong performance in gross margin was primarily driven by the optimization of usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers, partially offset by our additional investments in new AI technologies. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 80%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 17% to $447 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $405 million. This translates to a 39.3% non-GAAP operating margin, a meaningful improvement from 34.6% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.29, on approximately 310 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.20 above the high end of our guidance and $0.22 higher in Q3 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.32 billion, down approximately 3% from Q3 of last year. This was roughly 1 percentage point better than the high end of the guidance we provided last quarter. For Q4, we expect deferred revenue to be down 6$ to 8% year-over-year, partially driven by shorter billing frequencies on Enterprise deals arising from the high interest rate environment. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO increased 10% year-over-year to approximately $3.6 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 58% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 59% in Q3 of last year, indicating lengthening contract durations on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, our renewal seasonality peaks in Q1 and declines throughout the rest of the year. Operating cash flow in the quarter grew 67% year-over-year to $493 million. Free cash flow grew 66% year-over-year to $453 million. The sharp increase in our cash flow metrics was due to stronger collections, targeted expense management and higher interest income. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow margins expanded to 43.4% and 39.9%, respectively. Turning to guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.13 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 1% year-over-year growth. Adjusting for currency impact, this projection is slightly higher than the previously implied guidance from our Q2 call. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $409 million to $414 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.13 to $1.15 based on approximately 312 million shares outstanding. We are also pleased to raise our top-line and profitability outlook for the full year of FY \u201824. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.506 billion to $4.511 billion, which at the midpoint represents approximately 3% year-over-year growth. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.745 billion representing an operating margin of approximately 39%. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share for FY \u201824 is $4.93 to $4.95, based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors for your trust and support. Kelcey, please queue up the first question.\nOperator: Thank you, Kelly. And as Kelly mentioned, we will now move into the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays.\nRyan MacWilliams: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just to start with Kelly, do you have any changes in the overall macro environment in the third quarter compared to the second quarter? And could you touch on how linearity did throughout the quarter for new bookings? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. Hi, Ryan. So the macro has been pretty consistent from Q2 to Q3. We continue to see similar trends in terms of deal scrutiny, back-end loaded. So the quarter from a direct perspective was fairly back-end loaded. As a reminder, the online segment of the business is typically pretty linear throughout the quarter. I think the only thing that got a little worse from Q2 to Q3 was actually FX, as you saw in Asia Pac that had \u2013 that was a fairly significant headwind for us, whereas Asia Pac would have at least been flat year-over-year, if not for that impact.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks guys.\nOperator: Moving on to Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks. Maybe just a question on kind of what feedback you're getting on the AI companion and that's a pretty big jump in kind of customers using it. So just what features are they really liking -- and is it kind of helping with some of the free-to-pay conversion that you guys were hoping for? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Yes. It's a great question. I think we are very, very proud of our team's progress since it launched the Zoom AI Companion, as I mentioned earlier, right, a lot of accounts enabled that. Remember, this is no additional cost to paying customers, a lot of features -- one feature of that is like take a meeting summary, for example. Amazingly, it's very accurate and really save the meeting host a lot of time. And also, our federated AI approach really contributed to that success because we do not count on a single AI model and in terms of latency, accuracy and also the response, the speed and so on and so forth, I think, really helped our AI combining. Again, and for the online producers and also its additional cost. For sure, for free users, they do not -- they cannot enjoy this combining, for sure, it's a daily health for those who free to approve for online operate. So anyway, so we keep innovating on AI company. We have high confidence. That's a true differentiation compared to any other AI features, functionalities offered by some of our competitors.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks so much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question on Kasthuri Rangan with Goldman Sachs.\nKasthuri Rangan: Hi. Thank you very much. Happy to see the results, and happy Thanksgiving. I just had one question, if I could restrict myself to one. The SMB online churn 3% I don\u2019t know it came down from 3.1%. Any initiatives that you are undertaking that could bring that number even down more significantly I would resume that, that would have big implications for your growth rate and margins, which are already quite good. Thank you so much.\nKelly Steckelberg: Well, Wendy and her team are always working on initiatives. But I think what Eric was just mentioning about AI is probably really going to be a key differentiator and a retention -- retention tool in the future because as a reminder, all of the AI companion features come included for our three -- sorry, for our paid users. So we're seeing it not only help with conversion, but we really believe that for the long term, it will help with retention as well. And cash, I've gotten this question many times, and I would say like, this is the lowest we've ever seen, but also our platform is so much better. It's infinitely better than where it was on a pre-pandemic basis for our online users. And so I think we will -- this is how we're modeling it at this level. But I think over time, you should continue to see retention just continue to improve.\nKasthuri Rangan: Thank you so much.\nEric Yuan: Let me add on to what Kelly said, also the happy Thanksgiving to you as well. So more and more customers realize, wow, Zoom even for online users, it's not only for Zoom Meeting. A lot of other features, right? And I take a Zoom Team chatter for example, this is a great position and it had a solution. It's part of offering, even for free users as well, right? For the paid user for sure, a lot of other features, the more they spend time on Zoom platform, really as well. This is pretty powerful, not only just for meetings but the entire platform.\nKasthuri Rangan: Got it. Thanks so much, Eric and Kelly.\nEric Yuan: Yeah.\nOperator: Wells Fargo is Michael Turrin. Please go ahead with your question.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, great. Thanks. Nice to see everyone. I guess as a complement to Kash's question, you're showing stabilization here on some of the major metrics, the enterprise expand metric took a step down to 105%. And so just wondering what it takes for that metric to similarly show stabilization as given in Q1 renewal cohort and kind of walking through that. Anything on the product side for us to consider or just any other commentary there is helpful. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Well, as a reminder, it's a trailing 12-month metric. So as we've worsely seen our growth rates come down this year that's following behind it. But absolutely, we believe that AI Companion in general as well as the success that we are seeing in Zoom Phone, in Zoom Contact Center, Zoom Virtual Agent, all of those will be key contributors to seeing that metric start to reaccelerate again as we see our growth rate starting to decelerate as well.\nMichael Turrin: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Michael Funk with Bank of America.\nMichael Funk: Yeah. Hi. Thank you for the questions toning. So just on the deferred revenue guidance for 4Q, Kelly, in the commentary on the macro and the rates affecting that. How should we think about growth rate in calendar year '24 given the decline in deferred revenue and impact on new deals in enterprise?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So I mean what's very interesting, if you look at, right, you see growth in RPO, but you're seeing a decline in deferred revenue, which implies customers while they're committing for long-term agreements, they are preferring to pay in shorter-term increments to keep their cash and take advantage of the interest rate environment. So the other thing, as a reminder, right, we're going to have a big renewal cycle in Q1, and then that's the peak and it's going to come down. And we believe that in FY '24 that we're currently in, we had -- the majority of our customers had some sort of renewal period during FY '24, which means that we believe that we've moved through a lot of our customers that were impacted themselves by a reduction. And we've talked in the past about how our team has been doing a great job of preserving that spend. But to the extent we're helping them right-size or transition from new meetings to say, a Zoom One bundle. We think the majority of our customers, we know the majority of our customers have gone through that renewal period in FY '24. And so that by the time we get into FY '25, hopefully, we're in a little more normalized renewal cycle.\nMichael Funk: Great. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: And moving on to Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Hey. Great. Thank you. Hey, Kelly. The phone business has been a big part of the Zoom growth algorithm lately. So I'm wondering if you could elaborate on how that parties did in the quarter. On the surface, and I know that you round that seat number, but it looks like the sequential phone suggests (ph) that might have been a lot less than the last several quarters. Maybe that's rounding, but I wanted to give you a platform maybe to elaborate about that part of the business.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you. So Q3 cyclically, just as a reminder, Q1 and Q3 cyclically are our lower orders, given that our enterprise reps -- some of our enterprise reps are on six month quarter. So we've historically seen the big Zoom Phone, just add quarters be in Q2 and Q4. What we did see in Q3 was that customers in the upper segments. So customers with greater 10,000 seats grew 9% quarter-over-quarter. So we're seeing a lot of strength in the upper end of Zoom Phone. So really happy to that. I mean that's the largest increase we've had so far this year. And then as a reminder, we haven't always given that metric, honestly at the exact same period. So it's hard a little hard for you to tell exactly how it's trending every single quarter. And as just in the past, we'll continue to update you on future milestones as they make sense.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer has the next question.\nGeorge Iwanyc: All right. Well, thank you for taking my questions. So Kelly, maybe following up on Zoom Phones to give us a bit of extra color on the contact center and the customer traction you're seeing there?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So as we mentioned, we're up to over 700 customers on Zoom Contact Center and we saw our Zoom Virtual Agents product double the number of customers quarter-over-quarter. So really excited there. I mean, maybe Eric can talk about some of the features and functionality, but we're thrilled with the progress that we're making there so far.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So we are extremely excited about our content center opportunity. And it feels like back to a few years ago, when we announced the Zoom Phone, right? Quite often, a lot of people mentioned, wow, you would take you guys many years to get recognized, deployed by large customers and look at what we have today in terms of number of paid user phone (ph). I feel like if we ask well, I think we are going to follow the similar journey and maybe even better because if you look at our content center and modern architecture, extremely stable and plus a lot of AI features and innovation speed. I think whenever a customer really take a Zoom content center seriously, evaluate Zoom contact center. The feedback is very consistent. Wow, I did not realize you guys have a so powerful contact center, it's just amazing, right? I think that there's further boosted our team is confidence double down, triple-down our own contact center. Again, it's modern architecture, very scalable. I also shared quite a few customer cases, right, during this call, and we are very, very excited. A lot of new AI features in virtual agent and workforce management and so on and so forth. And this is something that are very, very exciting.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll know hear from Peter Levine with Evercore.\nPeter Levine: Great. Thanks for taking my question here. Maybe for Kelly, as I look at gross margins, how sustainable is it keeping at these levels? I know AI companion is being given away from as part of the package, I guess, prepaid users. But if you think about the cost to run these models, the margin profile of contact center in phone. How durable is it to kind of sustain these levels? And then second, as you think into next year, you have guided, but what's the best way to think about stock-based comp and dilution as you kind of manage through that?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So in terms of our gross margins, we'll obviously give FY '25 guidance on our call next quarter. But as we are working on our planning, our DevOps team is doing an amazing job of continuing to optimize around the data centers and being very thoughtful about leveraging capacity to its highest and best use and making room for all of this AI innovation. So while we are going to invest, and we're actually -- we're going to invest to the extent that XT and the team really believe that we need to and that for the long term, it's an amazing ROI when you look at what it's going to do for our customers, for our growth and for our retention. But we do expect there's going to be some impact on gross margins. I mean we -- I don't think it's going to be significant because the team will continue to work to operate, the very efficient manner that they do and run our colors that way, but we do expect there's going to be some impact to our gross margin as we move forward. Do you want to add anything, Eric?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So you are right on. Just to echo what Kelly said, led by our CTO, XT and his team our federated AI approach, as I mentioned earlier, really contribute a lot. So for sure, and there's a cost impact, but extremely manageable, right? And our team is really, really, I think I had a very smart architecture. That's why I think in terms of cost, very manageable, but also the quality is pretty good. So and we are keep innovating on that.\nPeter Levine: Thank you both.\nKelly Steckelberg: Peter, regarding stock-based comp, about a third of our expense this year is related to the supplemental grants. So as a reminder, those that best along with how the underlying grants are vesting. So there's a couple more years for that to just start to bleed off, if you will. If you're going to model that out.\nPeter Levine: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: And we will now hear from Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities.\nPatrick Walravens: Great. Thank you. Hi. So Eric, what is your ideal customer profile on the contact center side of the business?\nEric Yuan: That's great question. I think first of all, again, this is based on architecture and AI features. I think [indiscernible] medium-sized because the reason why for very, very large customers, even if our architecture, everything, ever ready, but sometimes they just want to look at, hey, you are still too early, but even product fully ready. That's the reason why sometimes even we do not reach out to them. It's very large, let's say tens of thousands in customers, if they take our certain series. [Technical Difficulty]\nKelly Steckelberg: Is it Eric freeze or did I freeze.\nOperator: I think Eric is -- Okay.\nKelly Steckelberg: Okay. Let me -- sorry for that. Eric, we lost you for a minute there.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. I'm sorry. And so given the new solution is sort of a modern architecture and all the new AI features those, let's say, like 20,000, 10,000 agent customers, if they look at our solutions, they have confidence. Because of that, we want to be a little bit of practice to focus on medium-sized companies, like form of hundreds agent to thousands of agents. That's our obviously a sweet spot. But not me, I'm going to stop here, as I mentioned earlier, any when, very big large companies, when you look at our contact center solution seriously, we have a confidence about to win. But however, to get there, they focused on the medium-sized companies.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Thank you, Eric.\nKelly Steckelberg: All right. I could give you an example, Patrick. We have a customer called Venture, which provides like payroll and HR services. And they became in the last year, they doubled their Zoom Phone seats. They've doubled their contact center our seats into four digits now. They also have deployed workforce management as well as quality management and ZVA (ph). So really taking advantage of the whole suite Zoom products, not only the contact center and its extensions, but the full suite of Zoom. And I think when they start to deploy like that, they really see the power, and it's been very exciting to see them grow.\nPatrick Walravens: Okay. Thank you both.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you. Can you just touch on the international business a little bit? It seems like it's certainly trailing the U.S. but what gets that business to turn around? And maybe talk about some of your new growth drivers, how they're faring there with Zoom Phone and contact center? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So Unfortunately, both EMEA and APAC over the last year have been impacted both by currency and then EMEA has been impacted by the general economy and the war there. But in terms of our focus, we have very recently actually added a new European leader and a new leader in Australia and New Zealand. So we\u2019re very excited about the team. And since we did the reorganization earlier this year, those regions have just taken a little bit longer than the U.S. but we\u2019re starting to see that momentum build again and really excited about what they\u2019re going to contribute and watching their success in the future.\nArjun Bhatia: Perfect. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Alex Zukin with Wolfe Research. His video is not on, so he may just be audio only.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Alex. Hey, Alex. Do you want to go ahead.\nUnidentified Participant: This is Ethan Brock (ph) on for Alex. He said he is in [indiscernible] right now. Thank you for taking my question. I just had two quick questions. Just how do we think at what level should we expect or when for the NRR of the enterprise cohort to trough? Just any kind of puts and takes around enterprise revenue in the quarter, right, above your expectations, it grew sequentially. And it was also -- it was probably like RPO, CRPO. CRPO bookings has all accelerated. I guess, is it fair to think that for next year's enterprise growth rate would be above what's implied in the 4Q guide? And just if you can give any more kind of color around the 4Q numbers and kind of what you're expecting in the online churn, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we did see strength in the direct bookings, they were very back-end loaded in Q3, which just continues the theme that we've been talking about in terms of the overall macro. And as we look forward to Q4, we have typically, we have the benefit of having year-end where customers are having their year-end on 12/31 and then we have our year-end on January 31. And of course, we have our six-month quota-carrying reps that are coming to the end of their quoter cycle. So hopefully taking advantage of their accelerators. But we are expecting similar behavior in terms of even if we have a 12/31 sort of bump expecting that to be back-end loaded and then January 31 on as well. In terms of your question around net dollar expanding, we're not going to give -- I mean, we don't guide on that. I expect that given your growth rates have come down a little bit more that there might be a little bit more room for that to come down even further until it starts to stabilize and probably reaccelerate sometime next year.\nUnidentified Participant: Okay. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up. Just on the comment you made in your prepared remarks around the shorter billings duration. I guess, is there just any way to qualitatively think relative to 3Q, if there's any change, just how to think about obviously, people moving to a more different -- shorter payment terms. So just how we think about that in terms of what's implied in the 4Q guide? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. We -- so we commented first time, in seeing this trend was in Q2. If you remember, we also talked about this in our prepared remarks, we saw this happening. And given the interests rates are high, I don't expect it's going to change any time soon. I think -- the good news is from the health of the underlying business, right, customers are committing to longer-term duration contracts, they just are preferring to pay on shorter term. And yet, we obviously had very strong cash flow in the period. So I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something you should be worried about.\nUnidentified Participant: Got it. Thank you very much. Congrats on the next results.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks.\nOperator: And our next question is going to come from Mark Murphy at JPMorgan. Mark will be audio only.\nUnidentified Participant: Hi, guys. This is [indiscernible] on for Mark Murphy. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the quarter. You guys called out the Virgin Group and the launch of Workvivo across 60,000 employees and a number of the workforce-related innovations you've launched recently. Can you just speak to the adoption of those products and what kind of momentum you're seeing on that front? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nEric Yuan: Kelly you go ahead.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. I mean we're really excited about Workvivo. They -- first of all, in terms of operating, they're continuing to run as an operating unit, which -- we're making sure that we support them and their continued momentum, and we've already talked about -- we talked about Dollar General on the last quarter and their amazing adoption. So we're really excited about that team. They -- when they joined us, we said, welcome to the family and gave them an accelerated bookings target, and they are running and achieving against that. So really thrilled to have them and watching that continue to succeed.\nUnidentified Participant: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is going to come from Catharine Trebnick with Rosenblatt.\nCatharine Trebnick: Thanks for taking my question. Nice quarter. Has your appetite for M&A changed at all in the last year? All day long on CNB they kept saying, we're looking for growth, reacceleration of growth. So I'm just wondering if you're looking at the $6.5 billion and your attitude towards M&A? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Thank you, Catharine. M&A is something that we evaluate and think about for as a potential strategy all the time. I have a core dev (ph) team that looks at opportunities on a daily basis. And we have a very strong lens that we look through in terms of evaluating that is, first of all, the technology and what does it bring to our customers. We would always want to make sure that our customers continue to enjoy a really high-quality product like they do with Zoom today. We look at the culture to make sure that it's something that we think work well with Zoom. It's usually a really good indicator success of integrating two companies. And then, of course, we look at the lens of valuation and does it make sense? Is it a price that we are willing to pay. And because we have such a high bar, it honestly has been hard to find companies that we love that makes it through all three of those tests. It doesn\u2019t mean that we wouldn\u2019t love to find someone that did. There are some really great companies out there. And for one reason or the other to date, we just haven\u2019t found the right match, but it doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t. And that is why we have purposely remained retained, I should say, the flexibility of having that cash on our balance sheet so that if we do see something interesting, we\u2019re able to act on it.\nOperator: Moving on to KeyBank of Tom Blakey.\nThomas Blakey: Thank you very much. Good to see you, Eric, and hi, Kelly. Just wondering quickly on the stability that we were talking about a couple of quarters ago in online. It's a pretty impressive that we went back and forth on that a little bit here and very stable. I mean obviously talked about the churn. Can you just maybe update us that on that in terms of should we expect the same type of stability in online into the fiscal 4Q and maybe even similarly into fiscal '25, that would be helpful. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So the team has done a lot of work this year to -- on many fronts around online. First of all, stabilizing retention, which you're seeing the benefits of that today as well as focusing on free-to-pay conversion because it's really important that we're continuing to fill the top of the funnel, and those are things like force brakes. And as Eric mentioned earlier, also being able to procure additional products online, things like whiteboard and scheduler are very well aligned to the strategy of our online buyers. So those are all of the initiatives that went in our team are continuing to focus on. In terms \u2013 I mean, we hold ourselves to a very high standard. We say stabilization. What we really want to see is dollar stabilization quarter-over-quarter. And while it\u2019s very, very close, it\u2019s not quite there. And I expect it will be slightly down, just very, very slightly down again in Q4. But as we\u2019re working on FY \u201825 planning with the team, really looking forward to initiatives that drive stabilization and if not, some growth into FY \u201825.\nThomas Blakey: Very helpful. Thank you, Kelly.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yes. Thank you very much. You guided deferred revenue to decline 6% to 8% in Q4. Do you sort of billing frequencies with enterprise customers. The question I have is what kind of decline would that have been without that billing frequency change? And related to this, you're going to have a big renewal cycle in Q1. So do you expect deferred revenue growth to pick up meaningfully in Q1?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. So as a reminder, the way the deferred revenue trends about the year is it's always the highest in Q1 and then it declines throughout the year. And there's two things that are happening. First of all, Q1 is the largest renewal period. So if the bucket gets filled up, and then that\u2019s getting amortized through the rest of the year. But also the subsequent renewal cycles are lower than Q1. So it\u2019s the inverse of probably every other SaaS company in the world where usually you\u2019re adding higher renewals every single quarter, we are actually adding a lower number \u2013 a lower dollar amount of renewals every single quarter. So as Q1 is getting amortized down, what\u2019s coming into refill at the top of that bucket is coming down every single quarter. And that\u2019s why you have seen for quite a number of years now, typically a sequential decline in deferred revenue quarter-over-quarter.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay. Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: We'll now hear from James Fish with Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hi, guys. Thanks for the questions here. Appreciate all the details around some of the product lines. But building off of a few prior questions with that contact center customer count up to about 700 versus the 500 last quarter. If my math is right, given kind of what you guys have talked about with price points kind of seems like we're nearing $100 million of ARR now or how should we think about that average seat count at this point? And then, Eric, for you, look, it got released and was available this quarter, but how has that workforce engagement solution really gone in terms of penetration with the contact center installed bases, is that acting as sort of a consolidation function underneath for especially that small mid-market. Thanks, guys.\nKelly Steckelberg: Go ahead, first.\nEric Yuan: I think if you look at the contact center, right? So not only just all fast to offer the core kind of contact center of capabilities, we want to offer a full platform, right, including workforce management, right? This is the -- based on modern architecture, not something like, hey, you have on-premise solution for a long time, you just put it into the -- in the cloud, that's not the case. We built it everything from ground up. It's tied to integrated with our core contact center solutions. That's the reason why when you look at our customers right from SMB, minimum size, all the way to lot enterprise, I think we are ready. And however, as I mentioned earlier, sweet spotters should be the major, right. However, one thing is realized, customers do have one seamless experience for everything contact center and workforce management, virtual agent AI feature call, engine, right, so we are trying to offer all of them. So that's kind of our strategy. In terms of our workforce management contribution, it really helped because we tell them, hey, we offer everything to you. We are not going to let you deploy other third-party workforce management solutions. We offer all the services, all the functionality to you with one platform.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. And James, in terms of your ability to kind of understand how those products are progressing themselves, we'll do done with others and announced milestone metrics as we start to see them emerge. They're just so new right now that doesn't really sense, but we will do that over time.\nJames Fish: All right. Thanks, Kelly. Thanks, Eric.\nA \u2013 Kelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nA \u2013 Eric Yuan: We are not ready to share with the number, exact number yet about how many customers deploy the workforce management, so we\u2019ll state in the future quarters.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Matt VanVliet fleet with BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess following up one more on sort of the contact center and Zoom Phone. In terms of overall customer mix, you're well below 1% penetration on contact center here. Is there a target that you think is sort of the next few years of the customers you're going to go after? How high do you think of roughly 200,000 customers you have an existing contact center that you've maybe identified and comparably work your way into. And then sort of following up on that, what percentage, if you can share the over 100,000 customers, 100,000 revenue customers have Zoom Phone or Zoom Contact Center as an attachment there?\nKelly Steckelberg: So I guess the way that I think about contact center and its progress is that it's so far is very, pulling in a very similar road map, if you will, than that Zoom Phone did. So if you think about -- we can see the visibility internally just as we could with Zoom Phone. But in terms of ARR as a metric for example, it's going to take a little while for that to be something that's visible to you. But so far, it's tracking in a very, very similar way that's Zoom Phone did, which I think is very encouraging. And that we need a couple more years and then it starts to be a really significant growth contributor. It just start small and then grow quickly, and that's what we're seeing.\nEric Yuan: And also, if you look at opportunity, very similar as well. Many years ago, a lot of our enterprise customers, their phone you see deployment is still on-prem. Today, you look at most of our enterprise customer contact center still on track. So that\u2019s why a lot of opportunity ahead of us, in particular, in our model architecture is very scalable.\nMatthew VanVliet: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Needham\u2019s, Ryan Koontz has the next question. Ryan, please go ahead.\nRyan Koontz: Hi. Happy Thanksgiving. From Zoomtopia, we're really impressed with the Zoom Rooms and what you're doing there. The innovation really seems years ahead of the market. And I wondered how you -- what's your updated view on the rooms opportunity for the company. Do you think it's strong enough that you can use that as a lead as almost a stand-alone product? And you see the market opportunity more promising for you with that product. You have to go to market in those sort of questions. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: So you're right. So speaking of the opportunity, you're also right. We never, customer, for many year, they right deployed the Zoom Rooms for more and more customers. I mean they try to invest hybrid work. They need to have a modern solution for their conf-rooms, they are multiple solutions, Zoom Rooms indeed stands out is indeed years ahead of any other competitors. However, sometimes for customers when they try to support a hybrid work right now, they're in the middle of embracing hybrid work, right? What\u2019s the new layout of the entire workplace and how many conf-room they needed to support and so on and so forth, right? That's why a lot of opportunities. At the same time, when guys work together with customers and not only for conf-room innovation, but also entire workplace, the management, what's the new layout [indiscernible]. I think a lot of opportunity, not only for conf-room itself, like how to reserve a desk, right? All those things we all build in as a part of the Zoom Room, like an example, like a digital signage and also part of Zoom Rooms as the full as the conf-room or workplace solution, and that\u2019s why we needed to make sure a focus on marketing side to share with the customer. Again, Zoom Rooms is not only just for your conf-room solution, but it\u2019s for hybrid work and also for entire workplace as well.\nRyan Koontz: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Ryan.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks, Ryan.\nOperator: Now we'll move on to Peter Weed with Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. I think for the first time, at least as far as I can look at in the model, it looks like the kind of large enterprise was greater than $100,000 enterprise customers were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter. But we're hearing the great stories about customer expansions and the number of those customers has continued to increase, which would imply there's a whole another set of customers that are either shrinking or churning and it appears that got more pronounced this quarter than perhaps we've seen recently. How should we think about those effects, and is that more churn or is it downgrades? And when customers are churning or downgrading, where they're going? And is this something that is kind of temporary and you see it kind of ending? Or is it something where we may have some pain for a bit of time before we get through some effects?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So I think we've talked about this the last couple of quarters. We certainly have seen impact in our customers having retraction in their own businesses in their own employee count. So we -- if that's the situation that we are working with them, we -- the good news is we've not seen a lot of logo churn. It has been more down selling in terms of rightsizing, their meeting license numbers. And yet even in that situation, our team is doing a great job of taking the opportunity to transition them from potentially meetings to one of our Zoom One bundles that include Zoom Phone. We talked about in our prepared remarks, we saw that grow over 300% year-over-year in terms of the number of customers that are using those bundles and that's great for many reasons, right, in terms of retention and having more than one product deployed, we see as very advantageous to customer retention. So we certainly have worked with many, many, many of our customers this year on ensuring that they have the right package in place. And -- but I also talked about earlier this earlier on the call, that we know that the majority of our customers have had some sort of renewal period in FY '24, meaning that we hope, we anticipate that as we've got -- get through the end of this year, we've moved through most of those transitions where organizations have done their own reductions and are aligning their licenses to that.\nPeter Weed: But it sounds like you're not seeing an uptick in churn. This is mostly just that kind of reduction in force. And once we do that, then you set a four in so that the expansions can kind of work going forward on all the great things people are buying, which even us at -- great customers love the product.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah, I mean that, we're not giving FY '25 guidance, just to be clear. But yes, that's in general what we anticipate, just knowing that we've worked through most of our customer renewals this year, and I assume that they've gotten through their reductions. Now it depends on what has overall with the macro, but that's what we leave to be the case. Yes.\nPeter Weed: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Imtiaz Koujalgi with Wedbush.\nKelly Steckelberg: You are on mute.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Sorry, can you guys hear me now?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: A question on Zoom Phone. So Kelly, you give us the ARR last quarter, we have the Zoom Phone seat this quarter. Further, if I do a rough math on the ASP, it comes down to like $7 to $8 something per month, which seems like almost half or even more of the list price. If you can just confirm that and has that come gone down or gone up?\nKelly Steckelberg: So as a reminder, you can buy Zoom Phone either for $10 per license per month if you have metered calling on top or $15, if you get unlimited long distance. So the ASP is going to depend on which version of that, which of the SKU the customers are buying and how they come together. And then, if you think about some of our largest enterprise customers, we do discount not just for obviously, for Zoom Phone, but the overall value of their purchases or their value of being a customer for longevity in terms of length of cycles, willingness to pay upfront. So all of those things contribute, but it sounds like you're right in. You're right in sort of the ballpark. We have not seen a dramatic shift in those discounts up or down.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: And just one follow-up. Is that similar to what you're seeing in the contact center or versus your I think the list price was 70 for contact center. Any comment on how the discounting in contact center compares to what you've seen in Zoom Phone?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. No. I don't think if you can correlate them. They're very different products with different sales cycle and approach. So I don't think I can try to take a percentage discount necessarily from one product and expected to apply to a different one.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nOperator: We will now hear from Tyler Radke with Citi.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Tyler.\nTyler Radke: Yeah. Hi. Good evening. So Kelly, if I look at the midpoint of your guidance for Q4, it's about 1% growth in others. Some currency in there. But how should we be thinking about that as a jumping off point for fiscal year '25? What are kind of the puts and takes that would cause growth to be higher than that, and also lower. It does sound like you're starting to see some stabilization in parts of the business. But just help us frame for how we should be thinking about that trajectory beyond Q4.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we will obviously give FY \u201825 guidance on the Q4 call. However, I do think that the Q4 implied extra rate and considerations around the macro? And if it is stabilizing or improving over time are important considerations. We do see -- we\u2019ve talked about many great aspects of our business today, growth in Zoom Phone, growth in contact center, stabilization and all online, all could be contributors that could drive growth in FY \u201825 to be slightly higher than the implied Q4 exit rate. But right now, I mean, if you look at the extra rate consider the macro and take all that into account as you\u2019re modeling.\nTyler Radke: Thank you.\nOperator: We'll move on to William Power with Baird.\nWilliam Power: Great. Thanks. Maybe a couple of quick follow-ups. I guess, Eric, to an earlier question on AI companion, can you just talk about where you're seeing the greatest usage. I mean what are customers most focused on? And what's the early feedback look like? And what are customers asking for in AI? Where can you continue to add more value there?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. It's a great question. First of all, AI combining includes a lot of features. Like if you are related to the call, you want to instead of what's going on, what kind of the point I missed, and so you can ask, right, all those kind of features. And also when you use our team chat, you can have a composer chat solution and a lot of features built upon that, right? So -- and one of the key features customer-like is very for sure Zoom Meeting summary, right? And after meeting Zoom, not only to be generated. Sometimes, record meeting or some -- for now you don\u2019t know recorded meeting anymore. It just recorded a summary. And that future works extremely well. We do see among a lot of other features, customers already started in a blink. I think this one is probably one of the highlights. It is very easy to use and you see the very adverse in our way to enable that feature. So again, it's a lot of other features as well. And like for me, I also use our -- the client, the Zoom Client, connect and other services you can, right? You can have -- you compose e-mail as well, right? It's a lot of features, right? And down the road awareness for the whiteboard with AI companion as well. Almost every service entire platform, we're going to lever the AI combined. So and a lot of features and the AI Companion.\nWilliam Power: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: You enable meeting summary and explore so many features, I'm pretty sure you'll love that. So we've got a lot of very positive feedback from those early adopter.\nOperator: And our last question is going to come from Stephen Bersey with HSBC. Steven, if you want to go ahead -- I believe, Stephen, just disconnected. Stephen, are you still out there? If you are not, I don't think he's -- no longer with us. So what, Eric, I'll just turn out to you for closing remarks.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So first of all, thank you all for your time to join our Q3 earnings call, I really appreciate wish you all and your families have a wonderful holiday season. Thank you again for your great support. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you so much, Eric. I apologize, Kelly. Again, everyone, this concludes today's earnings release. As Eric and Kelly mentioned, we thank you all for your participation and from our family to yours. May you and yours have a safe and happy holiday season. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric and hello, everyone. We are pleased that we beat our top-line and profitability guidance in Q3. Here are a few milestones: First, Zoom Phone reached approximately 7 million paid seats. Second, Zoom Contact Center reached approximately 700 customers as of quarter-end, while Zoom Virtual Agent customers nearly doubled quarter-over-quarter. And finally, the number of customers on Zoom One bundles that include Zoom Phone grew approximately 330% year-over-year. These proof points demonstrate our customers' willingness to entrust us with their critical CX and EX processes, and their commitment to grow with us as we expand our platform. In Q3, total revenue came in at $1.137 billion, up 3% year-over-year and 4% in constant currency. This result was approximately $17 million above the high end of our guidance. Our Enterprise business grew 8% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue, up from 56% a year ago. We continued to see improvement in Online Average Monthly Churn, which decreased to 3.0% from 3.1% in Q3 of FY \u201823. This is the lowest churn we have ever reported. The number of Enterprise customers grew 5% year-over-year to approximately 219,700. Our trailing 12 month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q3 came in at 105%. We saw 14% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 3,731 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 29% of revenue, up from 27% in Q3 of FY \u201823. Our Americas revenue grew 5% year-over-year, while EMEA, APAC declined by 2%, each. On a constant currency basis, APAC grew slightly year-over-year Moving to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on strategic investments, and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 was 79.7%, an improvement from 79.5% in Q3 of last year, but slightly lower than the first half of this year. The strong performance in gross margin was primarily driven by the optimization of usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers, partially offset by our additional investments in new AI technologies. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 80%. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 17% to $447 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $405 million. This translates to a 39.3% non-GAAP operating margin, a meaningful improvement from 34.6% in Q3 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q3 was $1.29, on approximately 310 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.20 above the high end of our guidance and $0.22 higher in Q3 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.32 billion, down approximately 3% from Q3 of last year. This was roughly 1 percentage point better than the high end of the guidance we provided last quarter. For Q4, we expect deferred revenue to be down 6$ to 8% year-over-year, partially driven by shorter billing frequencies on Enterprise deals arising from the high interest rate environment. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO increased 10% year-over-year to approximately $3.6 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 58% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 59% in Q3 of last year, indicating lengthening contract durations on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, our renewal seasonality peaks in Q1 and declines throughout the rest of the year. Operating cash flow in the quarter grew 67% year-over-year to $493 million. Free cash flow grew 66% year-over-year to $453 million. The sharp increase in our cash flow metrics was due to stronger collections, targeted expense management and higher interest income. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow margins expanded to 43.4% and 39.9%, respectively. Turning to guidance. For Q4, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.125 billion to $1.13 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 1% year-over-year growth. Adjusting for currency impact, this projection is slightly higher than the previously implied guidance from our Q2 call. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $409 million to $414 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.13 to $1.15 based on approximately 312 million shares outstanding. We are also pleased to raise our top-line and profitability outlook for the full year of FY \u201824. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.506 billion to $4.511 billion, which at the midpoint represents approximately 3% year-over-year growth. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.74 billion to $1.745 billion representing an operating margin of approximately 39%. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share for FY \u201824 is $4.93 to $4.95, based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors for your trust and support. Kelcey, please queue up the first question. Yeah. Hi, Ryan. So the macro has been pretty consistent from Q2 to Q3. We continue to see similar trends in terms of deal scrutiny, back-end loaded. So the quarter from a direct perspective was fairly back-end loaded. As a reminder, the online segment of the business is typically pretty linear throughout the quarter. I think the only thing that got a little worse from Q2 to Q3 was actually FX, as you saw in Asia Pac that had \u2013 that was a fairly significant headwind for us, whereas Asia Pac would have at least been flat year-over-year, if not for that impact. Well, Wendy and her team are always working on initiatives. But I think what Eric was just mentioning about AI is probably really going to be a key differentiator and a retention -- retention tool in the future because as a reminder, all of the AI companion features come included for our three -- sorry, for our paid users. So we're seeing it not only help with conversion, but we really believe that for the long term, it will help with retention as well. And cash, I've gotten this question many times, and I would say like, this is the lowest we've ever seen, but also our platform is so much better. It's infinitely better than where it was on a pre-pandemic basis for our online users. And so I think we will -- this is how we're modeling it at this level. But I think over time, you should continue to see retention just continue to improve. Well, as a reminder, it's a trailing 12-month metric. So as we've worsely seen our growth rates come down this year that's following behind it. But absolutely, we believe that AI Companion in general as well as the success that we are seeing in Zoom Phone, in Zoom Contact Center, Zoom Virtual Agent, all of those will be key contributors to seeing that metric start to reaccelerate again as we see our growth rate starting to decelerate as well. Yeah. So I mean what's very interesting, if you look at, right, you see growth in RPO, but you're seeing a decline in deferred revenue, which implies customers while they're committing for long-term agreements, they are preferring to pay in shorter-term increments to keep their cash and take advantage of the interest rate environment. So the other thing, as a reminder, right, we're going to have a big renewal cycle in Q1, and then that's the peak and it's going to come down. And we believe that in FY '24 that we're currently in, we had -- the majority of our customers had some sort of renewal period during FY '24, which means that we believe that we've moved through a lot of our customers that were impacted themselves by a reduction. And we've talked in the past about how our team has been doing a great job of preserving that spend. But to the extent we're helping them right-size or transition from new meetings to say, a Zoom One bundle. We think the majority of our customers, we know the majority of our customers have gone through that renewal period in FY '24. And so that by the time we get into FY '25, hopefully, we're in a little more normalized renewal cycle. Yeah. Thank you. So Q3 cyclically, just as a reminder, Q1 and Q3 cyclically are our lower orders, given that our enterprise reps -- some of our enterprise reps are on six month quarter. So we've historically seen the big Zoom Phone, just add quarters be in Q2 and Q4. What we did see in Q3 was that customers in the upper segments. So customers with greater 10,000 seats grew 9% quarter-over-quarter. So we're seeing a lot of strength in the upper end of Zoom Phone. So really happy to that. I mean that's the largest increase we've had so far this year. And then as a reminder, we haven't always given that metric, honestly at the exact same period. So it's hard a little hard for you to tell exactly how it's trending every single quarter. And as just in the past, we'll continue to update you on future milestones as they make sense. Yeah. So as we mentioned, we're up to over 700 customers on Zoom Contact Center and we saw our Zoom Virtual Agents product double the number of customers quarter-over-quarter. So really excited there. I mean, maybe Eric can talk about some of the features and functionality, but we're thrilled with the progress that we're making there so far. Yes. So in terms of our gross margins, we'll obviously give FY '25 guidance on our call next quarter. But as we are working on our planning, our DevOps team is doing an amazing job of continuing to optimize around the data centers and being very thoughtful about leveraging capacity to its highest and best use and making room for all of this AI innovation. So while we are going to invest, and we're actually -- we're going to invest to the extent that XT and the team really believe that we need to and that for the long term, it's an amazing ROI when you look at what it's going to do for our customers, for our growth and for our retention. But we do expect there's going to be some impact on gross margins. I mean we -- I don't think it's going to be significant because the team will continue to work to operate, the very efficient manner that they do and run our colors that way, but we do expect there's going to be some impact to our gross margin as we move forward. Do you want to add anything, Eric? Peter, regarding stock-based comp, about a third of our expense this year is related to the supplemental grants. So as a reminder, those that best along with how the underlying grants are vesting. So there's a couple more years for that to just start to bleed off, if you will. If you're going to model that out. Yeah. Is it Eric freeze or did I freeze. Okay. Let me -- sorry for that. Eric, we lost you for a minute there. All right. I could give you an example, Patrick. We have a customer called Venture, which provides like payroll and HR services. And they became in the last year, they doubled their Zoom Phone seats. They've doubled their contact center our seats into four digits now. They also have deployed workforce management as well as quality management and ZVA (ph). So really taking advantage of the whole suite Zoom products, not only the contact center and its extensions, but the full suite of Zoom. And I think when they start to deploy like that, they really see the power, and it's been very exciting to see them grow. Yeah. So Unfortunately, both EMEA and APAC over the last year have been impacted both by currency and then EMEA has been impacted by the general economy and the war there. But in terms of our focus, we have very recently actually added a new European leader and a new leader in Australia and New Zealand. So we're very excited about the team. And since we did the reorganization earlier this year, those regions have just taken a little bit longer than the U.S. but we're starting to see that momentum build again and really excited about what they're going to contribute and watching their success in the future. Yeah. Hi, Alex. Hey, Alex. Do you want to go ahead. Yeah. So we did see strength in the direct bookings, they were very back-end loaded in Q3, which just continues the theme that we've been talking about in terms of the overall macro. And as we look forward to Q4, we have typically, we have the benefit of having year-end where customers are having their year-end on 12/31 and then we have our year-end on January 31. And of course, we have our six-month quota-carrying reps that are coming to the end of their quoter cycle. So hopefully taking advantage of their accelerators. But we are expecting similar behavior in terms of even if we have a 12/31 sort of bump expecting that to be back-end loaded and then January 31 on as well. In terms of your question around net dollar expanding, we're not going to give -- I mean, we don't guide on that. I expect that given your growth rates have come down a little bit more that there might be a little bit more room for that to come down even further until it starts to stabilize and probably reaccelerate sometime next year. Yeah. We -- so we commented first time, in seeing this trend was in Q2. If you remember, we also talked about this in our prepared remarks, we saw this happening. And given the interests rates are high, I don't expect it's going to change any time soon. I think -- the good news is from the health of the underlying business, right, customers are committing to longer-term duration contracts, they just are preferring to pay on shorter term. And yet, we obviously had very strong cash flow in the period. So I don't think it's something you should be worried about. Thanks. Yeah. Yeah. I mean we're really excited about Workvivo. They -- first of all, in terms of operating, they're continuing to run as an operating unit, which -- we're making sure that we support them and their continued momentum, and we've already talked about -- we talked about Dollar General on the last quarter and their amazing adoption. So we're really excited about that team. They -- when they joined us, we said, welcome to the family and gave them an accelerated bookings target, and they are running and achieving against that. So really thrilled to have them and watching that continue to succeed. Yes. Thank you, Catharine. M&A is something that we evaluate and think about for as a potential strategy all the time. I have a core dev (ph) team that looks at opportunities on a daily basis. And we have a very strong lens that we look through in terms of evaluating that is, first of all, the technology and what does it bring to our customers. We would always want to make sure that our customers continue to enjoy a really high-quality product like they do with Zoom today. We look at the culture to make sure that it's something that we think work well with Zoom. It's usually a really good indicator success of integrating two companies. And then, of course, we look at the lens of valuation and does it make sense? Is it a price that we are willing to pay. And because we have such a high bar, it honestly has been hard to find companies that we love that makes it through all three of those tests. It doesn't mean that we wouldn't love to find someone that did. There are some really great companies out there. And for one reason or the other to date, we just haven't found the right match, but it doesn't mean that we won't. And that is why we have purposely remained retained, I should say, the flexibility of having that cash on our balance sheet so that if we do see something interesting, we're able to act on it. Yeah. So the team has done a lot of work this year to -- on many fronts around online. First of all, stabilizing retention, which you're seeing the benefits of that today as well as focusing on free-to-pay conversion because it's really important that we're continuing to fill the top of the funnel, and those are things like force brakes. And as Eric mentioned earlier, also being able to procure additional products online, things like whiteboard and scheduler are very well aligned to the strategy of our online buyers. So those are all of the initiatives that went in our team are continuing to focus on. In terms \u2013 I mean, we hold ourselves to a very high standard. We say stabilization. What we really want to see is dollar stabilization quarter-over-quarter. And while it's very, very close, it's not quite there. And I expect it will be slightly down, just very, very slightly down again in Q4. But as we're working on FY \u201825 planning with the team, really looking forward to initiatives that drive stabilization and if not, some growth into FY \u201825. Yeah. Yes. So as a reminder, the way the deferred revenue trends about the year is it's always the highest in Q1 and then it declines throughout the year. And there's two things that are happening. First of all, Q1 is the largest renewal period. So if the bucket gets filled up, and then that's getting amortized through the rest of the year. But also the subsequent renewal cycles are lower than Q1. So it's the inverse of probably every other SaaS company in the world where usually you're adding higher renewals every single quarter, we are actually adding a lower number \u2013 a lower dollar amount of renewals every single quarter. So as Q1 is getting amortized down, what's coming into refill at the top of that bucket is coming down every single quarter. And that's why you have seen for quite a number of years now, typically a sequential decline in deferred revenue quarter-over-quarter. Yeah. Go ahead, first. Yeah. And James, in terms of your ability to kind of understand how those products are progressing themselves, we'll do done with others and announced milestone metrics as we start to see them emerge. They're just so new right now that doesn't really sense, but we will do that over time. So I guess the way that I think about contact center and its progress is that it's so far is very, pulling in a very similar road map, if you will, than that Zoom Phone did. So if you think about -- we can see the visibility internally just as we could with Zoom Phone. But in terms of ARR as a metric for example, it's going to take a little while for that to be something that's visible to you. But so far, it's tracking in a very, very similar way that's Zoom Phone did, which I think is very encouraging. And that we need a couple more years and then it starts to be a really significant growth contributor. It just start small and then grow quickly, and that's what we're seeing. Thanks, Ryan. Yeah. So I think we've talked about this the last couple of quarters. We certainly have seen impact in our customers having retraction in their own businesses in their own employee count. So we -- if that's the situation that we are working with them, we -- the good news is we've not seen a lot of logo churn. It has been more down selling in terms of rightsizing, their meeting license numbers. And yet even in that situation, our team is doing a great job of taking the opportunity to transition them from potentially meetings to one of our Zoom One bundles that include Zoom Phone. We talked about in our prepared remarks, we saw that grow over 300% year-over-year in terms of the number of customers that are using those bundles and that's great for many reasons, right, in terms of retention and having more than one product deployed, we see as very advantageous to customer retention. So we certainly have worked with many, many, many of our customers this year on ensuring that they have the right package in place. And -- but I also talked about earlier this earlier on the call, that we know that the majority of our customers have had some sort of renewal period in FY '24, meaning that we hope, we anticipate that as we've got -- get through the end of this year, we've moved through most of those transitions where organizations have done their own reductions and are aligning their licenses to that. Yeah, I mean that, we're not giving FY '25 guidance, just to be clear. But yes, that's in general what we anticipate, just knowing that we've worked through most of our customer renewals this year, and I assume that they've gotten through their reductions. Now it depends on what has overall with the macro, but that's what we leave to be the case. Yes. Yes. You are on mute. Yeah. So as a reminder, you can buy Zoom Phone either for $10 per license per month if you have metered calling on top or $15, if you get unlimited long distance. So the ASP is going to depend on which version of that, which of the SKU the customers are buying and how they come together. And then, if you think about some of our largest enterprise customers, we do discount not just for obviously, for Zoom Phone, but the overall value of their purchases or their value of being a customer for longevity in terms of length of cycles, willingness to pay upfront. So all of those things contribute, but it sounds like you're right in. You're right in sort of the ballpark. We have not seen a dramatic shift in those discounts up or down. Yeah. No. I don't think if you can correlate them. They're very different products with different sales cycle and approach. So I don't think I can try to take a percentage discount necessarily from one product and expected to apply to a different one. Yeah. Hi, Tyler. Yeah. So we will obviously give FY \u201825 guidance on the Q4 call. However, I do think that the Q4 implied extra rate and considerations around the macro? And if it is stabilizing or improving over time are important considerations. We do see -- we've talked about many great aspects of our business today, growth in Zoom Phone, growth in contact center, stabilization and all online, all could be contributors that could drive growth in FY \u201825 to be slightly higher than the implied Q4 exit rate. But right now, I mean, if you look at the extra rate consider the macro and take all that into account as you're modeling."

            "name": "Eric Yuan",
            "content": "Hey. Thank you, Tom. Thank you everyone for joining us today. In early October, we hosted Zoomtopia, our yearly customer and innovation-focused event, and it was awesome. Like last year, we ran it hybrid on Zoom Events, thousands joined us in person and many multiples of that virtually. Among the in person attendees were 40 customer presenters such as JP Morgan, MIT, Boston Consulting Group, HubSpot and Kohls, who spoke about their amazing experiences on Zoom and excitement about the future. We also showcased newly-released innovations like Zoom AI Companion, as well as Zoom AI Expert Assist and Quality Management for the Contact Center. Zoom AI Companion is especially noteworthy for being included at no additional cost to our paid plans, and has fared tremendously well with over 220,000 accounts enabling it and 2.8 million meeting summaries created as of today. Remarkable growth in less than three months. At Zoomtopia, I also had the pleasure of sharing the stage with Flex, a global manufacturing and supply chain leader, who spoke about how they use Zoom to connect their large, distributed workforce of 170,000 employees across 30 countries. Flex started using Zoom Meetings in 2017, quickly followed by Rooms and Team Chat. Since then, Flex increased Team Chat users by 200% and Zoom Rooms by 245%. They also became power users of Zoom Whiteboard, creating over 13,000 Whiteboards. And moving to Zoom Phone allowed them to eliminate 50 to 70% of circuits and infrastructure across the globe, and reduce total cost of ownership. We were so happy to have Flex share their journey at Zoomtopia, and it cannot wait for what is in store for our partnership next. Now moving on to some of our customer wins in Q3. First, let me thank Dropbox, who has been an amazing customer for many years starting with Meetings and then extending to Rooms, Phone and Events. In Q3, they selected Zoom Virtual Agent and Zoom Contact Center to provide world-class AI-enabled support to their global user base. Let me also thank Amynta Group, a premier insurance services company, who initially adopted Zoom Phone and Zoom Contact Center on a limited scale in Q1 of this year. Seeing how our modern solution offered superior agility, customization for CX flows and administrative functionality. In Q3, they decided to standardize their customer-facing sales support on the Zoom stack and add Workforce Management, leading to a nearly 5 times increase in their monthly spend with us. I'd also like to congratulate the Virgin Group on their launch of Workvivo to bring together 60,000 employees across almost 40 Virgin companies on one platform. The Virgin Family Workvivo platform is helping to drive social connection, encourage collaboration and boost brand knowledge. It's inspiring to see how the Virgin Group is bringing the platform to life and strengthening culture with Zoom's Workvivo. These wins are a testament to the investments we are making in our customer experience offering, with the rapid pace of new innovations like Workforce Management, Quality Management, Zoom Virtual Agent and AI Expert Assist. They also highlight our progress with employee experience, especially with integrating Workvivo into the Zoom client. Thank you so much to Dropbox, Amynta and Virgin Group. I love you all. And with that I'll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you. Yes. It's a great question. I think we are very, very proud of our team's progress since it launched the Zoom AI Companion, as I mentioned earlier, right, a lot of accounts enabled that. Remember, this is no additional cost to paying customers, a lot of features -- one feature of that is like take a meeting summary, for example. Amazingly, it's very accurate and really save the meeting host a lot of time. And also, our federated AI approach really contributed to that success because we do not count on a single AI model and in terms of latency, accuracy and also the response, the speed and so on and so forth, I think, really helped our AI combining. Again, and for the online producers and also its additional cost. For sure, for free users, they do not -- they cannot enjoy this combining, for sure, it's a daily health for those who free to approve for online operate. So anyway, so we keep innovating on AI company. We have high confidence. That's a true differentiation compared to any other AI features, functionalities offered by some of our competitors. Thank you. Let me add on to what Kelly said, also the happy Thanksgiving to you as well. So more and more customers realize, wow, Zoom even for online users, it's not only for Zoom Meeting. A lot of other features, right? And I take a Zoom Team chatter for example, this is a great position and it had a solution. It's part of offering, even for free users as well, right? For the paid user for sure, a lot of other features, the more they spend time on Zoom platform, really as well. This is pretty powerful, not only just for meetings but the entire platform. Yeah. Yeah. So we are extremely excited about our content center opportunity. And it feels like back to a few years ago, when we announced the Zoom Phone, right? Quite often, a lot of people mentioned, wow, you would take you guys many years to get recognized, deployed by large customers and look at what we have today in terms of number of paid user phone (ph). I feel like if we ask well, I think we are going to follow the similar journey and maybe even better because if you look at our content center and modern architecture, extremely stable and plus a lot of AI features and innovation speed. I think whenever a customer really take a Zoom content center seriously, evaluate Zoom contact center. The feedback is very consistent. Wow, I did not realize you guys have a so powerful contact center, it's just amazing, right? I think that there's further boosted our team is confidence double down, triple-down our own contact center. Again, it's modern architecture, very scalable. I also shared quite a few customer cases, right, during this call, and we are very, very excited. A lot of new AI features in virtual agent and workforce management and so on and so forth. And this is something that are very, very exciting. Thank you. Yes. So you are right on. Just to echo what Kelly said, led by our CTO, XT and his team our federated AI approach, as I mentioned earlier, really contribute a lot. So for sure, and there's a cost impact, but extremely manageable, right? And our team is really, really, I think I had a very smart architecture. That's why I think in terms of cost, very manageable, but also the quality is pretty good. So and we are keep innovating on that. That's great question. I think first of all, again, this is based on architecture and AI features. I think [indiscernible] medium-sized because the reason why for very, very large customers, even if our architecture, everything, ever ready, but sometimes they just want to look at, hey, you are still too early, but even product fully ready. That's the reason why sometimes even we do not reach out to them. It's very large, let's say tens of thousands in customers, if they take our certain series. [Technical Difficulty] Yeah. I'm sorry. And so given the new solution is sort of a modern architecture and all the new AI features those, let's say, like 20,000, 10,000 agent customers, if they look at our solutions, they have confidence. Because of that, we want to be a little bit of practice to focus on medium-sized companies, like form of hundreds agent to thousands of agents. That's our obviously a sweet spot. But not me, I'm going to stop here, as I mentioned earlier, any when, very big large companies, when you look at our contact center solution seriously, we have a confidence about to win. But however, to get there, they focused on the medium-sized companies. Thank you. Kelly you go ahead. I think if you look at the contact center, right? So not only just all fast to offer the core kind of contact center of capabilities, we want to offer a full platform, right, including workforce management, right? This is the -- based on modern architecture, not something like, hey, you have on-premise solution for a long time, you just put it into the -- in the cloud, that's not the case. We built it everything from ground up. It's tied to integrated with our core contact center solutions. That's the reason why when you look at our customers right from SMB, minimum size, all the way to lot enterprise, I think we are ready. And however, as I mentioned earlier, sweet spotters should be the major, right. However, one thing is realized, customers do have one seamless experience for everything contact center and workforce management, virtual agent AI feature call, engine, right, so we are trying to offer all of them. So that's kind of our strategy. In terms of our workforce management contribution, it really helped because we tell them, hey, we offer everything to you. We are not going to let you deploy other third-party workforce management solutions. We offer all the services, all the functionality to you with one platform. And also, if you look at opportunity, very similar as well. Many years ago, a lot of our enterprise customers, their phone you see deployment is still on-prem. Today, you look at most of our enterprise customer contact center still on track. So that's why a lot of opportunity ahead of us, in particular, in our model architecture is very scalable. So you're right. So speaking of the opportunity, you're also right. We never, customer, for many year, they right deployed the Zoom Rooms for more and more customers. I mean they try to invest hybrid work. They need to have a modern solution for their conf-rooms, they are multiple solutions, Zoom Rooms indeed stands out is indeed years ahead of any other competitors. However, sometimes for customers when they try to support a hybrid work right now, they're in the middle of embracing hybrid work, right? What's the new layout of the entire workplace and how many conf-room they needed to support and so on and so forth, right? That's why a lot of opportunities. At the same time, when guys work together with customers and not only for conf-room innovation, but also entire workplace, the management, what's the new layout [indiscernible]. I think a lot of opportunity, not only for conf-room itself, like how to reserve a desk, right? All those things we all build in as a part of the Zoom Room, like an example, like a digital signage and also part of Zoom Rooms as the full as the conf-room or workplace solution, and that's why we needed to make sure a focus on marketing side to share with the customer. Again, Zoom Rooms is not only just for your conf-room solution, but it's for hybrid work and also for entire workplace as well. Thank you, Ryan. Yeah. It's a great question. First of all, AI combining includes a lot of features. Like if you are related to the call, you want to instead of what's going on, what kind of the point I missed, and so you can ask, right, all those kind of features. And also when you use our team chat, you can have a composer chat solution and a lot of features built upon that, right? So -- and one of the key features customer-like is very for sure Zoom Meeting summary, right? And after meeting Zoom, not only to be generated. Sometimes, record meeting or some -- for now you don't know recorded meeting anymore. It just recorded a summary. And that future works extremely well. We do see among a lot of other features, customers already started in a blink. I think this one is probably one of the highlights. It is very easy to use and you see the very adverse in our way to enable that feature. So again, it's a lot of other features as well. And like for me, I also use our -- the client, the Zoom Client, connect and other services you can, right? You can have -- you compose e-mail as well, right? It's a lot of features, right? And down the road awareness for the whiteboard with AI companion as well. Almost every service entire platform, we're going to lever the AI combined. So and a lot of features and the AI Companion. You enable meeting summary and explore so many features, I'm pretty sure you'll love that. So we've got a lot of very positive feedback from those early adopter. Yeah. So first of all, thank you all for your time to join our Q3 earnings call, I really appreciate wish you all and your families have a wonderful holiday season. Thank you again for your great support. Thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Okay. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's Q2 FY \u201923 Earnings Release Webinar. As a reminder, today's webinar is being recorded. And now I would like to hand things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations. Tom?\nTom McCallum: Thank you, David. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. I\u2019m joined today by Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, and Zoom\u2019s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.us. Also, on this page you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the third quarter and full fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding financial and business trends; impacts from the macroeconomic environment, our market position, opportunities, go-to-market initiatives, growth strategy and business aspirations; and product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, that we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including the Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we may make on today\u2019s webinar. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Hey. Thank you, Tom. Hey. Thank you everyone for joining us today. So before starting, I\u2019d like to welcome Dr. Xuedong Huang as our CTO, who joins us after a successful career at Microsoft, where he most recently served as Azure AI CTO and Technical Fellow. Dr. XD joins us at an optimal moment in our AI journey. In the past few months, we brought several new AI innovations to the market and announced an aggressive roadmap aimed at empowering our customers to work smarter and serve their customers better. And, as we develop and deploy AI solutions, we strongly believe that technology should advance trust. We are privileged to have countless customers rely on us for their communications needs. We don\u2019t take that for granted. Earlier this month, we took the additional step in stating that Zoom does NOT use customer content to train our AI models or third-party AI models. I\u2019m proud of the approach we are taking. By putting customers\u2019 privacy needs first, Zoom is taking a leadership position in ensuring customers can use our AI features with confidence that their content is protected. Now, let me share how we have advanced in our mission of: One Platform Delivering Limitless Human Connection. We launched Zoom Scheduler, which serves to reduce the hassle of scheduling with people outside your organization, and Intelligent Director, which uses AI and multiple cameras to provide the best image and angle of participants joining from a conference room. We also launched many new offerings like Zoom Clips, which enables asynchronous video conversations. And more and more customers are getting on Zoom Team Chat, driven by increased adoption of Zoom One and new features like Continuous Meeting Chat, which connects the transient in-meeting chat feature to the persistent Zoom Team Chat product. Currently, we have two fortune 15 companies, one major consulting firm, a global F&B brand and a leading law firm using Zoom Team Chat as a core means of text-based communications. Our Contact Center product has surpassed 500 customers and we are rolling out about 90 new features and enhancements per quarter. We launched Workforce Management in early July to help customers streamline customer communications, manage agent needs, and transform their customer experience all from a single, unified platform. WFM is already off to a great start and we look forward to adding additional products to this suite to expand our native customer experience capabilities and revenue streams. We have progressed rapidly in our integration of Workvivo. After rolling it out internally, I could not be more impressed with the product and confident in the value it will bring to our customers in terms of building culture across a distributed workforce, ultimately delivering upon our strategic pillar of enabling hybrid work. Speaking of which, a few weeks ago, we announced internally a structured hybrid approach -- asking our Zoomies that live within commuting distance to come into their local office twice a week. Zoom is purpose-built for hybrid work and it is on us to understand what our customers are experiencing in their hybrid journeys and what works and does not work for them. We believe that this approach will enable us to continue to innovate for our customers and deliver what they need to succeed. Now moving on to some of our customer wins. First, we are excited to expand with the United States Postal Service. In Q2, the postal service added Zoom Team Chat for 21,500 users to their existing Zoom for Government deployment. Let me also thank Brookdale Senior Living, the largest operator of senior housing in the United States. Brookdale started as a Zoom Meetings customer in FY20. A year later, they began evaluating Zoom Phone. And in Q2 they went all-in on the cloud and upgraded to Zoom One, in order to unify their communication needs under one integrated product. Let me also thank Perdue Farms. Like many of our customers\u2019 journeys, Perdue\u2019s started years ago with an initial Zoom Meetings deployment. Last fall, they went all-in with Zoom One Enterprise Plus. However, the story does not end there. In Q2, Perdue added Zoom Contact Center due to its native integration with their existing Zoom Phone deployment and our ambitious innovation roadmap. Let me also thank Valmont Industries. Valmont came onboard as a Zoom customer a little over a year ago with Meetings and Phone and quickly became a major platform adopter, including Zoom One and Zoom Contact Center. And in Q2, with the goal of utilizing AI to better serve their customers and also their employees, they added Zoom Virtual Agent due to its accuracy of intent understanding, ability to route issues to the correct agent, ease of use and quality of analytics. We are so delighted to see our partnership with Valmont grow so quickly and are committed to innovating further to support their operations. Finally, let me thank Dollar General, America\u2019s general store, for choosing Zoom\u2019s Workvivo to connect employees as the digital heartbeat for the company. Dollar General will rollout Workvivo\u2019s employee engagement platform for its roughly 190,000 employees to enhance the employee experience at the individual, group and district levels, drive employee dialogue, and reinforce its strong culture. Again, we are so excited to welcome and expand with USPS, Brookdale, Perdue Farms, Valmont, Dollar General, and all of our customers worldwide. And with that I\u2019ll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. We are pleased that we beat our top line and profitability guidance in Q2. Here are a few milestones. First, operating cash flow grew 31% year-over-year to $336 million. Second, Zoom Phone reached roughly $0.5 billion in annualized run rate revenue. And finally, we are excited that Zoom Contact Center has surpassed 500 customers in only six quarters. In Q2, total revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $1.139 billion, which includes $10 million of pressure from foreign exchange. This result was approximately $24 million above the high end of our guidance. Our Enterprise business grew 10% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue, up from 54% a year ago. We continue to see improvement in Online average monthly churn, which decreased to 3.2% from 3.6% in Q2 of FY '23. The number of Enterprise customers grew 7% year-over-year to approximately 218,100. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers came in Q2 at 109%. We saw 18% year-over-year growth in the upmarket as we ended the quarter with 3,672 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 29% of revenue, up from 26% in Q2 of FY '23 and include some of the amazing names that Eric highlighted earlier. Our Americas revenue grew 6% year-over-year, while EMEA and APAC declined by 1% and 3%, respectively. Absent currency impact, both EMEA and APAC would have been approximately flat year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, all regions grew 3%. Moving to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on strategic investments, restructuring expenses and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 80.3%, an improvement from 78.9% in Q2 of last year. We are pleased with the strength of our gross margins as we continue to optimize usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers for both existing and emerging technologies. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 79.7% as we make additional investments in new AI technologies. Research and development expense grew by 6% year-over-year to approximately $104 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 9.1% from 8.9% in Q2 of last year, reflecting our investments in expanding our product portfolio, including Zoom Contact Center, AI and more. Looking ahead, investing in innovation will remain a top priority for Zoom. Sales and marketing expense decreased by 3% year-over-year to $276 million. This represented approximately 24.2% of total revenue, down from 26% in Q2 of last year. As a reminder, Zoomtopia will be held in Q3 of this year and will drive incremental marketing investment in the quarter. G&A expense declined by 19% to $73 million or approximately 6.4% of total revenue, down from 8.2% in Q2 of last year, as we continue to achieve greater efficiencies and experienced onetime savings in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 17% to $462 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $410 million. This translates to a 40.5% non-GAAP operating margin, a meaningful improvement from 35.8% in Q2 of last year. Our effective tax rate in Q2 was 18.5%. For the remainder of the year, our tax rate is expected to approximate the blended U.S. and federal state rate. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.34 on approximately 306 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.28 above the high end of our guidance and $0.29 higher than Q2 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.37 billion, down approximately 2% from Q2 of last year. This was in line with the high end of the expectations that we shared last quarter. For Q3, we expect deferred revenue to be down 4% to 5% year-over-year, partially driven by shorter billing frequencies on Enterprise deals arising from the high interest rate environment. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO increased 9% year-over-year to approximately $3.5 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 59% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 61% in Q2 of FY '23 indicating lengthening contract durations on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, our renewal seasonality peaks in Q1 and declines throughout the rest of the year. Operating cash flow in the quarter grew 31% year-over-year to $336 million. Free cash flow grew 26% year-over-year to $289 million. Both results include the approximately $60 million cash payment related to the legal settlement that we discussed last quarter. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow margins were 29.5% and 25.4%, respectively. We ended the quarter with approximately $6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. Given the strength in profitability and collections, we are increasing our cash flow outlook for FY '24. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.23 billion. Turning to guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.115 billion to $1.12 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 1% year-over-year growth or 2% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $400 million to $405 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.07 to $1.09 based on approximately 309 million shares outstanding. We are also pleased to raise our top line and profitability outlook for the full year of FY '24. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.485 billion to $4.495 billion. At the midpoint, this represents approximately 2% year-over-year growth or 3% in constant currency, which we expect to be neutral in the back half of the year. Our increased total revenue guidance reflects a consistent view on Enterprise, with tempered expectations for Online for the remainder of the year. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.685 billion to $1.695 billion, representing an operating margin of approximately 38%. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share for FY '24 is $4.63 to $4.67 based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community and our investors for your trust and support. Before opening up for Q&A, we are excited about our premier user conference, Zoomtopia. It will be in person in San Jose as well as on Zoom Events. We look forward to sharing more about our expanding platform, new innovations and customer testimonials. Please join us at Zoomtopia on October 3 and 4. David, Please queue up our first question.\nOperator: Thank you, Kelly. As Kelly mentioned, we will now move into the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] Our question will come from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\nMark Murphy: Well, thank you so much and congrats on solid execution in the quarter. Curious, if you can comment on the Zoom Scheduler product. It looks like a very attractive add-on option and a clear efficiency gain. I understand that, that's going to be free for some period of time and that looks like $6 per month for certain users. I understand it's going to be included in some of the other bundles. But can you just comment on how that's going to work or maybe Eric, you can touch on the efficiency gains from that product? And Kelly, any type of a framework for the revenue potential out of that particular product?\nEric Yuan: Yes. So I can talk on the product side. Clearly, Kelly, feel free to tell on the revenue potential. I think, Mark, you're also right on. I guess probably you already tried it out is indeed very attractive. The reason why you look at the whole customers are -- including Zoomies, right, how we schedule the meeting. Let's see, Mark, I want to schedule a meeting with Zoom next week is so complicated, right? I need to [indiscernible] we think about calendar schedule is so hard, meaning across the company, scheduling is so complicated, right? How to have the customers and simplify that experience, that's why I decided to introduce Zoom Scheduler, right? And also, there are some other start-up solutions out there. The customer, they would like to lever the Zoom platform because they already used Meeting and the Phone, Team Chat, one more click, they can schedule the meeting with somewhere from outside organization, really like that experience. That's why we decided to build that. And we already have a free trial and as a customer [indiscernible] customers already and also be part of the Zoom One as well down the road. And actually, it's doing very well and really simplify the way for you to schedule meetings with any other side of your organization. We're pretty excited about that opportunity.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. I think in terms of its overall contribution, Mark, it\u2019s at a very attractive price point and will grow over time, certainly. But also, we think that what it does is make the product continue to be where you live and make, especially our larger enterprise customers that much more retentive as it continues to spread the platform and how you spend your day.\nMark Murphy: Thank you so much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Mark. Hopefully you try that. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Okay. Our next question comes from Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nKelly Steckelberg: Meta, we can't hear you.\nMeta Marshall: Because I'm on mute. So one of the questions that I had was just, what you're seeing in terms of the environment? I know that your upside kind of came from the Enterprise. Just wanted to get a sense of how the environment changed during the quarter, if there were any changes during the quarter? And just whether kind of that upside came as a result of kind of better upsells or just more deals kind of getting closing in shorter order? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. Thank you, Meta. So I would say in terms of Q2 versus Q1, the environment has been pretty consistent. We continue to see momentum in Zoom One, in Zoom Phone. There are still, I would say, lengthen sales cycles out there and customers really making sure that they take advantage of doing their full due diligence. But we're really excited about the vision that we can take for them not only around, obviously, the existing platform but what's also coming from an AI perspective. And I think our customers are finding that very attractive, as you\u2019ve heard from the customers that Eric talked about seeing a lot of momentum of customers that were originally Meetings customers really moving either into Zoom One or adding on Zoom Phone and considering Contact Center as well.\nMeta Marshall: Great. Thanks.\nEric Yuan: David, next.\nKelly Steckelberg: David, who is next?\nOperator: Apologies. Our next question comes from Kash Rangan from Goldman Sachs.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Kash.\nKasthuri Gopalan: It looks like the Enterprise business is seeing stability with respect to attrition, et cetera. I'm curious to get your thoughts on the Online business. So it's still a substantial part of the revenue and anything that you have identified that could help stabilize the attrition levels? And also, just while we're at it, what is the pricing power of Zoom? Like you talked about customers worried about inflation and doing shorter-term contracts, that I guess on the flip side means that you could raise prices. So wondering how much leverage we have at that. Thank you so much.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So in terms of the Online segment, we were really pleased with the continued improvement that we're seeing in the [indiscernible] rates or the churn rates. They are really at historic lows. And so that's really great to see. And when the interim team continue to innovate, we just saw a little more volatility, and that's what we indicated in sort of tempered expectations for the rest of the year, but really pleased with the ongoing progress that we're seeing in that segment of the business. And then in terms of the pricing power -- I mean, Eric, feel free to chime in. But certainly, we continue to have a discussion with our customers when it comes up for renewals, looking for opportunities to potentially expand their usage of the portfolio, moving them from Zoom Meetings to Zoom One is a very common upsell mechanism or, I should say, movement that we're seeing with our customers today and considering, is there an opportunity potentially given the value that they're seeing in the platform potentially for a price increase at renewal as well?\nKasthuri Gopalan: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. Just quickly, in terms of pricing power and most of the businesses, they still view employ experience as the number one priority, right? That\u2019s why they really wanted to kind of give a customer the best service like a Zoom platform. Otherwise, probably they do not experience on price, that\u2019s not the case, right? And most of the customers we talked with has really appreciated the value and ease of use and quality of Zoom service.\nKasthuri Gopalan: Thanks so much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Kash. Appreciate. You bet.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Funk with Bank of America.\nMichael Funk: Yeah. Hi. Thank you for taking the question today. So congratulations on new logo additions, good momentum there and the Phone adds as well. Just wondering, Kelly, I mean, what has to happen with some of the other metrics, it did decelerate during the quarter. India decelerated sequentially. Online churn up sequentially. Enterprise customer additions also slowed sequentially. So thinking about the acceleration in revenue growth we've been expecting or hoping for, which of those metrics is going to turn first? And how much visibility do you have into that turn?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So a couple of things. Let me just comment on a couple of the metrics that you called out specifically. First of all, the Online term metric. As a reminder, we expect Q2 and Q4 to be seasonally higher than Q1 and Q3. So while it was up over Q1, it was down over Q4, and that's because of summer and winter holiday. So I think the 3.2 number is a really great number. And we are going to continue and continuing to focus on opportunities to improve that. In terms of the Enterprise, we're really focusing on some of the approach as we've talked about earlier. Certainly, Zoom Phone is one of the key drivers in terms of expanding our customers use to the platform. That doesn't necessarily result in new customers, but you could see that in the Enterprise customer metric as that starts to expand also the success of Zoom One is going to drive that expansion of more customers in the $100,000. So I think those are the metrics that you should watch as great indicators as our Enterprise team continues to in Phones in One in Contact Center. And then, of course, as AI becomes more front and center, you'll get to see that as well.\nMichael Funk: So just quickly then, so the NDRR for Enterprise that should improve as we exit the year, is that expectations of 109 (ph) just should improve off that number?\nKelly Steckelberg: You remember, it's a trailing 12-month number. It may come down a little bit more yet, but then start to inflect potentially at the back half of the year, but it might be into early of FY '25.\nMichael Funk: Okay. Thank you, Kelly. Thank you, Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Fish from Piper Sandler.\nJames Fish: Hey, guys. Thanks for the questions. Kelly, for you or Eric, are you seeing optimizations on your seats showing a slowdown or a similar pace to what you've seen more recently? Is there any way to talk about the linearity in general? And Eric, we get the investment behind AI, and it seems like it's causing gross margins to drop a couple of points and guide sequentially. I guess what can you say that gives confidence that this isn't just further price degradation or just a higher level of conservatism on the other side of the coin?\nEric Yuan: Kelly, you wanted to address the first one?\nKelly Steckelberg: So in terms of the optimization of seats, what we've seen is, I think we talked about the sales motion before that our reps have the opportunity to really get in there and talk to our customers and they've done a great job about logo retention. And even if they are customers because they've had a dislocation in their employee base, taking that opportunity then to replace that revenue with an upsell of another product like Zoom Phone and showing them how overall we can drive such a great ROI for them and save them. And our sales team has been incredibly successful at that. And so that's what we're seeing, even though there's still a little bit of shifting, I would say, of seats in there, we're seeing lots of momentum on those upsells at that renewal period. And I just want to highlight, we only -- in terms of gross margin, we had 80.3 this quarter, and we only guided to 79.7. So it's not even 100 basis points of degradation. So Eric can talk about the reasons and why that is and what we're investing in.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. Gross margin is very, very strong. Again, in terms of the impact, it's just a short term, not long term. The reason why -- when it comes to AI, it's becoming more and more important. Many of our customers told us, they rely on Zoom platform, like all the features today, like Meeting Summary. Someone can take a meeting manually, right? How to leverage AI improve the productivity and efficiency, right? For sure, we needed to invest more. The good news is we already invested two to three years ago, right? And that's why some of the feature are already ready. But how to further double down on that investment, right? We hired Dr. XD and also invested in a lot of the GPUs as well, our team, and we have a high confidence and those AI features will have a customer rock, right? And also our strategy is very differentiated, right? First of all, have a federated AI approach. And also the way we look at those AI features, how to help a customer improve productivity, that's very important, right? And because the customer already like us, not like some others, right, who gave you a so-called free services and then your AI features price. That's not our case, right? We really care about the customer value and also add more and more innovations. At the same time, the way for us to look at innovations not only for incremental innovation in terms of revenue AI but also how to lever the AI due to some brand new services to innovate, to deliver more value than customer expected. That's where we can monetize to lever the AI technology. That's why we keep investing more. Again, the goal is about some brand new AI services like Zoom a lot of other services we are going to build it down the road. So stay tuned for the Zoomtopia.\nJames Fish: Thanks, Eric. Thanks, Kelly.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matthew VanVliet, BTIG.\nMatthew VanVliet: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the trends you're seeing in the Contact Center. Can you help us with what situations you're seeing the most success in or the most sort of Meetings and Phone? And then sort of within that, are you seeing more sort of internal help desk-type situations? Or are you seeing kind of higher volume customer-facing deployments as well?\nEric Yuan: Yeah, Matt. It's a great question. First of all, I can tell you, take a Zoom Phone for example. We already deployed the Contact Center Zoom since a year ago, right? And our support team are very happy about our own deployment. It works extremely well, right? Because all those innovations and integrations on customers, right, for sure a loss of innovations every quarter. But the brand recognition, right, it still -- will take some time. That's why quite often all the existing customers, they would likely deploy Zoom Contact Center integration very well with the Zoom Phone and also they a new use case like internal hyperdesk, IT hyperdesk as At the same time, we also have some Contact Center customers no have a Zoom Phone, they don't have a Zoom Meetings. They like a Contact Center. I think given the speed of innovation, I think we have a higher confidence not only SMB but also more and more customer when realize the value of Zoom and Zoom Contact Center, I think something similar to what we did for Zoom Phone as well, right? When we started on existing customer realize, wow, there's a huge value and why not a try or tested out Zoom Contact Center as well, right? So that's the pass for our \u2013 to further grow our Contact Center business.\nMatthew VanVliet: Great. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ryan Koontz with Needham\nRyan Koontz: Hi. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about the healthy growth we're seeing here in the $100,000 accounts. Is that primarily displacement of legacy vendors that we're still seeing or are these other kind of competitive wins, greenfield-type wins? And can you share anything about kind of the effective playbook you're using up market there to expand these big logo wins? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. I think some of that, Ryan, points to the ongoing success we're seeing with Zoom One. Customers really like the ability to buy the bundle, which meets all of their needs. And it's a great opportunity to see the value, especially previously existing Meetings customers seeing that opportunity. We do continue to see greenfield, especially Eric just highlighted Contact Center. Sometimes it's a way that they're coming in the door now, which is amazing. And then also, we still have a lot of customers that are Meetings customers that are upgrading to Phone as well. So it's a combination of both new customers that come in at that level as well as customers that grow up to that level over time.\nRyan Koontz: Got it. Any general changes in the pricing environment market?\nKelly Steckelberg: No, especially from Q1 to Q2, there were won't really significant changes. As I mentioned, there's still think lots of scrutiny around the yields, but no other real changes in the environment.\nRyan Koontz: Got it. Real helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSitikantha Panigrahi: All right. Thanks for taking my question. My question on Contact Center again. That is -- that's a huge opportunity considering like 80% legacy still here to move to cloud. And you are starting from a clean slate, just building yourself in-house. So Eric, how are you trying to differentiate, I mean, among other cloud vendors right now in the Contact Center space. And Kelly, should you think about this Contact Center next leg of growth? Is this adoption should be like Phone what we have seen in the last few years?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So speaking of differentiation, first of all, we built the Contact Center service from ground up, right? This is the new architecture and also video is part of that as well. AI as AI components, we invested in AI and also, at the same time, a seamless integration with other products as well. That's why we have a high confidence, right? And all like some other vendors there for a long, long time, right? And the architecture may not be modern and the performance, the quality and so on and so forth, right? However, how to make sure every Enterprise customer during their RV process, right? They do look at Zoom. When they look at Zoom, we have a higher confidence, we can't compete. And also, we just had a lot of innovations around the Workforce Management platform as well and essentially Zoom Content Center to become our full Contact Center suite. Not just one part, right? It's targeted SMB and Enterprise and also with AI, I think we are innovating very fast, right, to compete against any other cloud-based or on-prem based and Contact Center vendors.\nSitikantha Panigrahi: And is that going to be similar like Phone kind of adoption? [Multiple Speakers]\nEric Yuan: Yes. Sorry, go ahead -- yes.\nKelly Steckelberg: Only six quarters old today. So it's very relative, right, to the existing ARR base. It's small. It's growing very quickly, though. So it won't be visible to you probably for at least another four -- I don't know, four to five to six quarters, probably, but we\u2019re really pleased with the growth. And then as Eric mentioned, when you start considering Workforce Management, of course, Zoom Virtual Agent, Quality Management, which is coming, it starts to be a platform itself that could really be a significant growth driver over time.\nSitikantha Panigrahi: [indiscernible] Zoomtopia.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: Wonderful. Hey, Eric. Hey, Kelly. Thanks so much for taking my question. Two quick ones. First, look, I appreciate a lot of the investments you're making around generative AI. And I know it's early, but I want to think about how do you think longer term about your strategy around monetizing generative AI? Is it around specific modules and discretionally charging for them? Is it about gatekeeping them behind higher tiers and using that to drive upgrades? And maybe alongside that, you're starting to see better adoption, I think, of your noncore products, including Zoom Phone $0.5 billion in ARR. Eric, you called out some great customer wins on Zoom Chat. How do you think about using generative AI as kind of a connective tissue to drive more usage of noncore products and maybe even of the entire Zoom One pricing packaging? Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. That's a wonderful question. So look at the Zoom platform, right, so not only do we have Meetings, right? So some people still sort of we're just a Meeting company [indiscernible] of a full company, right? For those customers, we deployed like Team Chat, USPS deployed Zoom Team Chat. A lot of companies deployed the Zoom Phone and Whiteboard Zoom Contact Center as well Scheduler and also the Zoom Clips. As we build more and more services, right, and essentially, when we double on our platform, how to look at everything from a customer perspective, how to add more value? Let's take a Zoom One, for example. Customers say, I really like Zoom, already paid a platform. A lot of features to take this generative features like Meeting summary and to leverage GenAI to Team Chat and meeting inquiry and let's say, you are late to the meeting, how to get a quick real-time summary about what had been discussed over the past 5 minutes. All those GenAI features can make the entire platform, not only sticky, but also more value, right? So quite often, some customers say, yes, you can charge and some other competitors do that. We are taking a different approach. We think if you add more value to customers, and they are doing more -- were likely to move on to our entire platform, right? It does not mean we cannot monetize AI. How do you think about AI to build new services, right? [indiscernible] one example. Back to 1995, 1996, I mean Internet was sort of born, when every -- let's say, the stores, right, when they Internet, you do not want to increase the price, right? You buy online, why increase price? However, you can have the Internet to build new services, right, new innovations. That's why we're taking a different approach, not as some other competitors. They gave us free service AI, oh my god, they charge you a crazy price. I do not think that\u2019s fair to customers, right? And we are taking a different approach and more value to leverage GenAI to our existing customers focus on the future improvements to leverage GenAI. At the same time, given our speed of innovation, how to leverage GenAI to build some brand new AI services to monetize. That\u2019s our goal. That\u2019s our direction. That\u2019s our differentiated pricing strategy as well. Hopefully, my answer is clear. Otherwise, let\u2019s talk more at Zoomtopia.\nRishi Jaluria: Yeah. Very helpful. I\u2019m looking forward to it. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Zukin with Wolf Research.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, so when I sit back and look at the quarter, this quarter looks a little bit different than last quarter. You grew sequentially your revenue base on Enterprise and Online for the first time together in some time where both of those things happen. Your Enterprise billings actually grew as well. And so I look at the guidance, and it looks like we're taking a step back, and I appreciate the conservatism in the macroeconomic environment. I appreciate the fact that you've got changes you're still working through in the go-to-market. But help us understand, if we look at the trends as they -- as churn stabilized to a point where we can expect, for instance, on the Online business that this is a new floor we can count on. Because if I look at the exit rate for Enterprise revenue, I don't think it's at the rate that any of us sitting here would be jumping up and down about you mentioned NRR on the Enterprise side starting to -- I think you said in but maybe go back up in the first half of next year, what's the right way to interpret the Enterprise growth exiting this year and into next year? And then I've got a quick follow-up.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So in terms of Online, I would say that we are very pleased with the performance that we're seeing in the churn rate itself. And I do think we're stabilizing around a new level that is back to historic levels. And I think that's a reasonable assumption to make going forward. And then in terms of Enterprise, we're obviously not in a place that we're going to comment on FY '25 yet. We're not going to do that on this call. But Enterprise, when you look at it from -- I don't say this for you. When you look at it in terms of the growth rate that you're expecting, you've been back into, right, what it is. And we are, as you say, still considering no improvement from the macro at this point. And as you said, continuing to have the sales force settle into our new structure. We're thrilled to have Graeme leading the organization. We -- some of the transitions took a little bit longer in EMEA and APAC than the rest of the world, as you've heard us talk about. But as we're coming into Q3, the pipeline is strong. It's stronger than it was as we were coming into Q2. So I think those are the factors you can take into consideration as you're looking for the growth rate for the rest of the year.\nAlex Zukin: Okay. And then maybe, Eric, for you. Obviously, the evolution of Zoom from a point solution to a platform is nice to watch. You've talked about Zoom One. You've now given us that $500 million annualized number for Zoom Phone. What's the penetration today for Zoom One within the Enterprise base? And what's the penetration for the Phone product in the Enterprise base? And where does it go from here in your mind, like what does success look like for you?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. I think Zoom Phone penetration is doing relatively well. But Zoom One, I think still we had a huge opportunity, right? Zoom one is not only for Zoom Meetings, the Phone, right? Also the Team Chat, if the customer wanted to deploy our free Team Chat solution and Whiteboard and a lot of other services, right, I think a huge opportunity, especially for medium and larger-sized customers and we needed to kind of share them the value. As I said earlier, about like GenAI features, all those kind of things is part of Zoom One, right? So leverage all those up, the cool features, right to penetrate more about Zoom One the market share, right? And Zoom Phone itself doing right at well, but a huge opportunity ahead of us for Zoom One penetration. And I will say we just started. I give one example. I take USPS, for example. When the reader is wow, you have a greater Team Chat solution is also part of Zoom One and also it's free. That's amazing, [indiscernible] why not deploy Zoom One, right? So many more customers when they realize the full potential of a Zoom One platform, I think that's the value, right? We need to do focus on.\nAlex Zukin: Thank you, guys.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Alex.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Peter Weed with Bernstein.\nPeter Weed: Thank you. And maybe this kind of follows up a little bit of what Alex just getting at. But first off, I want to say it's really exciting to see the progress on Zoom Phone and Contact Center. It's been amazing to watch that and all the checks I do with folks are very positive on things that are going there. I think, Kelly, you commented a few minutes ago and were to think with Alex here, that NRR may come down a bit before it starts reaccelerating maybe by the end of this fiscal year and maybe the beginning of next year, we start to see some line of sight to some benefit there. I'd really love to kind of dig into like what will drive that improvement? And kind of when split the customer base, you do a really nice job of reporting bolt-on greater than 100,000 and less than 100,000, like some quick math suggests where it's been really painful recently is on the greater than 100,000 customers. And I tried to figure out like on that reacceleration is it about kind of reigniting those greater than 100,000 is the opportunity with the less than $100,000, like growing them up because they're less mature. And like really what is it that you are going to be delivering with these customers to reignite that between those customer bases?\nKelly Steckelberg: So one of the things I commented on is that we have seen some dislocation in our customers' own employee base and that our sales reps do a great job when they're talking to those customers about helping them potentially right size if they have downsize in their employee base, but upselling and retaining that revenue in other parts of our platform. So that -- as is there's still pressure in the macroeconomic environment, you're going to see that a little bit, right? So maintaining logos, even maintaining the same amount of revenue, but would have been an upsell, if not for a down sell due to seat. So part of it is just an ongoing potential change in the macro, which we have not factored into the guidance that we gave. And then the continued acceleration of all these new products that we keep talking about, right? Phone is obviously doing really well. And it's well hit its stride. But remember, that's taken three to four years to accomplish. And so Contact Center that we expect to follow the same is just -- it just needs a little more time. And then you heard about all the additions into the Contact Center platform itself with ZDA, with Workforce Management and Quality Management that's coming, all of those will continue contribute to growth over time. And then Eric sort of hinted thinking about the ways that AI over time is going to help with both retention as well as potential opportunity to grow revenue. So it's just -- some of these things just have to grow a little bit or age a little bit and mature into the stage that they're contributing in a way that you can see them.\nPeter Weed: And how high do you anticipate NRR being able to get once all that stuff works out? I mean, obviously, you've seen some of those headwinds. So you kind of know how much you're like I lost this and it would have been so much better. Like if you're looking forward, like what should we aspire to be getting NRR back to? And like how soon do you think we can get there?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Peter, we'll talk about that more when we're ready to give FY '25 guidance, but not today.\nEric Yuan: Yeah, I can take a little bit more, Peter. So the question you asked was very similar to what about Zoom One. Actually, today, the problem is Zoom is a too strong brand on Meetings side, right, right? Many of the customers unfortunately, they even did not realize we have a lot of other services, not to mention a Zoom One platform, right? That's the number one challenge that we are facing. How to make sure all those \u2013 even existing \u2013 even for existing customers. They also think Zoom just a meeting, that\u2019s not the case, right? When we and share a greater story, make sure most of our customers are publicly realize our Zoom not only just the meetings had a full platform, I think the inflection point will not happen until then.\nPeter Weed: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Taz Koujalgi with Wedbush.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Two questions. First one for Kelly. I think you had a price increase for the Online business in Q1, and that was being phased out, I think, in different geos at different times. Has that been rolled out across the globe? And if you can comment on any tailwind you saw from that price increase in the Q2 Online business?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So it has been very effective in general in terms of maintaining strong retention rates and moving customers from monthly to annual as they continue to see value when we rolled out this price increase. And given that it's been in effect for the full time now, we're not going to break out, but it break it out separately, but it certainly is overall having a great impact including in the momentum for our Online and it is -- I believe it's live in every market at this point.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Got it. And then one follow-up on Contact Center. I know it's just pretty early you've just started -- you've just had your first early customers. But any comments on price points you're seeing and attach rate of seats. So let's say a customer has 100 seats of Zoom Meeting, when customers buy a Contact Center, what is kind of the attach rate that you're seeing for these early customers?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. It's -- I mean it's very different, right, in terms of it's not anywhere near, like Phone, typically is near one to one and sometimes even more one to one attach rate. Contact Center is very different. It depends on the use case we're seeing of the customers. If it's an internal help desk, or if it's like -- one of our largest deals to date was a BPO, where it is their business, right, to drive Contact Center. So I don't think there's necessarily a standard ratio that you can look at because it varies so much based on use cases. And then in terms of pricing, as a reminder, our list price for Contact Center is highly disruptive. It's $70 per seat. And given -- comparing that, it's -- given comparing it to the other competitors in the market, it's a really -- I think it brings a lot of value to our customers. So while Enterprise customers and large customers are going to get discounts, we've certainly been able to manage to maintain price points, given how disruptive and competitive it is compared to others in the market.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Guys, sneaking just one more clarification. Kelly, you mentioned that we won't have visibility into Contact Center revenues for another four to six quarters. It's still very early. Were you implying that it will be close to 10% of revenues in four to six quarters?\nKelly Steckelberg: No. I don't mean to imply that at all. I just mean that I see laughing -- that over time, you started to see Zoom Phone and we talked about like more milestone metrics and how it was contributing, that's what I was saying. I mean that would be the best growth rate if that were to occur.\nImtiaz Koujalgi: Got it. Thank you guys. Thanks a lot.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Stotler with William Blair.\nMatthew Stotler: Hey. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just a follow-up on Zoom Phone. If I look at the disclosure this quarter, $500 million ARR and last quarter, Zoom Phone 10% of revenue. The implication would be something in the ballpark of, let's say, 10%, maybe a little more sequentially in terms of growth for Zoom Phone ARR. I'll just dig into -- or double-click on, I guess, what's driving that growth, right? Is that indicative of the success we're seeing is Zoom One? Is that evidence of go-to-market maturity there? Is it some large customers like the BPO you just mentioned kind of ramping up? Anything you'd like to call out there?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. I mean, actually, Matt, it's all of the above is what I would say. It's -- as we've taken -- as we are talking to our customers about renewals, taking the opportunity to talk to them about the value of Zoom One or talking about just helping them -- I think every CFO and CIO across the world today is trying to think about how do they drive more efficiencies in their organization and Zoom Phone is a great way to do that when you look at it compared to the ROI, especially of having an on-prem solution. And then also with Contact Center -- Contact Center is a driving force, Zoom Phone is a very natural adjacency to it. So I think it's a combination of all of that, and it's just going to continue to create more and more synergies as Zoom Contact Center especially continues to mature.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Just quickly, when we talk with our customers, they really like we have a both -- they deploy both Zoom Meeting and Zoom Phone together. The Contact Center, a new opportunity, in particular, for those customers I think they don't want to deploy a point of solution, right? If you just have a Phone business, it's really hard to build a sustainable business customer Phone and Meetings, some of \u2013 they\u2019re very similarly integration, like you have a phone call, one more click and jump on the video meeting, right? So that\u2019s \u2013 that kind of a similar experience really helped us further our Phone growth, right? If you just offer a point of solution, it\u2019s really not scalable, not a sustainable. And down the road, more and more customers would like to move on platform play like a Zoom.\nMatthew Stotler: Got it. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Sterling Auty with Moffett Nathanson.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Sterling.\nSterling Auty: Hey, guys. All right. Kelly, for the Online outlook, how much of this is that -- because it seems like the Online guidance is a little bit worse than what we had before. How much of this is macro? How much of this is execution? And Eric, one for you. When we think about AI and all the innovation that you're driving, how much of that AI innovation is just going to be driving and differentiating the core Zoom products versus bringing a premium monetization kind of pricing model or specific AI SKUs?\nKelly Steckelberg: Eric, do you want to go first?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. So first of all, in terms of Online study. I know you have an account. Hopefully, you still have account. And for sure, it can contribute to our Online growth. So speaking about AI, I think we are taking a different approach. As I said earlier, from an architecture perspective, it's different, federated AI. In terms of monetization, right, again, we look at it how to leverage GenAI to improve our core Meeting experience and deliver more value, make the services more sticky Zoom always offer more and more features values. And at the same time, we do not kind of charge price, increase the price a lot at all, right? That's right, we build a trust. They want to go to for Zoom Phone platform. At the same time, GenAI does bring huge opportunity like in terms of monetization, in terms of the new service. As I said earlier, how to leverage GenAI to build some branded new service. You cannot only turn on low-hanging fruits. You already deployed this service. I have a GenAI feature now, you need to pay crazy price. I do not think that's sustainable. A customer do not like it. right? That's our approach, how to leverage GenAI to make sure existing customer happy and leverage GenAI to build new services focused on innovation, innovation and innovation. That's our approach.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric. And Sterling, in terms of Online, I would say we're pleased with the execution and where you see that is the ongoing stabilization in the churn rate. That, I think, has been really, really well done and stabilized over the last 4 quarters now. And I think that's a really great indication of the ongoing improvements of the platform, the buy flow, the movement of customers from monthly to annual where we do see some ongoing headwinds is in the overall macro, which is driving more for the top of the funnel. And that's where when the team continue to focus on new pricing packages, new payment currencies, things they can focus on to expand the top of the funnel so that over time and then eventually starting to add new products as well that can be sold online. That's what will eventually drive this. Ideally, we want it to not only be stable but to be a growth driver as well.\nSterling Auty: Makes sense.\nEric Yuan: Thank you, Sterling.\nOperator: Okay. We have time for one more question. And that last question goes to William Power with Baird.\nWilliam Power: Okay. Great. Thanks for taking me in. Maybe one more question on Contact Center. Great to see the traction there. I wonder if perhaps, Eric, if you can update us on where you are with respect to go to market? I know that has been a big focus. How much more room and opportunity is there on that front? And then I guess the second part of that is it feels like there's a big opportunity with respect to AI Contact Center being a new entrant, how do you think about the opportunity for whether it's virtual or other capabilities to help you be even more disruptive in that market?\nEric Yuan: Yeah. Great question. So yes, speaking of go-to-market, I think on product front, we have a high, high confidence innovation speed, we have so many features and Workforce Management, a lot of other features are being introduced every quarter. In terms of go-to-market, I think not like what we did before for Meetings, right, by and large, more like primarily driven by [indiscernible] business, Contact Center is different. For sure, we need to double down, triple down on the indirect channel, right, embrace all the sort of partners and master agent and so on so forth. And we need to invest more on that front. And essentially, this is one of the things why not like Zoom Phone [indiscernible] accelerated revenue, but even have a greater Contact Center product. As you see the progress on go-to market front, I think that we will see the great result. And in terms of AI, not like other vendors, right, they already have Contact Center solution for a long, long time. When you look at AI kind of architecture and flexible, right, how to add AI to that to all those existing leaders the Contact Center. We already realized the importance of AI, right? That's why we have a very flexible architecture. Not only do we build organic AI features but also acquired Solvvy and also the Virtual Agent and so on and so forth. Organic growth and also the acquisition certainly help us a lot in terms of product innovation. And AI is going to put a big look for the Contact Center. We have higher confidence we can do very well on that front.\nWilliam Power: Thank you.\nA \u2013 Eric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Okay. This concludes our Q&A. I would now like to pass things back to Eric for closing comments.\nEric Yuan: Thank you all for joining us for the Q2 earnings call. I really appreciate for your great support and very, very beautiful. And thank you. Appreciate.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: We thank you all for your participation, and we look forward to seeing you again. This concludes today's conference. Enjoy the rest of your day.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nOperator: Good-bye.",

            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric, and hello, everyone. We are pleased that we beat our top line and profitability guidance in Q2. Here are a few milestones. First, operating cash flow grew 31% year-over-year to $336 million. Second, Zoom Phone reached roughly $0.5 billion in annualized run rate revenue. And finally, we are excited that Zoom Contact Center has surpassed 500 customers in only six quarters. In Q2, total revenue grew 4% year-over-year to $1.139 billion, which includes $10 million of pressure from foreign exchange. This result was approximately $24 million above the high end of our guidance. Our Enterprise business grew 10% year-over-year and represented 58% of total revenue, up from 54% a year ago. We continue to see improvement in Online average monthly churn, which decreased to 3.2% from 3.6% in Q2 of FY '23. The number of Enterprise customers grew 7% year-over-year to approximately 218,100. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers came in Q2 at 109%. We saw 18% year-over-year growth in the upmarket as we ended the quarter with 3,672 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 29% of revenue, up from 26% in Q2 of FY '23 and include some of the amazing names that Eric highlighted earlier. Our Americas revenue grew 6% year-over-year, while EMEA and APAC declined by 1% and 3%, respectively. Absent currency impact, both EMEA and APAC would have been approximately flat year-over-year. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, all regions grew 3%. Moving to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on strategic investments, restructuring expenses and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q2 was 80.3%, an improvement from 78.9% in Q2 of last year. We are pleased with the strength of our gross margins as we continue to optimize usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers for both existing and emerging technologies. For the full year, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 79.7% as we make additional investments in new AI technologies. Research and development expense grew by 6% year-over-year to approximately $104 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 9.1% from 8.9% in Q2 of last year, reflecting our investments in expanding our product portfolio, including Zoom Contact Center, AI and more. Looking ahead, investing in innovation will remain a top priority for Zoom. Sales and marketing expense decreased by 3% year-over-year to $276 million. This represented approximately 24.2% of total revenue, down from 26% in Q2 of last year. As a reminder, Zoomtopia will be held in Q3 of this year and will drive incremental marketing investment in the quarter. G&A expense declined by 19% to $73 million or approximately 6.4% of total revenue, down from 8.2% in Q2 of last year, as we continue to achieve greater efficiencies and experienced onetime savings in the quarter. Non-GAAP operating income grew by 17% to $462 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $410 million. This translates to a 40.5% non-GAAP operating margin, a meaningful improvement from 35.8% in Q2 of last year. Our effective tax rate in Q2 was 18.5%. For the remainder of the year, our tax rate is expected to approximate the blended U.S. and federal state rate. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q2 was $1.34 on approximately 306 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.28 above the high end of our guidance and $0.29 higher than Q2 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.37 billion, down approximately 2% from Q2 of last year. This was in line with the high end of the expectations that we shared last quarter. For Q3, we expect deferred revenue to be down 4% to 5% year-over-year, partially driven by shorter billing frequencies on Enterprise deals arising from the high interest rate environment. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO increased 9% year-over-year to approximately $3.5 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 59% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months as compared to 61% in Q2 of FY '23 indicating lengthening contract durations on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, our renewal seasonality peaks in Q1 and declines throughout the rest of the year. Operating cash flow in the quarter grew 31% year-over-year to $336 million. Free cash flow grew 26% year-over-year to $289 million. Both results include the approximately $60 million cash payment related to the legal settlement that we discussed last quarter. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow margins were 29.5% and 25.4%, respectively. We ended the quarter with approximately $6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. Given the strength in profitability and collections, we are increasing our cash flow outlook for FY '24. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.23 billion. Turning to guidance. For Q3, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.115 billion to $1.12 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 1% year-over-year growth or 2% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $400 million to $405 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.07 to $1.09 based on approximately 309 million shares outstanding. We are also pleased to raise our top line and profitability outlook for the full year of FY '24. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $4.485 billion to $4.495 billion. At the midpoint, this represents approximately 2% year-over-year growth or 3% in constant currency, which we expect to be neutral in the back half of the year. Our increased total revenue guidance reflects a consistent view on Enterprise, with tempered expectations for Online for the remainder of the year. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.685 billion to $1.695 billion, representing an operating margin of approximately 38%. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share for FY '24 is $4.63 to $4.67 based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community and our investors for your trust and support. Before opening up for Q&A, we are excited about our premier user conference, Zoomtopia. It will be in person in San Jose as well as on Zoom Events. We look forward to sharing more about our expanding platform, new innovations and customer testimonials. Please join us at Zoomtopia on October 3 and 4. David, Please queue up our first question. Yeah. I think in terms of its overall contribution, Mark, it's at a very attractive price point and will grow over time, certainly. But also, we think that what it does is make the product continue to be where you live and make, especially our larger enterprise customers that much more retentive as it continues to spread the platform and how you spend your day. Meta, we can't hear you. Yeah. Thank you, Meta. So I would say in terms of Q2 versus Q1, the environment has been pretty consistent. We continue to see momentum in Zoom One, in Zoom Phone. There are still, I would say, lengthen sales cycles out there and customers really making sure that they take advantage of doing their full due diligence. But we're really excited about the vision that we can take for them not only around, obviously, the existing platform but what's also coming from an AI perspective. And I think our customers are finding that very attractive, as you've heard from the customers that Eric talked about seeing a lot of momentum of customers that were originally Meetings customers really moving either into Zoom One or adding on Zoom Phone and considering Contact Center as well. David, who is next? Hi, Kash. Yeah. So in terms of the Online segment, we were really pleased with the continued improvement that we're seeing in the [indiscernible] rates or the churn rates. They are really at historic lows. And so that's really great to see. And when the interim team continue to innovate, we just saw a little more volatility, and that's what we indicated in sort of tempered expectations for the rest of the year, but really pleased with the ongoing progress that we're seeing in that segment of the business. And then in terms of the pricing power -- I mean, Eric, feel free to chime in. But certainly, we continue to have a discussion with our customers when it comes up for renewals, looking for opportunities to potentially expand their usage of the portfolio, moving them from Zoom Meetings to Zoom One is a very common upsell mechanism or, I should say, movement that we're seeing with our customers today and considering, is there an opportunity potentially given the value that they're seeing in the platform potentially for a price increase at renewal as well? Yeah. So a couple of things. Let me just comment on a couple of the metrics that you called out specifically. First of all, the Online term metric. As a reminder, we expect Q2 and Q4 to be seasonally higher than Q1 and Q3. So while it was up over Q1, it was down over Q4, and that's because of summer and winter holiday. So I think the 3.2 number is a really great number. And we are going to continue and continuing to focus on opportunities to improve that. In terms of the Enterprise, we're really focusing on some of the approach as we've talked about earlier. Certainly, Zoom Phone is one of the key drivers in terms of expanding our customers use to the platform. That doesn't necessarily result in new customers, but you could see that in the Enterprise customer metric as that starts to expand also the success of Zoom One is going to drive that expansion of more customers in the $100,000. So I think those are the metrics that you should watch as great indicators as our Enterprise team continues to in Phones in One in Contact Center. And then, of course, as AI becomes more front and center, you'll get to see that as well. You remember, it's a trailing 12-month number. It may come down a little bit more yet, but then start to inflect potentially at the back half of the year, but it might be into early of FY '25. So in terms of the optimization of seats, what we've seen is, I think we talked about the sales motion before that our reps have the opportunity to really get in there and talk to our customers and they've done a great job about logo retention. And even if they are customers because they've had a dislocation in their employee base, taking that opportunity then to replace that revenue with an upsell of another product like Zoom Phone and showing them how overall we can drive such a great ROI for them and save them. And our sales team has been incredibly successful at that. And so that's what we're seeing, even though there's still a little bit of shifting, I would say, of seats in there, we're seeing lots of momentum on those upsells at that renewal period. And I just want to highlight, we only -- in terms of gross margin, we had 80.3 this quarter, and we only guided to 79.7. So it's not even 100 basis points of degradation. So Eric can talk about the reasons and why that is and what we're investing in. Yeah. I think some of that, Ryan, points to the ongoing success we're seeing with Zoom One. Customers really like the ability to buy the bundle, which meets all of their needs. And it's a great opportunity to see the value, especially previously existing Meetings customers seeing that opportunity. We do continue to see greenfield, especially Eric just highlighted Contact Center. Sometimes it's a way that they're coming in the door now, which is amazing. And then also, we still have a lot of customers that are Meetings customers that are upgrading to Phone as well. So it's a combination of both new customers that come in at that level as well as customers that grow up to that level over time. No, especially from Q1 to Q2, there were won't really significant changes. As I mentioned, there's still think lots of scrutiny around the yields, but no other real changes in the environment. Only six quarters old today. So it's very relative, right, to the existing ARR base. It's small. It's growing very quickly, though. So it won't be visible to you probably for at least another four -- I don't know, four to five to six quarters, probably, but we're really pleased with the growth. And then as Eric mentioned, when you start considering Workforce Management, of course, Zoom Virtual Agent, Quality Management, which is coming, it starts to be a platform itself that could really be a significant growth driver over time. Yeah. So in terms of Online, I would say that we are very pleased with the performance that we're seeing in the churn rate itself. And I do think we're stabilizing around a new level that is back to historic levels. And I think that's a reasonable assumption to make going forward. And then in terms of Enterprise, we're obviously not in a place that we're going to comment on FY '25 yet. We're not going to do that on this call. But Enterprise, when you look at it from -- I don't say this for you. When you look at it in terms of the growth rate that you're expecting, you've been back into, right, what it is. And we are, as you say, still considering no improvement from the macro at this point. And as you said, continuing to have the sales force settle into our new structure. We're thrilled to have Graeme leading the organization. We -- some of the transitions took a little bit longer in EMEA and APAC than the rest of the world, as you've heard us talk about. But as we're coming into Q3, the pipeline is strong. It's stronger than it was as we were coming into Q2. So I think those are the factors you can take into consideration as you're looking for the growth rate for the rest of the year. So one of the things I commented on is that we have seen some dislocation in our customers' own employee base and that our sales reps do a great job when they're talking to those customers about helping them potentially right size if they have downsize in their employee base, but upselling and retaining that revenue in other parts of our platform. So that -- as is there's still pressure in the macroeconomic environment, you're going to see that a little bit, right? So maintaining logos, even maintaining the same amount of revenue, but would have been an upsell, if not for a down sell due to seat. So part of it is just an ongoing potential change in the macro, which we have not factored into the guidance that we gave. And then the continued acceleration of all these new products that we keep talking about, right? Phone is obviously doing really well. And it's well hit its stride. But remember, that's taken three to four years to accomplish. And so Contact Center that we expect to follow the same is just -- it just needs a little more time. And then you heard about all the additions into the Contact Center platform itself with ZDA, with Workforce Management and Quality Management that's coming, all of those will continue contribute to growth over time. And then Eric sort of hinted thinking about the ways that AI over time is going to help with both retention as well as potential opportunity to grow revenue. So it's just -- some of these things just have to grow a little bit or age a little bit and mature into the stage that they're contributing in a way that you can see them. Yes. Peter, we'll talk about that more when we're ready to give FY '25 guidance, but not today. Yeah. So it has been very effective in general in terms of maintaining strong retention rates and moving customers from monthly to annual as they continue to see value when we rolled out this price increase. And given that it's been in effect for the full time now, we're not going to break out, but it break it out separately, but it certainly is overall having a great impact including in the momentum for our Online and it is -- I believe it's live in every market at this point. Yeah. It's -- I mean it's very different, right, in terms of it's not anywhere near, like Phone, typically is near one to one and sometimes even more one to one attach rate. Contact Center is very different. It depends on the use case we're seeing of the customers. If it's an internal help desk, or if it's like -- one of our largest deals to date was a BPO, where it is their business, right, to drive Contact Center. So I don't think there's necessarily a standard ratio that you can look at because it varies so much based on use cases. And then in terms of pricing, as a reminder, our list price for Contact Center is highly disruptive. It's $70 per seat. And given -- comparing that, it's -- given comparing it to the other competitors in the market, it's a really -- I think it brings a lot of value to our customers. So while Enterprise customers and large customers are going to get discounts, we've certainly been able to manage to maintain price points, given how disruptive and competitive it is compared to others in the market. No. I don't mean to imply that at all. I just mean that I see laughing -- that over time, you started to see Zoom Phone and we talked about like more milestone metrics and how it was contributing, that's what I was saying. I mean that would be the best growth rate if that were to occur. Yeah. I mean, actually, Matt, it's all of the above is what I would say. It's -- as we've taken -- as we are talking to our customers about renewals, taking the opportunity to talk to them about the value of Zoom One or talking about just helping them -- I think every CFO and CIO across the world today is trying to think about how do they drive more efficiencies in their organization and Zoom Phone is a great way to do that when you look at it compared to the ROI, especially of having an on-prem solution. And then also with Contact Center -- Contact Center is a driving force, Zoom Phone is a very natural adjacency to it. So I think it's a combination of all of that, and it's just going to continue to create more and more synergies as Zoom Contact Center especially continues to mature. Hi, Sterling. Eric, do you want to go first? Thank you, Eric. And Sterling, in terms of Online, I would say we're pleased with the execution and where you see that is the ongoing stabilization in the churn rate. That, I think, has been really, really well done and stabilized over the last 4 quarters now. And I think that's a really great indication of the ongoing improvements of the platform, the buy flow, the movement of customers from monthly to annual where we do see some ongoing headwinds is in the overall macro, which is driving more for the top of the funnel. And that's where when the team continue to focus on new pricing packages, new payment currencies, things they can focus on to expand the top of the funnel so that over time and then eventually starting to add new products as well that can be sold online. That's what will eventually drive this. Ideally, we want it to not only be stable but to be a growth driver as well. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Eric Yuan",
            "content": "Hey. Thank you, Tom. Hey. Thank you everyone for joining us today. So before starting, I'd like to welcome Dr. Xuedong Huang as our CTO, who joins us after a successful career at Microsoft, where he most recently served as Azure AI CTO and Technical Fellow. Dr. XD joins us at an optimal moment in our AI journey. In the past few months, we brought several new AI innovations to the market and announced an aggressive roadmap aimed at empowering our customers to work smarter and serve their customers better. And, as we develop and deploy AI solutions, we strongly believe that technology should advance trust. We are privileged to have countless customers rely on us for their communications needs. We don't take that for granted. Earlier this month, we took the additional step in stating that Zoom does NOT use customer content to train our AI models or third-party AI models. I'm proud of the approach we are taking. By putting customers' privacy needs first, Zoom is taking a leadership position in ensuring customers can use our AI features with confidence that their content is protected. Now, let me share how we have advanced in our mission of: One Platform Delivering Limitless Human Connection. We launched Zoom Scheduler, which serves to reduce the hassle of scheduling with people outside your organization, and Intelligent Director, which uses AI and multiple cameras to provide the best image and angle of participants joining from a conference room. We also launched many new offerings like Zoom Clips, which enables asynchronous video conversations. And more and more customers are getting on Zoom Team Chat, driven by increased adoption of Zoom One and new features like Continuous Meeting Chat, which connects the transient in-meeting chat feature to the persistent Zoom Team Chat product. Currently, we have two fortune 15 companies, one major consulting firm, a global F&B brand and a leading law firm using Zoom Team Chat as a core means of text-based communications. Our Contact Center product has surpassed 500 customers and we are rolling out about 90 new features and enhancements per quarter. We launched Workforce Management in early July to help customers streamline customer communications, manage agent needs, and transform their customer experience all from a single, unified platform. WFM is already off to a great start and we look forward to adding additional products to this suite to expand our native customer experience capabilities and revenue streams. We have progressed rapidly in our integration of Workvivo. After rolling it out internally, I could not be more impressed with the product and confident in the value it will bring to our customers in terms of building culture across a distributed workforce, ultimately delivering upon our strategic pillar of enabling hybrid work. Speaking of which, a few weeks ago, we announced internally a structured hybrid approach -- asking our Zoomies that live within commuting distance to come into their local office twice a week. Zoom is purpose-built for hybrid work and it is on us to understand what our customers are experiencing in their hybrid journeys and what works and does not work for them. We believe that this approach will enable us to continue to innovate for our customers and deliver what they need to succeed. Now moving on to some of our customer wins. First, we are excited to expand with the United States Postal Service. In Q2, the postal service added Zoom Team Chat for 21,500 users to their existing Zoom for Government deployment. Let me also thank Brookdale Senior Living, the largest operator of senior housing in the United States. Brookdale started as a Zoom Meetings customer in FY20. A year later, they began evaluating Zoom Phone. And in Q2 they went all-in on the cloud and upgraded to Zoom One, in order to unify their communication needs under one integrated product. Let me also thank Perdue Farms. Like many of our customers' journeys, Perdue's started years ago with an initial Zoom Meetings deployment. Last fall, they went all-in with Zoom One Enterprise Plus. However, the story does not end there. In Q2, Perdue added Zoom Contact Center due to its native integration with their existing Zoom Phone deployment and our ambitious innovation roadmap. Let me also thank Valmont Industries. Valmont came onboard as a Zoom customer a little over a year ago with Meetings and Phone and quickly became a major platform adopter, including Zoom One and Zoom Contact Center. And in Q2, with the goal of utilizing AI to better serve their customers and also their employees, they added Zoom Virtual Agent due to its accuracy of intent understanding, ability to route issues to the correct agent, ease of use and quality of analytics. We are so delighted to see our partnership with Valmont grow so quickly and are committed to innovating further to support their operations. Finally, let me thank Dollar General, America's general store, for choosing Zoom's Workvivo to connect employees as the digital heartbeat for the company. Dollar General will rollout Workvivo's employee engagement platform for its roughly 190,000 employees to enhance the employee experience at the individual, group and district levels, drive employee dialogue, and reinforce its strong culture. Again, we are so excited to welcome and expand with USPS, Brookdale, Perdue Farms, Valmont, Dollar General, and all of our customers worldwide. And with that I'll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you. Yes. So I can talk on the product side. Clearly, Kelly, feel free to tell on the revenue potential. I think, Mark, you're also right on. I guess probably you already tried it out is indeed very attractive. The reason why you look at the whole customers are -- including Zoomies, right, how we schedule the meeting. Let's see, Mark, I want to schedule a meeting with Zoom next week is so complicated, right? I need to [indiscernible] we think about calendar schedule is so hard, meaning across the company, scheduling is so complicated, right? How to have the customers and simplify that experience, that's why I decided to introduce Zoom Scheduler, right? And also, there are some other start-up solutions out there. The customer, they would like to lever the Zoom platform because they already used Meeting and the Phone, Team Chat, one more click, they can schedule the meeting with somewhere from outside organization, really like that experience. That's why we decided to build that. And we already have a free trial and as a customer [indiscernible] customers already and also be part of the Zoom One as well down the road. And actually, it's doing very well and really simplify the way for you to schedule meetings with any other side of your organization. We're pretty excited about that opportunity. Thank you, Mark. Hopefully you try that. Thank you. Appreciate it. David, next. Yeah. Just quickly, in terms of pricing power and most of the businesses, they still view employ experience as the number one priority, right? That's why they really wanted to kind of give a customer the best service like a Zoom platform. Otherwise, probably they do not experience on price, that's not the case, right? And most of the customers we talked with has really appreciated the value and ease of use and quality of Zoom service. Thank you, Kash. Appreciate. You bet. Thank you. Kelly, you wanted to address the first one? Yeah. Gross margin is very, very strong. Again, in terms of the impact, it's just a short term, not long term. The reason why -- when it comes to AI, it's becoming more and more important. Many of our customers told us, they rely on Zoom platform, like all the features today, like Meeting Summary. Someone can take a meeting manually, right? How to leverage AI improve the productivity and efficiency, right? For sure, we needed to invest more. The good news is we already invested two to three years ago, right? And that's why some of the feature are already ready. But how to further double down on that investment, right? We hired Dr. XD and also invested in a lot of the GPUs as well, our team, and we have a high confidence and those AI features will have a customer rock, right? And also our strategy is very differentiated, right? First of all, have a federated AI approach. And also the way we look at those AI features, how to help a customer improve productivity, that's very important, right? And because the customer already like us, not like some others, right, who gave you a so-called free services and then your AI features price. That's not our case, right? We really care about the customer value and also add more and more innovations. At the same time, the way for us to look at innovations not only for incremental innovation in terms of revenue AI but also how to lever the AI due to some brand new services to innovate, to deliver more value than customer expected. That's where we can monetize to lever the AI technology. That's why we keep investing more. Again, the goal is about some brand new AI services like Zoom a lot of other services we are going to build it down the road. So stay tuned for the Zoomtopia. Thank you. Yeah, Matt. It's a great question. First of all, I can tell you, take a Zoom Phone for example. We already deployed the Contact Center Zoom since a year ago, right? And our support team are very happy about our own deployment. It works extremely well, right? Because all those innovations and integrations on customers, right, for sure a loss of innovations every quarter. But the brand recognition, right, it still -- will take some time. That's why quite often all the existing customers, they would likely deploy Zoom Contact Center integration very well with the Zoom Phone and also they a new use case like internal hyperdesk, IT hyperdesk as At the same time, we also have some Contact Center customers no have a Zoom Phone, they don't have a Zoom Meetings. They like a Contact Center. I think given the speed of innovation, I think we have a higher confidence not only SMB but also more and more customer when realize the value of Zoom and Zoom Contact Center, I think something similar to what we did for Zoom Phone as well, right? When we started on existing customer realize, wow, there's a huge value and why not a try or tested out Zoom Contact Center as well, right? So that's the pass for our \u2013 to further grow our Contact Center business. Thank you. Yeah. So speaking of differentiation, first of all, we built the Contact Center service from ground up, right? This is the new architecture and also video is part of that as well. AI as AI components, we invested in AI and also, at the same time, a seamless integration with other products as well. That's why we have a high confidence, right? And all like some other vendors there for a long, long time, right? And the architecture may not be modern and the performance, the quality and so on and so forth, right? However, how to make sure every Enterprise customer during their RV process, right? They do look at Zoom. When they look at Zoom, we have a higher confidence, we can't compete. And also, we just had a lot of innovations around the Workforce Management platform as well and essentially Zoom Content Center to become our full Contact Center suite. Not just one part, right? It's targeted SMB and Enterprise and also with AI, I think we are innovating very fast, right, to compete against any other cloud-based or on-prem based and Contact Center vendors. Yes. Sorry, go ahead -- yes. Thank you. Yeah. That's a wonderful question. So look at the Zoom platform, right, so not only do we have Meetings, right? So some people still sort of we're just a Meeting company [indiscernible] of a full company, right? For those customers, we deployed like Team Chat, USPS deployed Zoom Team Chat. A lot of companies deployed the Zoom Phone and Whiteboard Zoom Contact Center as well Scheduler and also the Zoom Clips. As we build more and more services, right, and essentially, when we double on our platform, how to look at everything from a customer perspective, how to add more value? Let's take a Zoom One, for example. Customers say, I really like Zoom, already paid a platform. A lot of features to take this generative features like Meeting summary and to leverage GenAI to Team Chat and meeting inquiry and let's say, you are late to the meeting, how to get a quick real-time summary about what had been discussed over the past 5 minutes. All those GenAI features can make the entire platform, not only sticky, but also more value, right? So quite often, some customers say, yes, you can charge and some other competitors do that. We are taking a different approach. We think if you add more value to customers, and they are doing more -- were likely to move on to our entire platform, right? It does not mean we cannot monetize AI. How do you think about AI to build new services, right? [indiscernible] one example. Back to 1995, 1996, I mean Internet was sort of born, when every -- let's say, the stores, right, when they Internet, you do not want to increase the price, right? You buy online, why increase price? However, you can have the Internet to build new services, right, new innovations. That's why we're taking a different approach, not as some other competitors. They gave us free service AI, oh my god, they charge you a crazy price. I do not think that's fair to customers, right? And we are taking a different approach and more value to leverage GenAI to our existing customers focus on the future improvements to leverage GenAI. At the same time, given our speed of innovation, how to leverage GenAI to build some brand new AI services to monetize. That's our goal. That's our direction. That's our differentiated pricing strategy as well. Hopefully, my answer is clear. Otherwise, let's talk more at Zoomtopia. Appreciate it. Thank you. Yeah. I think Zoom Phone penetration is doing relatively well. But Zoom One, I think still we had a huge opportunity, right? Zoom one is not only for Zoom Meetings, the Phone, right? Also the Team Chat, if the customer wanted to deploy our free Team Chat solution and Whiteboard and a lot of other services, right, I think a huge opportunity, especially for medium and larger-sized customers and we needed to kind of share them the value. As I said earlier, about like GenAI features, all those kind of things is part of Zoom One, right? So leverage all those up, the cool features, right to penetrate more about Zoom One the market share, right? And Zoom Phone itself doing right at well, but a huge opportunity ahead of us for Zoom One penetration. And I will say we just started. I give one example. I take USPS, for example. When the reader is wow, you have a greater Team Chat solution is also part of Zoom One and also it's free. That's amazing, [indiscernible] why not deploy Zoom One, right? So many more customers when they realize the full potential of a Zoom One platform, I think that's the value, right? We need to do focus on. Thank you, Alex. Yeah, I can take a little bit more, Peter. So the question you asked was very similar to what about Zoom One. Actually, today, the problem is Zoom is a too strong brand on Meetings side, right, right? Many of the customers unfortunately, they even did not realize we have a lot of other services, not to mention a Zoom One platform, right? That's the number one challenge that we are facing. How to make sure all those \u2013 even existing \u2013 even for existing customers. They also think Zoom just a meeting, that's not the case, right? When we and share a greater story, make sure most of our customers are publicly realize our Zoom not only just the meetings had a full platform, I think the inflection point will not happen until then. Thank you. Thank you. Yes. Just quickly, when we talk with our customers, they really like we have a both -- they deploy both Zoom Meeting and Zoom Phone together. The Contact Center, a new opportunity, in particular, for those customers I think they don't want to deploy a point of solution, right? If you just have a Phone business, it's really hard to build a sustainable business customer Phone and Meetings, some of \u2013 they're very similarly integration, like you have a phone call, one more click and jump on the video meeting, right? So that's \u2013 that kind of a similar experience really helped us further our Phone growth, right? If you just offer a point of solution, it's really not scalable, not a sustainable. And down the road, more and more customers would like to move on platform play like a Zoom. Thank you. Yeah. So first of all, in terms of Online study. I know you have an account. Hopefully, you still have account. And for sure, it can contribute to our Online growth. So speaking about AI, I think we are taking a different approach. As I said earlier, from an architecture perspective, it's different, federated AI. In terms of monetization, right, again, we look at it how to leverage GenAI to improve our core Meeting experience and deliver more value, make the services more sticky Zoom always offer more and more features values. And at the same time, we do not kind of charge price, increase the price a lot at all, right? That's right, we build a trust. They want to go to for Zoom Phone platform. At the same time, GenAI does bring huge opportunity like in terms of monetization, in terms of the new service. As I said earlier, how to leverage GenAI to build some branded new service. You cannot only turn on low-hanging fruits. You already deployed this service. I have a GenAI feature now, you need to pay crazy price. I do not think that's sustainable. A customer do not like it. right? That's our approach, how to leverage GenAI to make sure existing customer happy and leverage GenAI to build new services focused on innovation, innovation and innovation. That's our approach. Thank you, Sterling. Yeah. Great question. So yes, speaking of go-to-market, I think on product front, we have a high, high confidence innovation speed, we have so many features and Workforce Management, a lot of other features are being introduced every quarter. In terms of go-to-market, I think not like what we did before for Meetings, right, by and large, more like primarily driven by [indiscernible] business, Contact Center is different. For sure, we need to double down, triple down on the indirect channel, right, embrace all the sort of partners and master agent and so on so forth. And we need to invest more on that front. And essentially, this is one of the things why not like Zoom Phone [indiscernible] accelerated revenue, but even have a greater Contact Center product. As you see the progress on go-to market front, I think that we will see the great result. And in terms of AI, not like other vendors, right, they already have Contact Center solution for a long, long time. When you look at AI kind of architecture and flexible, right, how to add AI to that to all those existing leaders the Contact Center. We already realized the importance of AI, right? That's why we have a very flexible architecture. Not only do we build organic AI features but also acquired Solvvy and also the Virtual Agent and so on and so forth. Organic growth and also the acquisition certainly help us a lot in terms of product innovation. And AI is going to put a big look for the Contact Center. We have higher confidence we can do very well on that front. Thank you all for joining us for the Q2 earnings call. I really appreciate for your great support and very, very beautiful. And thank you. Appreciate. Thank you."

And now, I will hand things over to Tom McCallum, Head of Investor Relations. Tom, over to you.\nTom McCallum: Thank you, Kelcey. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Zoom's earnings video webinar for the first quarter of fiscal year 2024. I\u2019m joined today by Zoom\u2019s Founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, and Zoom\u2019s CFO, Kelly Steckelberg. Our earnings press release was issued today after the market closed and may be downloaded from the Investor Relations page at investors.zoom.us. Also, on this page you'll be able to find a copy of today's prepared remarks and a slide deck with financial highlights that, along with our earnings release, include a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial results. During this call, we will make forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our financial outlook for the first -- for second quarter and full fiscal year 2024; our expectations regarding financial and business trends; impacts from the macroeconomic environment, our market position, opportunities, go-to-market initiatives, growth strategy and business aspirations; and product initiatives and the expected benefits of such initiatives. These statements are only predictions that are based on what we believe today, and actual results may differ materially. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and other factors that could affect our performance and financial results, which we discuss in detail in our filings with the SEC, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. Zoom assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that we may make on today\u2019s webinar. And with that, let me turn the discussion over to Eric.\nEric Yuan: Hey. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, everyone for joining us today. As we continue to execute on the strategic focuses, which I shared with you our last quarter, we are very grateful for the support, feedback and trust that we have received from our customers and investors. Last month, we closed our acquisition of Workvivo, which we are super excited about. Workvivo is a modern employee communication and engagement platform. Their solution combines a social intranet and employee app into one central hub, forming the heart of a company's digital ecosystem. Incorporating Workvivo's feature-rich technology into our all-in-one collaboration solution will allow us to offer Zoom customers, a unified platform that keeps knowledge workers and frontline employees informed, engaged, and connected throughout the workday, regardless of in-person, remote, or hybrid work style. According to Enterprise Apps Today, communicative employers have mobile workers who are 5 times more productive and feel 3 times less burned out. The Workvivo team is working very hard to capitalize on this opportunity and is 100% aligned with our culture of delivering happiness to customers and employees. We are so excited to join forces with Workvivo and help our customers raise the bar for employee communication and engagement. Last quarter, we reiterated our strong positioning in AI, and highlighted our expanded vision to see generative AI permeate and elevate productivity across our portfolio. In Q1, we made considerable progress towards that vision. We outlined our approach to AI is to drive forward solutions that are federated, empowering and responsible. Federated means flexible and customizable to businesses\u2019 unique scenarios and nomenclature. Empowering refers to building solutions that improve individual and team productivity as well as enhance the customer experience. And responsible means customer control of their data with an emphasis on privacy, security, trust and safety. At Enterprise Connect, we unveiled ZoomIQ\u2019s new set of in-beta features leveraging generative AI to support Chat and Email compose, and meeting summary. We are also building new features to summarize long chat threads, catch up tardy meeting participants on what they missed, and brainstorm in Whiteboard. Last week, we announced our strategic investment in Anthropic, an AI safety and research company working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. Our partnership with Anthropic further bolsters our federated approach to AI by allowing Anthropic\u2019s AI assistant, Claude, to be integrated across Zoom\u2019s entire platform. We plan to begin by layering Claude into our Contact Center portfolio, which includes Zoom Contact Center, Zoom Virtual Agent, and now in-beta Zoom Workforce Engagement Management. With Claude guiding agents toward trustworthy resolutions and powering self-service for end-users, companies will be able to take customer relationships to the next level. Now moving on to some of our customer wins. I would like to thank Major League Baseball. MLB has long used the power of the broader Zoom Platform to strengthen its connection to fans and teams. And this quarter, we expanded our relationship by launching a first-of-its-kind partnership that leverages Zoom Contact Center to enhance real-time replay reviews and deliver increased transparency to baseball fans. By introducing Zoom technologies into operations on and off the field, MLB strives to create an engaging and unique experience for its fans and teams. I would like to thank Virginia Tech for expanding our relationship by adding more than 10,000 Zoom Phone seats as well as Zoom Contact Center to their Zoom Meetings deployment. We brought responsiveness, reliability and regulatory compliance to this large expansion and Virginia Tech leverage Zoom\u2019s unified communications platform to build a next-gen solution integrated across meetings, phone and contact center, to serve the entire university community. I would also like to thank Vensure Employer Services, which has grown its workforce significantly the past few years through hiring and M&A. In Q1, Vensure expanded their existing footprint with us by adding approximately 10,000 Zoom Phone Seats and 800 Zoom Contact Center seats, as well as our AI-powered Zoom Virtual Agent and Zoom IQ for sales. It is so exciting to see customers leverage our natively integrated Phone plus Contact Center solutions and invest in our next generation AI-enabled products across their businesses. Finally, I want to thank My Plan Manager, Australia's leading services provider for the National Disability Insurance Program. MPM chose Zoom Contact Center for its attractive total cost of ownership, the deep integration with salesforce, and the vision and future roadmap for customer experience. And our journey did not end with Contact Center. Appreciating the value of the platform, they also decided to standardize on Zoom One. We are so happy to partner with MPM to help them deliver a world-class customer and employee experience to their clients and disability service providers. Again, thank you so much MLB, Virginia Tech, Vensure Services, MPM, and all of our customers worldwide. And with that, I\u2019ll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you, Eric and hello, everyone. We are pleased that we beat our top-line and profitability guidance in Q1. Here are a few milestones: first, our non-GAAP gross margin of 80.5% exceeded our long term target; second, after adjusting for the three fewer days in the quarter, our Online revenue was slightly up sequentially; and last, the moment you have all been waiting for, Zoom Phone surpassed 10% of revenue in the quarter. In Q1, total revenue came in at $1.105 billion, up 3% year-over-year and 5% in constant currency. This result was approximately $20 million above the high end of our guidance. Our Enterprise business grew 13% year-over-year and represented 57% of total revenue, up from 52% a year ago. As I mentioned in the quarterly milestones, our Online business improved meaningfully in the quarter as it benefited from many initiatives including the price increase and buy flow optimization. In addition, we saw Online average monthly churn decrease to 3.1%, from 3.6% in Q1 of FY \u201823, and 3.4% last quarter. We are pleased that this part of our business is stabilizing sooner than expected. The number of Enterprise customers grew 9% year-over-year to approximately 215,900. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q1 came in at 112%. We saw 23% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 3,580 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 29% of revenue, up from 24% in Q1 of FY \u201823, and span diverse industries such as healthcare, education, government, and more. As expected, we did experience some distraction across the global sales team due to the previously announced headcount reduction and subsequent sales reorganization. Despite the distraction, our Americas revenue grew 8% year-over-year, while EMEA and APAC declined by 8% and 5%, respectively. The decline in EMEA was primarily attributable to the outsized impact of the headcount reduction due to local regulations prolonging the process, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the stronger dollar. The decline in APAC was primarily attributable to the stronger dollar. Moving on to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities, restructuring expenses, and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 80.5%, an improvement from 78.6% in Q1 of last year and 79.8% last quarter. We are pleased that we have achieved our long term target as we drove sequential improvement mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers. For FY \u201824, we still expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 79.5%, reflecting additional investments in new AI technologies. Research and development expense grew by 25% year-over-year to approximately $106 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 9.6% from 7.9% in Q1 of last year, reflecting our investments in expanding our product portfolio including Zoom Contact Center, AI, and more. Looking ahead, innovation will remain a top priority for Zoom. Sales and marketing expense grew by 4% year-over-year to $278 million. This represented approximately 25.2% of total revenue, up from 24.9% in Q1 of last year. G&A expense declined by 10% to $84 million or approximately 7.6% of total revenue, down from 8.6% in Q1 of last year, as we focused on achieving greater back office efficiencies and savings. Non-GAAP operating income expanded to $422 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $379 million. This translates to a 38.2% non-GAAP operating margin, an improvement from 37.2% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.16, on approximately 304 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.18 above the high end of our guidance and 13% higher than Q1 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.4 billion, up 3% year-over-year from $1.3 billion. This is slightly above our guidance and primarily driven by renewals during our largest seasonal renewal quarter. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $3.5 billion, up 16% year-over-year from $3 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 59% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 63% in Q1 of FY \u201823 and 56% in Q4 of FY \u201823. The sequential increase in current RPO as a percentage of total RPO was primarily due to shorter contract durations in recent Enterprise deals arising from uncertainty in the macro environment. We expect Q2 deferred revenue to be down 2% to 4% year-over-year, which takes into account the recent trend of shorter durations on Enterprise deals and our renewal seasonality, which peaks in Q1 and declines throughout the year. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $418 million, as compared to $526 million in Q1 of last year. Free cash flow was $397 million, as compared to $501 million in Q1 of last year. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow margins were 37.9% and 35.9%, respectively. Due to a net legal settlement expected to occur later this year, we are revising our cash flow outlook for FY \u201824. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.19 billion. In FY \u201824 and going forward, we expect our smallest cash tax payments to occur in Q1, and the largest to occur in Q2. Now, turning to guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.11 billion to $1.115 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 1% year-over-year growth, or 2% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $405 million to $410 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.04 to $1.06 based on approximately 307 million shares outstanding. As our Online business is stabilizing, we wanted to give you all some additional one-time color on how we see it playing out in the coming quarters. We expect our Online revenues to be approximately $480 million in Q2 and be relatively flat thereafter in FY \u201824. We are pleased to raise our top-line and profitability outlook for the full year of FY \u201824. We now expect revenues to be in the range of $4.465 billion to $4.485 billion, which at the midpoint represents approximately 2% year-over-year growth, or 3% in constant currency. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.63 billion to $1.65 billion, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 37%. Our tax rate is expected to approximate the U.S. federal and both state blended rate. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $4.25 to $4.31, based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. As we look to reignite growth and maintain strong profitability, we are committed to doing so in the right way. We are pleased to have recently issued our second ESG report, which includes additional data regarding our greenhouse gas emissions inventory, and recommits Zoom to achieving 100% renewable energy for our direct operations by 2030. Our core value of care is as important as ever. It\u2019s embedded in how our product fosters emissions reductions, while supporting inclusiveness. It is also evident in our corporate and employee giving. You heard it from Eric. We are innovating extremely quickly to bring our customers the immense benefits of generative AI and empower modern collaboration. We are trusted and loved by our amazing and diverse set of customers. And we are fortunate to be one of the most recognized brands in the world. In Q1, we made some very tough decisions related to team size, structure and incentives that have understandably caused distraction in the short term, but at the same time exemplify our commitment to long-term growth and profitability. With a focus on the future, we have refreshed our mission and vision: One platform delivering limitless human connection. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors. With that, Kelcey, please queue up our first question.\nA - Kelcey McKinley: Thank you so much, Kelly. As Kelly mentioned, we will now move into the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Goldman Sachs' Kash Rangan. Kash, go ahead and come on video for us and unmute if you would, please. All right. Well, hearing no response. We'll go ahead and move on to Meta Marshall with Morgan Stanley.\nMeta Marshall: All right. I think I got mine to work. Perfect. Appreciate it. I noted that you were taking down kind of -- or not taking down, but giving back some of the gross margin upside that you saw in the quarter and noted that, that was for some of your AI investments. Eric, I guess I'm just wondering, how you're judging kind of build versus buy when it comes to AI or just where to leverage kind of the ecosystem of AI development that's going on versus investments that you want to make? Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Good question. I think it looks like everyone seem to have just woken up to AI. Actually, we have been busy on AI front for a few years, if you look at the past several \u2013 two of the largest acquisitions, right, Solvvy and Kites, right, all of the AI-based. Internally, we also have AI team as well because we understand the importance of AI in particular during recently by the generative AI momentum. I think, first of all, we do have our own AI team. We have our own internally developed AI models as well. We also will take up a very open approach. Essentially, we announced our federated approach to AI. We announced the collaboration with the Open AI, Enterprise Connect. We also doubled on our partnership with Anthropic recently as well and down the road maybe some open source AI models available, we are also going to embrace that. Again, we look at everything from end user perspective, right? First of all, we have a team really dedicated on AI. And also, when we sit down with the customers, some customers say, yes, really like Anthropic model. Yes, why not. We doubled on that partnership, we know we can leverage their API as well, right? So we are taking a federated approach which is to put a customer centric, right? That's why we are very, very excited about this AI momentum can truly improve our product experience.\nMeta Marshall: All right. Thanks.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: And moving on to Michael Funk with Bank of America.\nMichael Funk: Yes. Hi. Thank you, guys. Another question for you, Eric, if I could. Some more detail on how you think about AI integrating into your own platform. Do you think about it more as an enhancement or as a separate SKU? And then how do you monetize AI within your platform?\nEric Yuan: It's a good question. I would say the answer is about both. You take our Zoom IQ for sales, for example, right? It's extremely important, right? When you send all the salespeople back at the home or work remotely, how to help them to improve their productivity. That's the reason why we announced the Zoom IQ for sales and even way before the generative AI momentum, right? And internally developed large language models really help us, right? We can monetize that AI empowered Zoom IQ for sales product. At the same time, you look at our feature-rich collaboration portfolio, like a meeting summary, the e-mail and compose a chat message and Zoom Contact Center and Virtual Agent and also recently in beta, right, Workforce Management Solution as well, all of them will be empowered based on AI, the platform, right? So on the one hand, we leverage AI to look at almost every features we have to empower those features and also elevate the customer -- the product experience. At the same time, a lot of monetization opportunities, right? Zoom IQ for sales is just one example, right, as a real more opportunity for us. Again, we think AI does bring tremendous opportunity for us because we focus on communication, I think Workvivo, for example, right, we just acquired them in the employee communication and engagement [Indiscernible], how to leverage AI to improve that product experience that is another example. Again, full of opportunities here at Zoom with AI.\nMichael Funk: Great. Thank you, Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: All right. So let's go to Kash again with Goldman Sachs. Kash, I think you're out there driving, so he's going to stay off video.\nKasthuri Rangan: Exactly. Thank you very much. I appreciate you watching out for my safety. But just so you know that I'm not a bot, I'm a human. I just will turn on that video very quickly on. So Eric, I'm curious to get your take. So I want you to, if you don't mind, drill a little bit deeper to generative AI and while a lot of software companies are announcing partnerships with LLMs based on the content and data that they uniquely process, we're also at a point where many companies are identifying very unique workflows and productivity scenarios that differentiate them going forward, right? So in that regard, just so there's a scenario everybody in UCaaS will ultimately have a generative AI strategy. So when you start to have these LLMs work with your core products and given the vast user base and behaviors that you've contained in your knowledge base, how do you think Zoom is uniquely qualified to get productivity scenarios that are very unique to Zoom? Sorry for using the same word again, that could be more enduring as a source of competitive advantage because the first chapter of UCaaS was all about providing the core capability of the technology, which you did an amazing job of but I'm curious, the next leg of productivity growth and how you can take this company forward? Thanks so much.\nEric Yuan: Yes. Good questions. We have a great integration with the Tesla cars, right? If you use drive a Tesla, just one click and join the call. Even if you can\u2019t come over the video, the audio will be always on anyway. So back to your AI question, I think, first of all, if you look at the generative AI, two things is very important, right? So first of all, if you do not start years back, just given what's going on in AI industry, AI world, you say, oh my god, a lot of things. However, we already started investing in AI, a few years back. We should understand that. The reason why our Zoom IQ for sales was developed based on our own internally developed large language models. Having said that, there are two things really important. One is just the model, right? Open AI has modeled Anthropic and Facebook as well, Google and those companies. But most important thing is, how to leverage these modules to fine-tune based on your proprietary data, right? That is extremely important. When it comes to collaboration, communication, right? Take a Zoom Employee, for example. We have so many meetings, right, and talk about every day, like our Sales team use the Zoom call with the customers. We accumulate a lot of, let's say, internal meeting data. How to fine tune the model with this data. It's very important, right? Not only just for the AI model itself because it will evolve for sure and also we're also going to embrace. At the same time, how to leverage our proprietary data to fine-tune these AI models towards our industry, that's very important. Look at -- take a meeting, for example, right? I think that this is probably we have way more data than anybody else, right, given all the past many years\u2019 experience, how to fine tune that model with those data. And I think this is our unique -- will help us to deliver unique experience to customers. If any other company, you may have, let's say, you have a greater AI model, however, how to fine-tune it. It's a lot of effort, right? That's the reason why we think that's something unique for us to truly empower AI to deliver a differentiated experience to our customers.\nKasthuri Rangan: Thank you so much Eric.\nEric Yuan: Thank you. Appreciate it.\nKelcey McKinley: So sorry, please continue. Okay. We'll move on to Tom Blakey with KeyBanc.\nThomas Blakey: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Kelly and Eric, good to see you guys. There are some - a large competitor of yours has been the news lately with Microsoft possibly needing to create a separate SKU for their teams -- Team's product in terms of debundling that product. I know how important the collaboration component is to Zoom's vision of becoming the communications operating system for large enterprises and just noting with Kelly's updated color in terms of Online with that -- with the Online business stabilizing, which is great. The implied guide for the enterprise business is for pretty good decel into the second half. So just wondering, how Zoom is thinking about, if at all, the potential impact or opportunity there just to get an understanding of the importance of the collaboration component to your product? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: As we noted, we talked about earlier in the quarter, I don't think that the adjustment that you're seeing is necessarily related to competition and more due to as we expected, some distraction internally due to the reorganization, but we feel great about the structure of our sales organization now with Graham, especially as our Chief Sales Officer; and Wendy leading the online team and that we've made the hard decisions to get them focused and ready now to execute for the rest of the year. And we're just looking forward to seeing that come to light over the next couple of quarters.\nThomas Blakey: Okay. Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: Our next question will come from Parker Lane with Stifel.\nParker Lane: Yeah, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Kelly, I was hoping you could give us a better understanding of just how -- to what degree contract duration is actually compressed during the quarter? How much that will be an impact as we progress through the year? Is that more of a factor in any particular product set or was it pretty much across the board?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. It was pretty uniformly across our direct segment of the business, especially [Technical Difficulty] thing to be thoughtful about every decision, which is every buying decision, I should say, which is not new. It's just taking -- giving themselves time to make sure that they are getting the product deployed, and we expect it to be not long term in nature. But in order to reflect that, we updated our guidance based on, as we talked about deferred revenue as well for the coming quarter.\nParker Lane: Got it. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: We will now hear from Peter Levine with Evercore.\nKelly Steckelberg: Hi, Peter.\nPeter Levine: Thank you for taking my question. Maybe, Eric, one for you is when you think about the use case of AI and you think across like phone, video, contact center, where do you envision seeing the most kind of uplift in terms of client adoption of AI? Just curious to know where you're seeing that today.\nEric Yuan: I think on many fronts, right, like take Anthropic investing, for example, right? For sure, we are going to lever that not only for the entire portfolio, but we are going to start from a contact center, the virtual agent and the contracts and the related features. We also look at our core meeting platform, right, in meeting summary. It is extremely important, right? And it's also we have our team chat solution and also how to lever that to compose a chat. Remember, last year, we also have email candidate as well. How do we leverage the generative AI to understand the context, right, and kind of bring all the information relative to you and help you also generate the message, right? When you send an e-mail back to customers or prospects, right, either China message or e-mail, right? We can lever to generate is, right? I think a lot of areas, even like you like say, maybe you might be later to the meeting, right? 10 minutes later, you joined the meeting. You really want to stand in what had happened, right? Can you get a quick summary over the positive minutes. Yeah. You just also have to generate AI as well. You also can get that as well. It's kind of almost a lot of key use cases, right? I think will be empowered by those AI capabilities. That's why we are looking at almost every area, right, how to leverage generate to improve that experience. We take an Open AI, for example. This is a great company and also a lot of companies are leveraging their AI, not only bigger companies, small companies, we also announced the collaboration with them at Enterprise Connect, right? So that's why, as I said earlier, three things, right? You understand the large lung model, how to fine tune that with your own data and also revisit almost every feature you have -- are there any ways to empower those features? Are there any ways to monetize. That's why we take a holistic approach and also we like our federated approach to AI. By the way, internally, we do have AI team. It should understand the large language models. It's not something other companies just have work for AI.\nPeter Levine: Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: I'm moving on to Rishi Jaluria with RBC.\nRishi Jaluria: All right. Wonderful. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Eric, I want to stay on the AI train for a little bit. You've obviously talked about some great use cases and feels like there's a big opportunity. I want to ask about maybe the potential to start to verticalize some of the AI solutions because it feels like you have a huge opportunity around distribution, doing things like adding AI tools on top of videos for video interviews and giving real-time signals, for example? And I'm sure that's one being discussed internally. So I just want to understand maybe how are you thinking about that opportunity to verticalize? And is that something that can make maybe direct monetization a little bit more easy because the value prop is very straight out of the box? Thank you.\nEric Yuan: That's a great question. By the way, I download the Open AI mobile iOS app, I should ask open ChatGPT to answer to another question. But anyway, you are so right on. When it comes vertical, I would say, the opportunity. There are two things. One is a departmental level, another one is a vertical industry, right? You look at our Zoom IQ for Sales specifically targeted sales use case or sales department, right? Contact Center is for supported part. You're so right, down the road HR department in marketing, almost every department, they all use Zoom, right? How to leverage AI to build a differentiated solution, right? That is the opportunity. That's one opportunity. Another opportunity really about the vertical industry. Take health care, for example. Zoom by far is number one on telemedicine, right? How to leverage that, right? And with those proprietary data, right, and also working together with the customers, right, and fine tune this AI model, right? This is one example. Another example is a lot of law firms are also using Zoom as well, right? And how to lever the AI to truly empower those use cases is also another opportunity. I think as I said earlier, AI truly brings tremendous opportunity to us. So we got to leverage that. The good news, we're already heavily invested in this area for a few years.\nRishi Jaluria: Awesome. Thank you so much.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: And our next question comes from Catharine Trebnick with Rosenblatt Securities.\nCatharine Trebnick: I got it. Thank you. All right. In the last two years, a lot of changes has happened. First, everybody worked from home and now people are going back to the office. So has that actually changed any of your opportunities when you're looking at marketing, your products. I was thinking in terms of Zoom Room and then some of the areas where you want everybody to be equal in your Zoom Room viewing. So has that changed anything? Have you seen anything different from that?\nEric Yuan: Good questions. Good news is a question not about AI anymore. So you're so right. I think that during the COVID, right, as a lot of consumer use cases, right? Almost every family, you have with company account like a Zoom account, right? After the COVID, I think if you look at the usage, right, consumer-centric usage, I think, less and less. But however, to support a hybrid work, enterprise customers, they are going to leverage the video content more and more, not only just to support remote work. When you try to support hybrid work, how to reserve a desk, all those basic features, right? How to make sure when you join the meeting from the comp room, right, remote people, they can't see you, right? Not only just big square, right? So everyone who are sitting in the comp room, equally, we have a square as well as Zoom Square, right? So those kind of experiences extremely important, right? A lot of features are built upon enabling hybrid work, right? Even Workvivo is not example, right? During the hybrid work, right? Quite often, you can chat, you use the e-mail or use the phone call, meetings. But sometimes also want to announce a very exciting news and record a video how to distribute those to employees and sometimes even to customers, that's the reason why we acquired Workvivo as well. I think hybrid work is going to stay. That's the reason why a lot of new use cases, right? How to double down on that. Take [Indiscernible], for example, we have the smart gallery view feature, right? Customers like that. However, in some cases, customers are still down to work. I have a huge conference room, how do you support that? That's the reason why we are working on supporting three cameras, right? That's another way to embrace hybrid work. I think the hybrid work does bring another kind of huge opportunity to us, especially it's hard to convince everyone back to office five days a week. Even for us, even if I talked with many CEOs. Everyone wanted, right, sometimes you want these employees more. But however, this is kind of to let employees work anywhere, it sort of become a fashion. It's hard to force employees back in the home. That's why you have to embrace hybrid work. That's the reason why Zoom can play a much bigger role to support the hybrid work.\nCatharine Trebnick: All right. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: And William Blair's Matt Stotler has the next question.\nMatthew Stotler: Yeah. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe just one on the contact center side. So you obviously continue to innovate on the product front for contact center. But last time, we got a deep update. There was still some honing that was needed on the go-to-market front. We'll just get an update on what you're seeing on that front, overall adoption of the Contact Center product suite? And then what you think are the keys to driving further adoption going forward?\nEric Yuan: Kelly, do you want to take it?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So our contact center leader is Scott Brown. He is a great addition to our team. And we are focusing from a go-to-market perspective now in the same way that we took Zoom Phone. We are hiring. We have some on board already, but we were hiring additional contact center specialists, who will act as an overlay team and be there to support the account executives to go in, as it's more of a technical sale and give them the opportunity to eventually over time, all become versed in how to sell Contact Center. So we're in the process of that today. And as I said, we've approved more reps. So we're excited about making the investment there.\nMatthew Stotler: Got it.\nKelly Steckelberg: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: Moving on to William Power with Baird.\nWilliam Power: Great. Thanks. Yeah. I want to ask a question on Online. It's great to see that segment play stabilizing. Maybe kind of two parts tied to that. Any early color with respect to the price increases and what you're seeing out of that? And as you look forward for the guidance for online, maybe just some broader framework for how you're thinking about both churn and top of funnel what gives you the confidence on both those fronts that this really is going to stabilize here?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So we've seen a very positive reaction to the price increase. The -- when we came into the year and we were modeling it, we've actually seen better-than-expected retention rates in response to that. So that's been really great. As well as -- when he's done a lot of work around the online buy flow, which has also seen a very positive response. And then we've talked about it in the past, but there's a whole road map of other initiatives that are being worked on and continues to be added, including things like additional payment currencies, additional payment types and additional offerings. So those are all the top-of-the-funnel items you're referring to. And then they've also done a lot of work to the flow when people -- the cancellation flow when people come through, which is also contributing to the improved retention rates, and we feel great about them. Now they've been, it was 3.1% in Q3, 3.4% in Q4 and now 3.1% again or maybe -- yeah, 3.4% and we were born now back to 3.1% again in Q1. And as we said, we expect Q2 and Q4 to be seasonally higher quarters due to the holidays in those periods and the flexibility we give our customers to come and go as they need the product. So the churn we're very pleased with, and we've seen the behavior expect exactly as we expected it coming back down in Q1. So that gives us confidence that it's going to be within that range for the foreseeable future.\nEric Yuan: By the way, just quickly to add on what the Kelly said, right? So as we add more and more new services also can help us more upsell opportunities even for online segment. take the Zoom Schedule, for example, we announced that new service, right? And some customers already paid for other services like [indiscernible] right? Customers, yeah, I'd like it to go with Zoom, deploy something similar, right? It's a part of the package, right? I think a lot of upsell opportunities for us to target the Online segment as well.\nKelcey McKinley: Thanks, William. And moving on to Siti Panigrahi with Mizuho.\nSitikantha Panigrahi: Thanks for taking my question. Eric, when you -- I just want to dig into this Workvivo acquisition. Do you see that more of a long-term opportunity or do you see that something that we can think of, this is some sort of technology that you can cross-sell into their base in near term? And what sort of -- is there some particular vertical or in a segment where you can see more traction there? Could you give some little bit elaborate in terms of revenue opportunity from that?\nEric Yuan: Yes. Good question. So first of all, if you look at our collaboration platform, right? We really want to offer a unified communication and collaboration platform. Customers I can leave it in the room platform, right? I think today is one of the problems we are facing customer also mention for us as well, right? Quite often, we send all kind of message either to e-mail, it's really hard to find, not scalable or you send message to chat, bar all those public channels, right? Customers also wanted to essentially like see a video message, right? I want to share to the entire employee base and a maybe a department of news, right? All those kind of accounting, right? Are there any other better ways to share and engage these employee, right? I think that's the reason why we think Workvivo can play a bigger role right to put on those kind of use cases, right? It's not only for the short term, is a key missing element of our entire product portfolio, but also in the long run, also is will help us a lot because of the AI, right, because how do you make sure you have more data, right, and really collaborating communication-related data, right? It's Workvivo for sure. Every day we use engaged with our employees, we are -- what we platform, you will generate lots of data, right? All those are very, I would say, is relevant and meaningful, right? How to lever the AI, right? That's why in the long run, certainly it can help us more.\nSitikantha Panigrahi: Great. Thank you.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: Next question will come from George Iwanyc with Oppenheimer.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you for taking my question. Kelly, maybe building on the stabilization you've seen on the online side. Can you give us a sense of what your expectations are from an expansion rate on the enterprise side as you look out over the next couple of quarters?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. We don't guide specifically around the expansion rate. But as a reminder, it is a trailing 12-month metric. So given that it's at 112% and you can look at where the enterprise growth rate is that possibly has the opportunity to come down slightly more until it starts to reaccelerate as we expect gold online and direct revenue to start reaccelerating as we get to the back half of this year and that the net dollar expansion rate is going to trail behind that.\nGeorge Iwanyc: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: Wolfe Research\u2019s' Alex Zukin will have the next question.\nAlex Zukin: Hey, guys. Can you hear me, okay.\nKelcey McKinley: Hi, Alex.\nAlex Zukin: So I guess I'll try kind of a two-parter. One is just a simple how do you plan to monetize generative AI functionality in the product rather than making it making it a part of the overall experience? And the second is from an enterprise revenue growth perspective, I think the rate of decel being contemplated from the mid-20s last year in the first half to just over 5% of the second quarter guidance implied. That's a much larger rate of diesel than I think we all contemplated or thought. So how do we -- like is it an upsell? Is it cross-sell? Is it new products that are launching? Is it later revenue recognition? Like what is it that's driven that rate of decel? And how do you reaccelerate obviously, but how do you get back to a double-digit growth rate in that regard because it seems like that's where a lot of the valuation oomph is coming from for the stock?\nEric Yuan: So Kelly, I'll address the first one, you take the second one. I think in terms of how to monetize generative AI. I think first of all, take Zoom IQ for Sales for example, that's a new service to target for the sales deportment. That AI technology is based on generative AI, right, so we can monetize. And also seeing some features, even before the general AI popularity, we have a live transmission feature, right? And also, that's not a free feature. It is a paid feature, right, behind the paywall, right? And also a lot of good features, right, take the Zoom meeting summary, for example, for enterprise -- and the customers, if you deploy Zoom One, deploys why do we have those features, right? For to customers, see three, all those SMB customers, they did not deploy Zoom One. They may not get to those features, right? That's the reason -- another reason for us to monetize. I think there's multiple ways to monetize, yes.\nKelly Steckelberg: And then in terms of the enterprise outlook, as I mentioned earlier, we expected the distraction in Q1 as there was impact to the sales or not only from the reduction, but also reorganization. And we feel really good about the structure of the sales organization now. And we've also, as I mentioned, we are prioritizing where we want to continue to invest and just recently committed to adding more reps in the contact center team for example. We hired a leader in Europe, which we haven't had before. So really excited to have Frederic join us. And all of these put us -- to bring us to be very well positioned to execute for the rest of the year. And now we're looking to the sales team to do exactly that. And they -- we talked about we have an amazing platform that's there for them to sell, and we're all rallying behind them to support them to see them execute.\nAlex Zukin: Perfect. Thank you, guys.\nEric Yuan: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: And moving on to Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo.\nMichael Turrin: Hey, there. Thanks. Good to see everyone. Kelly, on the billings deferred revenue side, you came in a little bit ahead of what you were guiding for a few percentage points from last quarter despite some duration impact. So I'm wondering, if there's any way you can help us quantify those duration impacts either on Q1 or the Q2 guide? And anything else you can provide just to help us think through seasonality as you've now passed the heavier renewal period, but mentioned maybe some sales transition impacts still out there. Just help us think through just what's contemplated in the guide from a few different levels. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. So I think on the billing duration impact. As I said earlier, we don't expect this to be a long-term impact. We think it's just indicative of some of the uncertainty that's in the macro environment today. And just watching and being thoughtful about the impact that it's having on deferred and then you also heard it in terms of RPO. But we've seen this impact before, and we've also seen customers come back then. And I think especially as we continue moving towards more bundles, Zoom One, Contact Centers and Zoom Phone, those are all products that customers are going to commit to for the longer term. So I think as you continue to see more and more of those in our pipeline and being sold by the enterprise team, that, that duration impact will start to expand again. And then in terms of the balance between enterprise and online, we're thrilled that enterprise has stabilized a little bit earlier than we expected. Given the days in the month -- the days of the quarter, that's why we gave a more view because it's a little bit tricky when you look at it for the rest of the year. And the guidance contemplates all the things that we already talked about in terms of the pipeline and all the initiatives the online team is working on. And then, of course, the restabilization, if you will, of our direct sales work at the same time.\nMichael Turrin: Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: And Ryan MacWilliams with Barclays has the next question.\nRyan MacWilliams: Great. Appreciate it, guys. And congrats on Zoom Phone reaching 10% of sales. So just thinking back a few years, pretty amazing that this metric only came after reaching 5 million phone sales, so quite the run. Look, I love all that questions so far, but I guess I'll just ask the boring macro question. Kelly, are you seeing any differences in the impact of macro to the Online segment versus the Enterprise segment? And have you seen any changes at renewal on the enterprise side, maybe from an enterprise logo like churn standpoint? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: No. So our enterprise renewals, as you know, Q1 is our highest seasonal quarter and the renewals were exactly in the range of where we expected them to be for the quarter, so that was really great to see. And then in terms of Online, where we've seen strength that we've already talked about, I think it's increasing the top of the funnel. We've also continued to see strength in annual plans, which is great. And this is due to the -- just as a reminder, when we did the price increase, we didn't increase the price for the annual plan. So it just shows customers committing to the amazing value that they see in Zoom and the discounts that they get for committing to the long term, but of course, that's amazing for us because the lifetime value of those annual customers is so much greater.\nRyan MacWilliams: Thanks for the color. Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: Patrick Walravens with JMP Securities has the next question. I'm not sure he's out there, Patrick, do you want to come off mute and start your video for us? All right. Hearing no response...\nPatrick Walravens: I'll come off mute. I'm going to turn off the video and you can see why? Eric, can you talk to us a little bit about sort of the [Technical Difficulty] and what part of that is appealing to investors?\nKelcey McKinley: Patrick, so sorry, your audio is cutting out for us. Will you try one more time? And unfortunately, we might have to skip you if it doesn't improve, but try again, please.\nPatrick Walravens: Eric, can you just talk a little bit more about Anthropic and what they believe come with it?\nEric Yuan: Sure.\nKelly Steckelberg: I heard Anthropic.\nEric Yuan: Yeah. I think Anthropic is a great partner, and this is a great team. And when we look at the AI landscape, I think why not double down on that partnership, right? And given our federal AI approach, right, internally we discussed that happened to be in the middle of using another round of financing, right? That's why how to solidify our partnership, right? Again, they are a great team, greater technology. And I think this is no brainer for us, we invest in them to further solidify the partnership. And yeah, so that's pretty much because look at our contact center, right, we will further empower our contact center offering, right, and also download applied to an entire product portfolio. Again, this is very important to our federated approach to AI, and that's the reason why you invested in them.\nKelcey McKinley: Thanks, Patrick. We'll go ahead and move on to Matthew Niknam with Deutsche Bank.\nMatthew Niknam: Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Just two quick ones on cash flow maybe for Kelly. First, accounts receivable the last two years, it's been about a drag of $80 million this quarter, much better, only about $29 million, wondering what changed there in terms of cash collections? And then secondly, in terms of this legal settlement, if you can just quantify and let us know maybe when we should anticipate that? Thanks.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah. In terms of the settlement, Matthew, we -- it's not clear exactly when that will be completed in terms of the payment. That's why we said for the full year, we're updating it could be in Q2, it could also be in Q3. That's why we just wanted to give you visibility into that. And then, in terms of your first point about collections. I think part of that, honestly, is just the continued improvement that we're seeing in our team around collections and our ongoing DSOs and also, as we've seen online, when there's more online, especially annual, that is the online is mostly paid via credit card. So that is an improvement in terms of our DSOs usually as that's growing because the DSOs on online are about three days. Does that help?\nMatthew Niknam: And the legal settlement, if you could just quantify how much that is?\nKelly Steckelberg: It's exactly the amount of the difference between our previous guidance. Let me say it this way, there was no other change to our cash flow outlook other than the anticipated potential net legal settlement.\nMatthew Niknam: All right. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nKelcey McKinley: Shebly Seyrafi with FBN Securities has the next question.\nShebly Seyrafi: Yeah. Thank you very much. So you're implicitly guiding for your enterprise growth rate to decelerate to something like 6% in Q2 and maybe 3% to 4% in the back half. It was only double-digits in the past. So I know you have a lot of changes this year with the sales force, et cetera. After this year, or do you target double-digit growth in enterprise or is it like an upper single-digit growth rate? And also related, the Online business is stabilizing for the next few quarters, it looks like Q4, that means zero growth versus negative growth. Is it a growth business afterwards as well? So I'm just looking after this year is online a growth business is enterprise low double-digits or upper single-digit growth rate business.\nKelly Steckelberg: All the investments that we are making today are focused on growing the top line and investing in ways to do that for the future for both online and the direct business. So that's innovation. It's expanding our platform. It's focusing on investing in the go-to-market teams in terms of what we've talked about earlier, like the contact center, adding a leader to Europe, really focusing on marketing in the right way. And we haven't obviously given FY '25 guidance, but the goal is, and we've talked about before, starting to see reacceleration of growth as we exit FY '24 and having that continue into FY '25. And we're so early in the year of FY '24, but lining up everything to anticipate reacceleration as we exit the year.\nShebly Seyrafi: And the enterprise?\nKelly Steckelberg: Across -- potentially...\nShebly Seyrafi: I'm just saying the enterprise is it upper single digits or low double-digit growth rate, the way you're targeting it, not guiding, just targeting?\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah, I'm not going to get that specific, especially this early. We'll be prepared more great to talk about that later this year.\nShebly Seyrafi: Okay. Thank you.\nKelcey McKinley: And we'll move on to Karl Keirstead with UBS.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Great. Hey, Kelly. Just to follow on that conversation about driving for acceleration next year. And earlier on, you talked about innovation being a huge priority, that seems to me like there's the potential to shift a little bit the growth margin trade-off as you invest to drive growth. next year. I'm wondering if you're intending to signal that high 30s, 40% margins, everybody on the call should consider sort of a peak. And then if I could ask a clarification, did Workvivo impact at all your guidance for this year? Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes. Thank you, Karl. So as a quick reminder, our long-term target operating margin is lower, much lower than where we are operating today. And that is, as we've said in the past, to give us the opportunity as we see opportunities for investment to do so. We are really focused on doing everything we can to drive top line growth and continue to take market share. In the period of time where we've had slower growth, we've been focused on balancing that with profitability. But as we see opportunities, we absolutely could bring our margins down. So yes, I think we're at probably the peak of where our margins are. But again, we're always being very thoughtful about growth and profitability and balancing both of those. And then in terms of the Workvivo team, given they're amazing, and we're really excited about bringing them into the family, but they're having really, I would say, minimal impact on both the top line and the bottom line today.\nKarl Keirstead: Okay. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yes.\nKelcey McKinley: We have time for one additional question, which will come from Sterling Auty with Moffett Nathanson.\nSterling Auty: Great. Thanks, guys. Hopefully, my connection holds up. Just wondering back on the enterprise. Given the online $40 million a quarter stabilization. It implies the enterprises revenue is well below Street consensus. Did we analysts just have the mix model [Technical Difficulty] wrong or was the disruption or something having a bigger impact on the line -- on the enterprise business for the rest of the year?\nKelly Steckelberg: I think there's two things. I think first of all, we've seen online stabilize much more quickly than we anticipated or than we had been indicating to all of you. So I think the overall mix for the year is probably shaving up to be a little bit different than you anticipated and even a that we anticipated at the beginning of the year. And then we're doing -- as I said, we're doing everything we can to focus on supporting our direct sales organization. The distraction in was not de minimis, right? It was -- as I said, it was across not only the reduction but also a reorganization and some changes to incentives and comp plans. And so we're very happy that that's all behind us now, and we're all looking forward to do everything we can to support them and regain momentum there.\nSterling Auty: Sounds good. Thank you.\nKelly Steckelberg: Yeah.\nKelcey McKinley: And again, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. So I'll pass it back to you, Eric, for any closing or additional remarks.\nEric Yuan: Well, thank you all for your time. Really appreciate all your support, and thank you, as you all in our next meeting. I appreciate it. Cheers.\nKelly Steckelberg: Bye everyone.\nKelcey McKinley: Sorry, Kelly. And again, this does conclude today's earnings release. We thank you all for your participation. So go enjoy your summer, and we will see you next quarter.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Kelly Steckelberg",
            "content": "Thank you, Eric and hello, everyone. We are pleased that we beat our top-line and profitability guidance in Q1. Here are a few milestones: first, our non-GAAP gross margin of 80.5% exceeded our long term target; second, after adjusting for the three fewer days in the quarter, our Online revenue was slightly up sequentially; and last, the moment you have all been waiting for, Zoom Phone surpassed 10% of revenue in the quarter. In Q1, total revenue came in at $1.105 billion, up 3% year-over-year and 5% in constant currency. This result was approximately $20 million above the high end of our guidance. Our Enterprise business grew 13% year-over-year and represented 57% of total revenue, up from 52% a year ago. As I mentioned in the quarterly milestones, our Online business improved meaningfully in the quarter as it benefited from many initiatives including the price increase and buy flow optimization. In addition, we saw Online average monthly churn decrease to 3.1%, from 3.6% in Q1 of FY \u201823, and 3.4% last quarter. We are pleased that this part of our business is stabilizing sooner than expected. The number of Enterprise customers grew 9% year-over-year to approximately 215,900. Our trailing 12-month net dollar expansion rate for Enterprise customers in Q1 came in at 112%. We saw 23% year-over-year growth in the up-market as we ended the quarter with 3,580 customers contributing more than $100,000 in trailing 12 months revenue. These customers represent 29% of revenue, up from 24% in Q1 of FY \u201823, and span diverse industries such as healthcare, education, government, and more. As expected, we did experience some distraction across the global sales team due to the previously announced headcount reduction and subsequent sales reorganization. Despite the distraction, our Americas revenue grew 8% year-over-year, while EMEA and APAC declined by 8% and 5%, respectively. The decline in EMEA was primarily attributable to the outsized impact of the headcount reduction due to local regulations prolonging the process, the Russia-Ukraine war, and the stronger dollar. The decline in APAC was primarily attributable to the stronger dollar. Moving on to our non-GAAP results, which exclude stock-based compensation expense and associated payroll taxes, acquisition-related expenses, net litigation settlements, net gains or losses on strategic investments, undistributed earnings attributable to participating securities, restructuring expenses, and all associated tax effects. Non-GAAP gross margin in Q1 was 80.5%, an improvement from 78.6% in Q1 of last year and 79.8% last quarter. We are pleased that we have achieved our long term target as we drove sequential improvement mainly due to optimizing usage across the public cloud and our co-located data centers. For FY \u201824, we still expect non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 79.5%, reflecting additional investments in new AI technologies. Research and development expense grew by 25% year-over-year to approximately $106 million. As a percentage of total revenue, R&D expense increased to 9.6% from 7.9% in Q1 of last year, reflecting our investments in expanding our product portfolio including Zoom Contact Center, AI, and more. Looking ahead, innovation will remain a top priority for Zoom. Sales and marketing expense grew by 4% year-over-year to $278 million. This represented approximately 25.2% of total revenue, up from 24.9% in Q1 of last year. G&A expense declined by 10% to $84 million or approximately 7.6% of total revenue, down from 8.6% in Q1 of last year, as we focused on achieving greater back office efficiencies and savings. Non-GAAP operating income expanded to $422 million, exceeding the high end of our guidance of $379 million. This translates to a 38.2% non-GAAP operating margin, an improvement from 37.2% in Q1 of last year. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in Q1 was $1.16, on approximately 304 million non-GAAP diluted weighted average shares outstanding. This result was $0.18 above the high end of our guidance and 13% higher than Q1 of last year. Turning to the balance sheet. Deferred revenue at the end of the period was $1.4 billion, up 3% year-over-year from $1.3 billion. This is slightly above our guidance and primarily driven by renewals during our largest seasonal renewal quarter. Looking at both our billed and unbilled contracts, our RPO totaled approximately $3.5 billion, up 16% year-over-year from $3 billion. We expect to recognize approximately 59% of the total RPO as revenue over the next 12 months, as compared to 63% in Q1 of FY \u201823 and 56% in Q4 of FY \u201823. The sequential increase in current RPO as a percentage of total RPO was primarily due to shorter contract durations in recent Enterprise deals arising from uncertainty in the macro environment. We expect Q2 deferred revenue to be down 2% to 4% year-over-year, which takes into account the recent trend of shorter durations on Enterprise deals and our renewal seasonality, which peaks in Q1 and declines throughout the year. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, excluding restricted cash. We had operating cash flow in the quarter of $418 million, as compared to $526 million in Q1 of last year. Free cash flow was $397 million, as compared to $501 million in Q1 of last year. Our operating cash flow and free cash flow margins were 37.9% and 35.9%, respectively. Due to a net legal settlement expected to occur later this year, we are revising our cash flow outlook for FY \u201824. We now expect free cash flow to be in the range of $1.14 billion to $1.19 billion. In FY \u201824 and going forward, we expect our smallest cash tax payments to occur in Q1, and the largest to occur in Q2. Now, turning to guidance. For Q2, we expect revenue to be in the range of $1.11 billion to $1.115 billion, which at the midpoint would represent approximately 1% year-over-year growth, or 2% in constant currency. We expect non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $405 million to $410 million. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $1.04 to $1.06 based on approximately 307 million shares outstanding. As our Online business is stabilizing, we wanted to give you all some additional one-time color on how we see it playing out in the coming quarters. We expect our Online revenues to be approximately $480 million in Q2 and be relatively flat thereafter in FY \u201824. We are pleased to raise our top-line and profitability outlook for the full year of FY \u201824. We now expect revenues to be in the range of $4.465 billion to $4.485 billion, which at the midpoint represents approximately 2% year-over-year growth, or 3% in constant currency. We expect our non-GAAP operating income to be in the range of $1.63 billion to $1.65 billion, representing a non-GAAP operating margin of approximately 37%. Our tax rate is expected to approximate the U.S. federal and both state blended rate. Our outlook for non-GAAP earnings per share is $4.25 to $4.31, based on approximately 308 million shares outstanding. As we look to reignite growth and maintain strong profitability, we are committed to doing so in the right way. We are pleased to have recently issued our second ESG report, which includes additional data regarding our greenhouse gas emissions inventory, and recommits Zoom to achieving 100% renewable energy for our direct operations by 2030. Our core value of care is as important as ever. It's embedded in how our product fosters emissions reductions, while supporting inclusiveness. It is also evident in our corporate and employee giving. You heard it from Eric. We are innovating extremely quickly to bring our customers the immense benefits of generative AI and empower modern collaboration. We are trusted and loved by our amazing and diverse set of customers. And we are fortunate to be one of the most recognized brands in the world. In Q1, we made some very tough decisions related to team size, structure and incentives that have understandably caused distraction in the short term, but at the same time exemplify our commitment to long-term growth and profitability. With a focus on the future, we have refreshed our mission and vision: One platform delivering limitless human connection. Thank you to the entire Zoom team, our customers, our community, and our investors. With that, Kelcey, please queue up our first question. As we noted, we talked about earlier in the quarter, I don't think that the adjustment that you're seeing is necessarily related to competition and more due to as we expected, some distraction internally due to the reorganization, but we feel great about the structure of our sales organization now with Graham, especially as our Chief Sales Officer; and Wendy leading the online team and that we've made the hard decisions to get them focused and ready now to execute for the rest of the year. And we're just looking forward to seeing that come to light over the next couple of quarters. Yeah. It was pretty uniformly across our direct segment of the business, especially [Technical Difficulty] thing to be thoughtful about every decision, which is every buying decision, I should say, which is not new. It's just taking -- giving themselves time to make sure that they are getting the product deployed, and we expect it to be not long term in nature. But in order to reflect that, we updated our guidance based on, as we talked about deferred revenue as well for the coming quarter. Hi, Peter. Yeah. So our contact center leader is Scott Brown. He is a great addition to our team. And we are focusing from a go-to-market perspective now in the same way that we took Zoom Phone. We are hiring. We have some on board already, but we were hiring additional contact center specialists, who will act as an overlay team and be there to support the account executives to go in, as it's more of a technical sale and give them the opportunity to eventually over time, all become versed in how to sell Contact Center. So we're in the process of that today. And as I said, we've approved more reps. So we're excited about making the investment there. Thank you. Yeah. So we've seen a very positive reaction to the price increase. The -- when we came into the year and we were modeling it, we've actually seen better-than-expected retention rates in response to that. So that's been really great. As well as -- when he's done a lot of work around the online buy flow, which has also seen a very positive response. And then we've talked about it in the past, but there's a whole road map of other initiatives that are being worked on and continues to be added, including things like additional payment currencies, additional payment types and additional offerings. So those are all the top-of-the-funnel items you're referring to. And then they've also done a lot of work to the flow when people -- the cancellation flow when people come through, which is also contributing to the improved retention rates, and we feel great about them. Now they've been, it was 3.1% in Q3, 3.4% in Q4 and now 3.1% again or maybe -- yeah, 3.4% and we were born now back to 3.1% again in Q1. And as we said, we expect Q2 and Q4 to be seasonally higher quarters due to the holidays in those periods and the flexibility we give our customers to come and go as they need the product. So the churn we're very pleased with, and we've seen the behavior expect exactly as we expected it coming back down in Q1. So that gives us confidence that it's going to be within that range for the foreseeable future. Yeah. We don't guide specifically around the expansion rate. But as a reminder, it is a trailing 12-month metric. So given that it's at 112% and you can look at where the enterprise growth rate is that possibly has the opportunity to come down slightly more until it starts to reaccelerate as we expect gold online and direct revenue to start reaccelerating as we get to the back half of this year and that the net dollar expansion rate is going to trail behind that. And then in terms of the enterprise outlook, as I mentioned earlier, we expected the distraction in Q1 as there was impact to the sales or not only from the reduction, but also reorganization. And we feel really good about the structure of the sales organization now. And we've also, as I mentioned, we are prioritizing where we want to continue to invest and just recently committed to adding more reps in the contact center team for example. We hired a leader in Europe, which we haven't had before. So really excited to have Frederic join us. And all of these put us -- to bring us to be very well positioned to execute for the rest of the year. And now we're looking to the sales team to do exactly that. And they -- we talked about we have an amazing platform that's there for them to sell, and we're all rallying behind them to support them to see them execute. Yeah. So I think on the billing duration impact. As I said earlier, we don't expect this to be a long-term impact. We think it's just indicative of some of the uncertainty that's in the macro environment today. And just watching and being thoughtful about the impact that it's having on deferred and then you also heard it in terms of RPO. But we've seen this impact before, and we've also seen customers come back then. And I think especially as we continue moving towards more bundles, Zoom One, Contact Centers and Zoom Phone, those are all products that customers are going to commit to for the longer term. So I think as you continue to see more and more of those in our pipeline and being sold by the enterprise team, that, that duration impact will start to expand again. And then in terms of the balance between enterprise and online, we're thrilled that enterprise has stabilized a little bit earlier than we expected. Given the days in the month -- the days of the quarter, that's why we gave a more view because it's a little bit tricky when you look at it for the rest of the year. And the guidance contemplates all the things that we already talked about in terms of the pipeline and all the initiatives the online team is working on. And then, of course, the restabilization, if you will, of our direct sales work at the same time. No. So our enterprise renewals, as you know, Q1 is our highest seasonal quarter and the renewals were exactly in the range of where we expected them to be for the quarter, so that was really great to see. And then in terms of Online, where we've seen strength that we've already talked about, I think it's increasing the top of the funnel. We've also continued to see strength in annual plans, which is great. And this is due to the -- just as a reminder, when we did the price increase, we didn't increase the price for the annual plan. So it just shows customers committing to the amazing value that they see in Zoom and the discounts that they get for committing to the long term, but of course, that's amazing for us because the lifetime value of those annual customers is so much greater. I heard Anthropic. Yeah. In terms of the settlement, Matthew, we -- it's not clear exactly when that will be completed in terms of the payment. That's why we said for the full year, we're updating it could be in Q2, it could also be in Q3. That's why we just wanted to give you visibility into that. And then, in terms of your first point about collections. I think part of that, honestly, is just the continued improvement that we're seeing in our team around collections and our ongoing DSOs and also, as we've seen online, when there's more online, especially annual, that is the online is mostly paid via credit card. So that is an improvement in terms of our DSOs usually as that's growing because the DSOs on online are about three days. Does that help? It's exactly the amount of the difference between our previous guidance. Let me say it this way, there was no other change to our cash flow outlook other than the anticipated potential net legal settlement. Yeah. All the investments that we are making today are focused on growing the top line and investing in ways to do that for the future for both online and the direct business. So that's innovation. It's expanding our platform. It's focusing on investing in the go-to-market teams in terms of what we've talked about earlier, like the contact center, adding a leader to Europe, really focusing on marketing in the right way. And we haven't obviously given FY '25 guidance, but the goal is, and we've talked about before, starting to see reacceleration of growth as we exit FY '24 and having that continue into FY '25. And we're so early in the year of FY '24, but lining up everything to anticipate reacceleration as we exit the year. Across -- potentially... Yeah, I'm not going to get that specific, especially this early. We'll be prepared more great to talk about that later this year. Yes. Thank you, Karl. So as a quick reminder, our long-term target operating margin is lower, much lower than where we are operating today. And that is, as we've said in the past, to give us the opportunity as we see opportunities for investment to do so. We are really focused on doing everything we can to drive top line growth and continue to take market share. In the period of time where we've had slower growth, we've been focused on balancing that with profitability. But as we see opportunities, we absolutely could bring our margins down. So yes, I think we're at probably the peak of where our margins are. But again, we're always being very thoughtful about growth and profitability and balancing both of those. And then in terms of the Workvivo team, given they're amazing, and we're really excited about bringing them into the family, but they're having really, I would say, minimal impact on both the top line and the bottom line today. Yes. I think there's two things. I think first of all, we've seen online stabilize much more quickly than we anticipated or than we had been indicating to all of you. So I think the overall mix for the year is probably shaving up to be a little bit different than you anticipated and even a that we anticipated at the beginning of the year. And then we're doing -- as I said, we're doing everything we can to focus on supporting our direct sales organization. The distraction in was not de minimis, right? It was -- as I said, it was across not only the reduction but also a reorganization and some changes to incentives and comp plans. And so we're very happy that that's all behind us now, and we're all looking forward to do everything we can to support them and regain momentum there. Yeah. Bye everyone."

            "name": "Eric Yuan",
            "content": "Hey. Thank you, Tom. Thank you, everyone for joining us today. As we continue to execute on the strategic focuses, which I shared with you our last quarter, we are very grateful for the support, feedback and trust that we have received from our customers and investors. Last month, we closed our acquisition of Workvivo, which we are super excited about. Workvivo is a modern employee communication and engagement platform. Their solution combines a social intranet and employee app into one central hub, forming the heart of a company's digital ecosystem. Incorporating Workvivo's feature-rich technology into our all-in-one collaboration solution will allow us to offer Zoom customers, a unified platform that keeps knowledge workers and frontline employees informed, engaged, and connected throughout the workday, regardless of in-person, remote, or hybrid work style. According to Enterprise Apps Today, communicative employers have mobile workers who are 5 times more productive and feel 3 times less burned out. The Workvivo team is working very hard to capitalize on this opportunity and is 100% aligned with our culture of delivering happiness to customers and employees. We are so excited to join forces with Workvivo and help our customers raise the bar for employee communication and engagement. Last quarter, we reiterated our strong positioning in AI, and highlighted our expanded vision to see generative AI permeate and elevate productivity across our portfolio. In Q1, we made considerable progress towards that vision. We outlined our approach to AI is to drive forward solutions that are federated, empowering and responsible. Federated means flexible and customizable to businesses' unique scenarios and nomenclature. Empowering refers to building solutions that improve individual and team productivity as well as enhance the customer experience. And responsible means customer control of their data with an emphasis on privacy, security, trust and safety. At Enterprise Connect, we unveiled ZoomIQ's new set of in-beta features leveraging generative AI to support Chat and Email compose, and meeting summary. We are also building new features to summarize long chat threads, catch up tardy meeting participants on what they missed, and brainstorm in Whiteboard. Last week, we announced our strategic investment in Anthropic, an AI safety and research company working to build reliable, interpretable, and steerable AI systems. Our partnership with Anthropic further bolsters our federated approach to AI by allowing Anthropic's AI assistant, Claude, to be integrated across Zoom's entire platform. We plan to begin by layering Claude into our Contact Center portfolio, which includes Zoom Contact Center, Zoom Virtual Agent, and now in-beta Zoom Workforce Engagement Management. With Claude guiding agents toward trustworthy resolutions and powering self-service for end-users, companies will be able to take customer relationships to the next level. Now moving on to some of our customer wins. I would like to thank Major League Baseball. MLB has long used the power of the broader Zoom Platform to strengthen its connection to fans and teams. And this quarter, we expanded our relationship by launching a first-of-its-kind partnership that leverages Zoom Contact Center to enhance real-time replay reviews and deliver increased transparency to baseball fans. By introducing Zoom technologies into operations on and off the field, MLB strives to create an engaging and unique experience for its fans and teams. I would like to thank Virginia Tech for expanding our relationship by adding more than 10,000 Zoom Phone seats as well as Zoom Contact Center to their Zoom Meetings deployment. We brought responsiveness, reliability and regulatory compliance to this large expansion and Virginia Tech leverage Zoom's unified communications platform to build a next-gen solution integrated across meetings, phone and contact center, to serve the entire university community. I would also like to thank Vensure Employer Services, which has grown its workforce significantly the past few years through hiring and M&A. In Q1, Vensure expanded their existing footprint with us by adding approximately 10,000 Zoom Phone Seats and 800 Zoom Contact Center seats, as well as our AI-powered Zoom Virtual Agent and Zoom IQ for sales. It is so exciting to see customers leverage our natively integrated Phone plus Contact Center solutions and invest in our next generation AI-enabled products across their businesses. Finally, I want to thank My Plan Manager, Australia's leading services provider for the National Disability Insurance Program. MPM chose Zoom Contact Center for its attractive total cost of ownership, the deep integration with salesforce, and the vision and future roadmap for customer experience. And our journey did not end with Contact Center. Appreciating the value of the platform, they also decided to standardize on Zoom One. We are so happy to partner with MPM to help them deliver a world-class customer and employee experience to their clients and disability service providers. Again, thank you so much MLB, Virginia Tech, Vensure Services, MPM, and all of our customers worldwide. And with that, I'll pass it over to Kelly. Thank you. Yes. Good question. I think it looks like everyone seem to have just woken up to AI. Actually, we have been busy on AI front for a few years, if you look at the past several \u2013 two of the largest acquisitions, right, Solvvy and Kites, right, all of the AI-based. Internally, we also have AI team as well because we understand the importance of AI in particular during recently by the generative AI momentum. I think, first of all, we do have our own AI team. We have our own internally developed AI models as well. We also will take up a very open approach. Essentially, we announced our federated approach to AI. We announced the collaboration with the Open AI, Enterprise Connect. We also doubled on our partnership with Anthropic recently as well and down the road maybe some open source AI models available, we are also going to embrace that. Again, we look at everything from end user perspective, right? First of all, we have a team really dedicated on AI. And also, when we sit down with the customers, some customers say, yes, really like Anthropic model. Yes, why not. We doubled on that partnership, we know we can leverage their API as well, right? So we are taking a federated approach which is to put a customer centric, right? That's why we are very, very excited about this AI momentum can truly improve our product experience. Thank you. It's a good question. I would say the answer is about both. You take our Zoom IQ for sales, for example, right? It's extremely important, right? When you send all the salespeople back at the home or work remotely, how to help them to improve their productivity. That's the reason why we announced the Zoom IQ for sales and even way before the generative AI momentum, right? And internally developed large language models really help us, right? We can monetize that AI empowered Zoom IQ for sales product. At the same time, you look at our feature-rich collaboration portfolio, like a meeting summary, the e-mail and compose a chat message and Zoom Contact Center and Virtual Agent and also recently in beta, right, Workforce Management Solution as well, all of them will be empowered based on AI, the platform, right? So on the one hand, we leverage AI to look at almost every features we have to empower those features and also elevate the customer -- the product experience. At the same time, a lot of monetization opportunities, right? Zoom IQ for sales is just one example, right, as a real more opportunity for us. Again, we think AI does bring tremendous opportunity for us because we focus on communication, I think Workvivo, for example, right, we just acquired them in the employee communication and engagement [Indiscernible], how to leverage AI to improve that product experience that is another example. Again, full of opportunities here at Zoom with AI. Thank you. Yes. Good questions. We have a great integration with the Tesla cars, right? If you use drive a Tesla, just one click and join the call. Even if you can't come over the video, the audio will be always on anyway. So back to your AI question, I think, first of all, if you look at the generative AI, two things is very important, right? So first of all, if you do not start years back, just given what's going on in AI industry, AI world, you say, oh my god, a lot of things. However, we already started investing in AI, a few years back. We should understand that. The reason why our Zoom IQ for sales was developed based on our own internally developed large language models. Having said that, there are two things really important. One is just the model, right? Open AI has modeled Anthropic and Facebook as well, Google and those companies. But most important thing is, how to leverage these modules to fine-tune based on your proprietary data, right? That is extremely important. When it comes to collaboration, communication, right? Take a Zoom Employee, for example. We have so many meetings, right, and talk about every day, like our Sales team use the Zoom call with the customers. We accumulate a lot of, let's say, internal meeting data. How to fine tune the model with this data. It's very important, right? Not only just for the AI model itself because it will evolve for sure and also we're also going to embrace. At the same time, how to leverage our proprietary data to fine-tune these AI models towards our industry, that's very important. Look at -- take a meeting, for example, right? I think that this is probably we have way more data than anybody else, right, given all the past many years' experience, how to fine tune that model with those data. And I think this is our unique -- will help us to deliver unique experience to customers. If any other company, you may have, let's say, you have a greater AI model, however, how to fine-tune it. It's a lot of effort, right? That's the reason why we think that's something unique for us to truly empower AI to deliver a differentiated experience to our customers. Thank you. Appreciate it. I think on many fronts, right, like take Anthropic investing, for example, right? For sure, we are going to lever that not only for the entire portfolio, but we are going to start from a contact center, the virtual agent and the contracts and the related features. We also look at our core meeting platform, right, in meeting summary. It is extremely important, right? And it's also we have our team chat solution and also how to lever that to compose a chat. Remember, last year, we also have email candidate as well. How do we leverage the generative AI to understand the context, right, and kind of bring all the information relative to you and help you also generate the message, right? When you send an e-mail back to customers or prospects, right, either China message or e-mail, right? We can lever to generate is, right? I think a lot of areas, even like you like say, maybe you might be later to the meeting, right? 10 minutes later, you joined the meeting. You really want to stand in what had happened, right? Can you get a quick summary over the positive minutes. Yeah. You just also have to generate AI as well. You also can get that as well. It's kind of almost a lot of key use cases, right? I think will be empowered by those AI capabilities. That's why we are looking at almost every area, right, how to leverage generate to improve that experience. We take an Open AI, for example. This is a great company and also a lot of companies are leveraging their AI, not only bigger companies, small companies, we also announced the collaboration with them at Enterprise Connect, right? So that's why, as I said earlier, three things, right? You understand the large lung model, how to fine tune that with your own data and also revisit almost every feature you have -- are there any ways to empower those features? Are there any ways to monetize. That's why we take a holistic approach and also we like our federated approach to AI. By the way, internally, we do have AI team. It should understand the large language models. It's not something other companies just have work for AI. Thank you. That's a great question. By the way, I download the Open AI mobile iOS app, I should ask open ChatGPT to answer to another question. But anyway, you are so right on. When it comes vertical, I would say, the opportunity. There are two things. One is a departmental level, another one is a vertical industry, right? You look at our Zoom IQ for Sales specifically targeted sales use case or sales department, right? Contact Center is for supported part. You're so right, down the road HR department in marketing, almost every department, they all use Zoom, right? How to leverage AI to build a differentiated solution, right? That is the opportunity. That's one opportunity. Another opportunity really about the vertical industry. Take health care, for example. Zoom by far is number one on telemedicine, right? How to leverage that, right? And with those proprietary data, right, and also working together with the customers, right, and fine tune this AI model, right? This is one example. Another example is a lot of law firms are also using Zoom as well, right? And how to lever the AI to truly empower those use cases is also another opportunity. I think as I said earlier, AI truly brings tremendous opportunity to us. So we got to leverage that. The good news, we're already heavily invested in this area for a few years. Thank you. Good questions. Good news is a question not about AI anymore. So you're so right. I think that during the COVID, right, as a lot of consumer use cases, right? Almost every family, you have with company account like a Zoom account, right? After the COVID, I think if you look at the usage, right, consumer-centric usage, I think, less and less. But however, to support a hybrid work, enterprise customers, they are going to leverage the video content more and more, not only just to support remote work. When you try to support hybrid work, how to reserve a desk, all those basic features, right? How to make sure when you join the meeting from the comp room, right, remote people, they can't see you, right? Not only just big square, right? So everyone who are sitting in the comp room, equally, we have a square as well as Zoom Square, right? So those kind of experiences extremely important, right? A lot of features are built upon enabling hybrid work, right? Even Workvivo is not example, right? During the hybrid work, right? Quite often, you can chat, you use the e-mail or use the phone call, meetings. But sometimes also want to announce a very exciting news and record a video how to distribute those to employees and sometimes even to customers, that's the reason why we acquired Workvivo as well. I think hybrid work is going to stay. That's the reason why a lot of new use cases, right? How to double down on that. Take [Indiscernible], for example, we have the smart gallery view feature, right? Customers like that. However, in some cases, customers are still down to work. I have a huge conference room, how do you support that? That's the reason why we are working on supporting three cameras, right? That's another way to embrace hybrid work. I think the hybrid work does bring another kind of huge opportunity to us, especially it's hard to convince everyone back to office five days a week. Even for us, even if I talked with many CEOs. Everyone wanted, right, sometimes you want these employees more. But however, this is kind of to let employees work anywhere, it sort of become a fashion. It's hard to force employees back in the home. That's why you have to embrace hybrid work. That's the reason why Zoom can play a much bigger role to support the hybrid work. Thank you. Kelly, do you want to take it? By the way, just quickly to add on what the Kelly said, right? So as we add more and more new services also can help us more upsell opportunities even for online segment. take the Zoom Schedule, for example, we announced that new service, right? And some customers already paid for other services like [indiscernible] right? Customers, yeah, I'd like it to go with Zoom, deploy something similar, right? It's a part of the package, right? I think a lot of upsell opportunities for us to target the Online segment as well. Yes. Good question. So first of all, if you look at our collaboration platform, right? We really want to offer a unified communication and collaboration platform. Customers I can leave it in the room platform, right? I think today is one of the problems we are facing customer also mention for us as well, right? Quite often, we send all kind of message either to e-mail, it's really hard to find, not scalable or you send message to chat, bar all those public channels, right? Customers also wanted to essentially like see a video message, right? I want to share to the entire employee base and a maybe a department of news, right? All those kind of accounting, right? Are there any other better ways to share and engage these employee, right? I think that's the reason why we think Workvivo can play a bigger role right to put on those kind of use cases, right? It's not only for the short term, is a key missing element of our entire product portfolio, but also in the long run, also is will help us a lot because of the AI, right, because how do you make sure you have more data, right, and really collaborating communication-related data, right? It's Workvivo for sure. Every day we use engaged with our employees, we are -- what we platform, you will generate lots of data, right? All those are very, I would say, is relevant and meaningful, right? How to lever the AI, right? That's why in the long run, certainly it can help us more. Thank you. So Kelly, I'll address the first one, you take the second one. I think in terms of how to monetize generative AI. I think first of all, take Zoom IQ for Sales for example, that's a new service to target for the sales deportment. That AI technology is based on generative AI, right, so we can monetize. And also seeing some features, even before the general AI popularity, we have a live transmission feature, right? And also, that's not a free feature. It is a paid feature, right, behind the paywall, right? And also a lot of good features, right, take the Zoom meeting summary, for example, for enterprise -- and the customers, if you deploy Zoom One, deploys why do we have those features, right? For to customers, see three, all those SMB customers, they did not deploy Zoom One. They may not get to those features, right? That's the reason -- another reason for us to monetize. I think there's multiple ways to monetize, yes. Thank you. Sure. Yeah. I think Anthropic is a great partner, and this is a great team. And when we look at the AI landscape, I think why not double down on that partnership, right? And given our federal AI approach, right, internally we discussed that happened to be in the middle of using another round of financing, right? That's why how to solidify our partnership, right? Again, they are a great team, greater technology. And I think this is no brainer for us, we invest in them to further solidify the partnership. And yeah, so that's pretty much because look at our contact center, right, we will further empower our contact center offering, right, and also download applied to an entire product portfolio. Again, this is very important to our federated approach to AI, and that's the reason why you invested in them. Well, thank you all for your time. Really appreciate all your support, and thank you, as you all in our next meeting. I appreciate it. Cheers."
