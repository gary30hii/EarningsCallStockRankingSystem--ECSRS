And welcome to The Hershey Company, Fourth Quarter 2020 Question-and-Answer Session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host. Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin.\nMelissa Poole: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2020 Earnings Q&A Session.

With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. \nNik Modi: Yes, hi. Good morning everyone. Happy New Year. The \u2013 a couple of questions. First on just trade spend and just thinking about, obviously things have been pulled back quite dramatically in 2020 and as we think about 2021, I'm just curious in terms of your discussions with retailors, how your talking about trade spending.  One of the things that we've been looking at is kind of this reset of price sensitivity given that no promotion, so the effect would have been in the market for the past nine to 10 months. So just wanted to get your thoughts on that? And then the other question is just, if you can give us a kind of a round-up of the innovation program that has already been announced, just so we can get a sense for the program in 2021? Thanks. \nMichele Buck: Sure. So relative to trade spending and promotion, we didn't have any meaningful shifts in promotion activity. Our levels for the year were pretty consistent with the prior year. So we were basically flat. The IRI data will support that, so I think there is a little bit of a disconnect in the Nielsen data. So we don't really expect any material changes as we go into next year as well.  And then as you look at innovation, certainly I think some of the bigger items we have, Kit Kat flavors which has done exceptionally well for Kit Kat on a global basis. We have the Stuffed Reese\u2019s product and our Reese Innovation tends to also always be quite strong for us.  We have a permissible line of products to really address that benefit of better-for-you that we are under developed in across our portfolio, and that will include Kit Kat Thins, which is an addition to what has been an already launch of a successful platform with Reese Thins. We are also relaunching our sugar free line to Zero-Sugar, really focusing on Hershey and Reese and launching Hershey and Reese organic products. So those are the highlights of the year, and I would say overall if you looked at our innovation, the level of innovation is about comparable to prior year. \nNik Modi: Excellent! Thanks Michele. I\u2019ll pass it on. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question. \nKen Goldman: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Two from me if I can. First, I wanted to think or ask about you know the early holiday shipments that benefited for Q. Obviously, I think over the 4Q, 1Q \u201821 period it's overall a big benefit to you. So I don't think of it as early shipments, but I am curious, how do we look at the potential for a difficult comparison in 4Q \u201821 or should we expect maybe some of these additional orders that you receive this to kind of revert to normal with your competitors or you know maybe better able to fill demand going forward. \nMichele Buck : So Ken, if you think about the Easter that we\u2019ll be shipping for in Q4, that 2022 Easter, happens to be one of those incredibly long Easters, and so typically we tend to ship a bit more in the Q4 prior to a long Easter. So we don't expect that there's going to be a material difference from a year-to-year basis because of that. \nKen Goldman: Thank you, and then just for my follow-up, you know your commentary on cocoa butter costs was I think more constructive than some observes maybe expected, which is great. But I'm hoping you can expand on that a bit, and maybe this is for Steve, just how do we think about you're all in cogs inflation this year versus 2020? \nSteve Voskuil : Sure, yes I'm happy to take that one. We are clearly facing, on an all-in basis facing more inflation this year than last year. As you know we\u2019ve got the hedging program which mutes some of the cocoa impact as the LID flows through, and we have some longer term contracts on things like freight and warehousing.  But that said, neither hedging or contracting is going to fully cover the exposure that we have in inflation and I think, if I take freight as an example, you know we look at things like demand planning and how important that is, and to the extent our plans deviate from the way volume comes in and have them go to the spot market for example where we have less cover, there is some risk there.  So net-net more inflation, you know we've got a pretty good level of cover and that's included inside of our guidance, but we're not fully covered either on the commodity side or outside the commodities. \nKen Goldman: Great, thanks so much. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions. \nAndrew Lazar: Good morning everybody. \nMichele Buck: Hi Andrew. \nAndrew Lazar: Hi! I guess first off it seems as though Hershey\u2019s building in a fair amount of reinvestment spend for \u201821 in both media and other capabilities. Maybe can you give us a sense of the magnitude of this sort of reinvestment and maybe more importantly the ability to be sort of flex up or down really depending on how things play out this year. \nMichele Buck: Steve, do you want to talk about that? \nSteve Voskuil : Happy to take that one as well, yes. So on the on the media side, I\u2019ll say media and SG&A in general, we\u2019re probably looking at something like mid-single digits across those pieces. On the media side, clearly we want to you know defend and extend our share gains and so you know we were thoughtful in how we deployed media last year. We made some reductions kind of mid-year. We actually turned it up a little bit towards the end of the year and we want to make sure as we go in to this year that we've got enough to defend and extend share. On the SG&A side, you know we kind of think about it in two buckets, and I'll say things like you know normal corporate expense, travel will be very tight year-over-year and there \u2013 you know these year based budgeting formats, watch headcount, all of that.  And then we talk about the investment side. In the investment side we do have some capabilities that we want to continue to fortify, you know S/4 in the ERP program drives some OpEx through the SG&A areas. More expansion of our digital capabilities which came into play quite a bit over the course of last year and anything analytics and insights, but again we talked a lot about them last year as well, but continuing to extend our capabilities in those spaces.  And so you know could it slide us up or down? I think as we get into the year and we see how you know the shape of the P&L and we see how the top line delivers, you know we probably have some latitude and flexibility there, but I would say we have pretty firm investment plans at least in those areas as we start the year. \nAndrew Lazar: Great! And then just lastly, I'm curious what drove the decision to take a better pricing on sort of one portion of the seasonal business, and should we also assume, I would think that this does not necessarily preclude Hershey from looking at other parts of the seasonal portfolio at some point if in fact you know it deems necessary to do so down the line. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what goes into that sort of decision making process? Thank you. \nA - Michele Buck: So if we step back and think about the seasonal pricing holistically, let me just remind you that we had priced the Halloween portion of the season and Halloween is our biggest season, so that had occurred previously, and that's about, you know roughly call it 10% of our season. And then we mentioned that with the pricing in Holiday, Valentine and Easter, you know we're capturing at least another 10 points. There are certain parts of the season, some of the everyday items that got priced along with prior, instant consumable pricing actions. So at this point in time with this recent pricing action we really have priced almost all of the season in the past year so here. \nAndrew Lazar: Great! Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi! Thanks for the question and congrats on a really strong year. You provided some helpful color on your cocoa buying and cocoa liquor and butter, but it sounds like these hedges are protecting you this year. Is there an extensive step up in 2022 and it is possible that more pricing will be needed when the full effect of the LID comes into play, not just for you, but maybe for the overall industry. \nMichele Buck: Steve, do you want to talk about that?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah, I\u2019d be happy to. So I don\u2019t want to get too far ahead and get into 2022. Obviously as we said in the past, our range of hedging could to be anywhere from three months to 24 months and so and that flexes across commodities and so \u2013 but I don't want to get too specific in \u201922. But as we know, hedging helps smooth the impacts over time.  At the end of the day as the LID flows through and sticks, then eventually that\u2019s going to come into play in the cost, and so hedging can smooth that out, but to the extent the cocoa price picks that up, eventually that comes through. Now then that ties into the broader strategy Michele just talked about in pricing and looking at the overall P&L and other things like cocoa sourcing and recipes and things of that nature. \nA - Michele Buck: And Rob, let me just clarify one thing. So the LID is fully in play this year, so the hedges don't really impact that at all. Part of what's offsetting that as the hedge is we had even possibly prior to the LID going in or taking advantage of you know dislocations and supply and demand throughout the course of 2020. There were times when you know the cocoa market had come down for beans and things like that, so that's really there.  Just to be fully clear, the LID is 100% in the cost base for 2021, but you have some of those hedges with supply and demand imbalances, as well as that cocoa butter dynamic, which is really where the offset is. And so as you think about \u201922, those will be the two variables to kind of keep an eye on, of what could causes those costs to change, more so than the LID.\nSteve Voskuil: That's right. \nRobert Moskow: Okay, I'll follow-up on that. Maybe one follow-up. Can you give us a sense of where you think inventory levels are right now at the trade? Are you still a little bit below normal inventory or are you at normal and may be a little more color on \u2013 I think in the prepared remarks you say you might ship above consumption in the first half and below consumption in the second half. Steve, can you help us with a little bit more on that?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah, that's exactly right. You know we ended the year with inventories in the trade of little below historical averages, so as we look to the next year, you know we see that could be a bit of a tailwind in the first half and a headwind perhaps in the back half at the year. \nRobert Moskow: Okay, alright. Well, thank you. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question. \nAlexia Howard : Good morning, everyone. \nA - Michele Buck: Hello!\nAlexia Howard : Hi there! So it seems as though the top line particularly change was better than expected versus the guidance that you gave last quarter. I'm just wondering you know what was favorable versus where you were three months ago in terms of how the results came through in the fourth quarter and then I have a follow-up. \nA - Michele Buck: Sure. So Alexia, the most significant portion of our over delivery in Q4 was seasons. It was probably about two-thirds of our over delivery, and I would call it somewhat one time in nature if you think about it, so there were two parts to that.  One was we did have retailers requesting early shipments, so that they could make sure that they had adequate supply as they came into 2021, so those shipments were incremental. And then we also had exceptionally strong sell through, both for Halloween and for Holiday, and that has kind of a knock on effect where we then have less discounting required you know post the holiday and less cannibalization of the everyday business, so you kind of get back to the everyday business even more quickly.  So those investments and the focus that we put, both in terms of media and in store merchandising to drive category growth during the season really paid off for us, but that was the, you know kind of the single biggest factor that was different than we had anticipated. \nAlexia Howard : Right, and then as my follow-up, I just wanted a little bit more color on China. You talked about the change in the go-to-market model there. I think you're talking about using local produces to get the product out. Is that instead of going through the retailers or is that something \u2013 I just wanted to understand a little bit better exactly what the changes are over there and also how big is China today as a percentage of overall sales. Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on.\nMichele Buck: So really the shift is relying less on a large owned retail sales force and instead really focusing more on you know a master distributor type of arrangement, which is just more efficient and more effective. Clearly we will give up some level of sales. There will be some slippage in taking that approach, but we think it is the most efficient and effective way for us to get our product to consumers.  And then relative to the size of China, Steve do you want to hit that?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah, today it's about 60 base \u2013 you know 0.6% of company sales and so I think in the past if we go back to early \u201920, your right, we said it was about 1% of sales, and if you think about between then and now you got two things; obviously COVID had a pretty big impact on that business for us in the first half, and again strictly because we were concentrated in the gifting space, which was hit early last year and then the second piece is part of moving to the new model and some of those transition changes. \nAlexia Howard : Great! Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Good morning, thank you. Just curious to get a little better sense of some of the sustainability of your share gains and just would love to understand how much you feel like it's innovation driven, execution driven, is it the higher marketing spending? It\u2019s some amount, probably all of those, but is it \u2013 you know how much of the marketing efficiencies you saw last year? Are you still seeing and is that an important piece of what's driving some of the share momentum in \u201921? How should we just think about all that together?\nA - Michele Buck: Sure. So I think our share gains really are as you mentioned, a factor of many different components coming together. First of all, we do have incredibly strong brand and very strong operating capabilities and executional capabilities. I think as I look at the year, you know we got a broad portfolio and we are able then to leverage that portfolio and pivot as needed to whatever occasion are resonating most with consumers and families right now.  So certainly this past year there were a lot of those at home occasions. Things like S'mores where people were staying, being with their family at home in a smaller environment, doing movie night. You know products like Twizzlers. And seasons were it turned out to be incredibly important for consumers during this very difficult time where they wanted to cling to as much normalcy as possible and the seasons are really about traditions and rituals and connections with family and close friends. You know as you mentioned, we also made strong investments over the past several years and a lot of capabilities that allowed us to understand consumers, improved our ability to forecast where consumers were going to go, and then really execute well in our supply chain, apply data and analytics to our sales and retail coverage, data and analytics to our media in ways that we believe some others can't.  You know early on we had discussed with all of you that we made that decision to lean in and capture opportunity as much as possible during COVID, take the opportunity and create new occasions for consumers and really partner with our retailers to make sure we were there for them when they need us with our retail sales folks in store stocking shelves and meeting their product needs when some others couldn't, so clearly all of those things together were really important for us. Now, as we look at that I would say, you know we are \u2013 you know in the past typically might have been 10, 20 basis points of share in a year. Obviously this year 160 basis points of share and you know 130 on our chocolate business where we already have a 45% market share. So as we look into 2021, we believe that the share growth will continue prior to the last, which is really you know basically up to Easter, and post Easter we believe that the share will moderate as we lap those 20 gains, but it's going to be our goal to profitably sustain as much of the share as we can going forward. \nMichael Lavery: Okay, thank you, that's helpful color. And just a follow-up on your portfolio shaping. You mentioned in the prepared remarks you know interest in better-for-you. Obviously some of how you're doing that is spins and portion sizes that are organic type driven. But as far as M&A how should we think about maybe in broad strokes what to expect from any bigger push into better for you there. \nA - Michele Buck: Yeah, if you look at our M&A strategy, clearly it is focused on us capturing incremental snacking occasions and some of the ways that we look at that is you know clearly we do have a pretty sizeable business in sweet indulgent type products and as we look at consumers broad snacking needs, clearly you know salty savory and better-for-you are opportunities where our portfolio is under developed. And if you look at our past history of acquisition you would see that many of our acquisitions have been focused in that space. You know Skinny Pop is a great example of that. So clearly that is a focus area for us within our M&A strategy. \nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thank you very much. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions. \nDavid Palmer : Thanks and congratulations on the year. Could you comment specifically on how much you think of your share gains this year or this last year 2020 was because of the supply chain advantages you might have had versus the competition. If it were supply chain or at least mostly supply chain, you would have expected diminishing share gains through the year, but the opposite seemed to have been the case, and I have a quick follow-up. \nA - Michele Buck: Yeah, I mean it is difficult in a year like this past year to precisely pinpoint exact amounts to any one factor, just because there was so much going on. I mean clearly we know supply chain was a piece of it. You know frankly though we also believe how we pivoted our portfolio and really shifted spending and shifted focus on our portfolio to the exact right items that consumers were looking for, you know the role that we were able to focus on with season and how much that resonated with consumers during that time.  So it's difficult to pinpoint \u2013 you know there were opportunities for products on shelves, and so I guess I would say you know I think it's fair to say some of that was probably short term benefits and then there are other components that have somewhat of a longer lasting effect. So for example, if you do well in a season one year and your sell-through was quite strong, typically the buy that you get from retailers the next year tends to be pretty strong as well.  You know if you're able to gain shelf space and get incremental items on shelves, typically if they're performing well, you have the opportunity to keep them on a sustained basis. So, well some of the benefits I think are short term, others will have that enduring effect. \nDavid Palmer : Yeah, thank you and just a follow-up on some of the comments you made about the advertising spending, as a percentage of sales going up to 21, clearly there's been a lot of changes out there in terms of the depths of digital marketing in the perhaps more exact return on investment you can get or calculate from those. I'm wondering at this point, after many years of declining, not just for Hershey but for the industry, ad spend has come down as efficiency was more the focus. Do you think that you can get to a point where you can get a flywheel going, where you spend as much or maybe even lean in on advertising as a percentage of sales as you get a better sense of the returns on these types of spending? Thanks. \nMichele Buck: Yeah, I mean our approach on media spend is, you know this is a category and we have brands that are incredibly responsive to media, and if you look at ROIs on media being driven by scale, profit margin and lift, last responsiveness, we win on all three of those. So we are one of the highest spenders on advertising as a percent of net sales within the industry and we really believe in that.  At the same time we challenge ourselves constantly to get more from our money, and so over the years we have transitioned from 100% television advertising, probably 12 years ago to we are now down to probably 40%. I think about 60%, 65% of our spending is digital. Now the other factor that kind of plays in, in addition to being more efficient through digital which enabled us to do a lot of very targeted things such as targeting media, based on how sell-through is during a season or targeting zip codes, etcetera, you have the other factor going on, which is you know media, the cost of media in the marketplace and inflation and kind of playing through that.  If you think about 2020, our spending was down a little bit because we pulled back on some parts of the portfolio that we thought you know just weren\u2019t relevant like refreshment this year, so part of our increase is restoring some spend levels in some of those areas, and that's part of what's driving up some of our spending as well. \nDavid Palmer : Got it, thank you very much. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your questions. \nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning, thanks for the question. Yes, I guess first off Michele, I wanted to go back to the Zero Sugar product. Can you share a bit in terms of you know what's enabling that relaunch? Is there anything there recipe wise that's different and then where do you expect it to price relative to the baseline portfolio and is it fair to think that it's, I guess at least gross margin neutral relative to the base. \nMichele Buck: Yes, so a lot of the proposition is kind of relaunch, rebranding to \u2013 you know think about this as a product that we launched many, many years ago, more as sugar free for diabetics, which is what, you know what that was about, I don't know, call it 20 years ago probably. And really the bulk of the relaunch is about repositioning sugar free in a way that is more contemporary. You know you look at beverages and Zero Sugar and you know lots of other categories, I mean those products are just positioned entirely differently in a much more contemporary way and that's really our goal. We actually think that the products are pretty good tasting too and we're getting good response from consumers, but it is a lot about the repositioning of them. And I'm sorry what was the latter part of your question? \nJohn Baumgartner: In terms of the profit contribution, is it sort of neutral from a gross margin perspective relative to the base? \nSteve Voskuil: Yeah, it\u2019s in the same zip code, and the repositioning isn't going to be a you know a whole new P&L there. \nJohn Baumgartner: Okay, great. And then just you know a follow-up in terms of retail assortments. I think part of the strategy has been smarter execution that allows for some muscling out of shelf space, the front end from lower velocity and lower profit categories for retailers. But I think since COVID you\u2019ve seen some pretty sharp declines and distribution points for mints and gum. Has anything changed in that environment, whether it's an uptick in hand sanitizers or anything else, that maybe forces you to pivot in terms of how you're thinking about shelf gains to the front end in a COVID world. Thank you. \nMichele Buck: No, I mean I would say you know mint and gum, clearly there was pressure on mints and gums relative to COVID as a segment. But part of what you might be seeing is how frequently something scans and versus high frequency which can some impact \u2013 sometimes impact what distribution actually looks like, but sometimes it's there and not scanning. So we haven't had any kind of material changes in our brand and portfolio broadly. We feel pretty good about our portfolio, largely focused on ice breakers as a key brand, which has strong points of competitive differentiation in the product and does well in the brand. So we are \u2013 yeah, we are feeling pretty good about where we are in distributions, overall for us and our brands. \nJohn Baumgartner: Okay, thanks Michele. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. \nChris Growe: Hi, good morning. Just had two follow-on questions for you if I could. Just curious, Ken asked earlier about the incremental shipments that occurred in the fourth quarter. Is it as simple as looking at your consumption and comparing it to what you reported to understand like how much that seasonal shipment pattern changed or were there other factors, the inventory replenishment, that kind of thing and like you mentioned some non-measured channels that may have affected your shipments in the fourth quarter. \nMichele Buck: Yeah, non-measured was the other piece. Seasons was the \u2013 you know was the biggest component. Non-measured channel which we believe was driven by inventory replenishment. There was also the minor area of there were more shopping days in Q4 versus the prior year and so that contributed as well. \nChris Growe: Okay. Thank you. Then just another follow-on was in relation to the international division. Do you expect international sales growth this year? You talk about achieving market stability in 2021, and I guess I'm curious also on that question excluding China, so to understand kind of how the other markets are faring given the uniqueness of China. \nMichele Buck: So yes, we do expect modest international sales growth which ex-China would be even higher, as we discussed will be living through some changes, the impact of some of the changes in the model, but we do expect modest growth internationally. Each market is a little bit different. You know we continue to feel good on long term basis about international. It\u2019s an important part of our business, it drives incremental, incremental source of growth for us and then as I said, each market\u2019s a bit different.  India we saw some nice rebound and a strong finish to the year. Well certainly earlier in the year India suffered through a lot of COVID related pressure. In Brazil constant currency sales were good. They were double digit, but FX has been a challenge. Mexico really is the market\u2019s that contended or has tended to have continued COVID pressure, where the category sales have remained soft, even though they are improving and a lot of that is driven by two factors, you know store declines, traditional trade, store closures and less of those family celebrations where chocolate has traditionally played such an important role.  So it's a little bit of a tale with multiple cities as we look at each piece around the world, but in totality will lead to modest growth. \nChris Growe: Okay, thanks for all the color. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. \nJason English: Hey, good morning folks. Thank you for spotting me in and congrats on a strong finish to the year.  A couple of quick follow-on questions, you mostly already covered a lot of ground. First, in response to one question and I forget who asked it in terms of glide path for market share. You mentioned strength up to the period where we entered COVID and then a fade from there. Just for clarification, are you talking about a fade in gain or do you expect your market share to flip into net losses as you give back some of the outsides gains from this past year. \nMichele Buck: Yes, so I would say our goal \u2013 we expect we will continue to gain share through the lap and then once the lap hits, we are going to be focused relentlessly on trying to profitably sustain as much of the share gain that we can.  Obviously it's hard to predict what will happen, what will be going on in the market place competitively, etcetera. Category mix alone could pressure our share a little bit, as gum will likely rebound versus \u201820 and we are under developing gum, so that mix shift alone puts a little bit of pressure, and I guess that's probably the only specific thing I\u2019d call out.  We will be executing and it\u2019s one of the reasons that Steve mentioned earlier, that we are really making sure we have significant investments this year, so that we invest in trying to maintain those share gains. \nJason English: That's helpful thanks. And one more related follow-on. I think in response to Mr. Modi\u2019s question, you mentioned that you held your trades; it\u2019s been flat for the year. It\u2019s our understanding that some of your competitors did not do the same. That they actually pulled back on some trade and pulled back on some merchandising activity suggesting that you likely gained share of trade spend, share of merchandising, share of activity in the marketplace. (A) is that understanding well placed to misplaced, and if it is sort of the reality of what happened last year, any indication that some of those folks who called back maybe leaning back in? \nMichele Buck: Yes, so it is a fair statement that some \u2013 we won some competitive merchandising, absolutely, as we had good product to deliver to really deliver for retailers and for consumers. But we really want share in every aspect of the business, you know velocity, promotion, shelf space, season, so pretty much across the board our share gains were pretty pervasive. \nJason English: Yeah, well done. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on. \nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning everyone. I guess just two quick ones on capital allocation. First, share repurchases. I think in the prepared remarks you talked about \u201821 kind of being a more normal year. So are share repurchases or reducing the share count part of the build to the earnings growth for \u201821 or the mid asset. So are we, do share purchases create any of the earnings leverage?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, they do. Again more going back to historic levels, you know recent history. Last year was usual on capital allocation, the number of fronts is being cautious on share repurchase among other areas. As we look to \u201821 and plan this year, we're expecting share repurchase to revert to a more normal level. And again our goal is not to warehouse cash at the end of the day. We want to deploy it for profitable growth and share purchase becomes one levering creating some good constructive tension in that equation. \nBryan Spillane: We\u2019ll warehouse some cash for you in our living room if you'd like. The other just capital spending, I think we're going to be at $550 million for this year and maybe can you remind us, I know it's been elevated because you've been investing in some capabilities and some manufacturing capacity. Just kind of where we are in this CapEx cycle and is $550 million kind of a good number to run out going forward or are we still, is that still kind of reflective of a more elevated capital spending. \nSteve Voskuil: Yes it's more elevated, the answer is somewhere in between. If you remember last year we started targeting $450 million to $500 million for CapEx. Again, one of the areas we were a little bit cautious on was projects last year and with COVID and pressure on resources we had to reprioritize some things last year and the net effect of that was a little bit less CapEx in \u201920 and that CapEx pushing into \u201921, and for the main project there to the biggest ERP being one and work on supply chain. The total project cost didn't change and so it shifted more into \u201821 and therefore you can imagine some shifted into \u201822 as well. And so, but this year it's usually high. I think we're going to see elevated CapEx sort of above our long term algorithm, probably \u201923 ,\u201924 and we're going to talk a little bit more about that and tag me in a few weeks, we\u2019ll give some more color on capital and where it\u2019s headed, but I would expect an elevated level for the next couple of years before we get back down to what's inside of our algorithm. \nBryan Spillane: Okay, and then just last one tied into capital allocation, maybe a bit of a follow-on to question I was asked earlier about M&A. With interest rates being so low, you know it sort of you know changes the deal dynamics a little bit, right. We\u2019ve seen a couple of acquisitions either rumored or on the tape in the last few months that are very accretive, because we are borrowing it at under 2%, in some cases it\u2019s under 1%. So with that kind of backdrop, does that at all impact maybe the appetite of both in terms of just doing deals, but also size. You know we've got this unusual opportunity, there is plenty of liquidity, you know does that at all kind of change maybe the way you're thinking about M&A today verses you know might have been a year or two ago in a different environment. \nSteve Voskuil: Sure, I'll start and Michele can add on. I think from an appetite stand point we have the appetite and the second piece, we have great balance sheet. And so we generate a lot of cash, we've got flexibility, we like where we're at and so we are poised for the environment that we're in. I think Michele did a great job earlier kind of pointing to where those hunting grounds are you know we're aware of the external environment and where interest rates are and what may or may not be hitting the market, and we want to be able to participate in that growth just like everybody else.  Anything to add to that Michele? \nMichele Buck: No, nothing. Well said. \nBryan Spillane: Alright, great. Thanks everyone. \nOperator: The next question is coming from the lines of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your questions. \nKen Zaslow: Hey, good morning everyone. \nMichele Buck: Good morning. \nSteve Voskuil: Morning. \nKen Zaslow: Hello!\nMichele Buck: Yeah, good morning. \nKen Zaslow: Can you talk about your pipeline for Packaging Innovation? How that should impact pricing, not just in 2021 but also 2022, and how deep it is and you're just a thought process on you know packaging innovation and the pricing that's assigned to that. \nMichele Buck: Yes, so when we think about packaging innovation, you know we think about pack types which are designed to meet specific consumer occasions. So this is \u2013 for me I would encompass this as part of kind of price backed architecture, which is as we look to capture incremental consumer occasions how do we have certain packs that enable that, so that there\u2019s a value to the consumer that you know our products now better meet an occasion or a need.  If you go back and look at, you know we went from lay down to stand-up bags, not only was it easier to shop on shelves, but it was also, once it got into the home, in the pantry, much easier to use, much easier to see, less messy, those types of things. We will look at pack configurations in terms of you know size, like is there a smaller size than it used for certain occasions or certain demographics versus a larger pack and we'll do that on a brand-by-brand basis.  So I would say that our pipeline is largely kind of focused on what we would say price pack architecture and so as such, what we trying and do from a strategic perspective is make sure that we are at least margin neutral. I mean that would be our goal. We can get price realization, obviously that\u2019s the focus, but short of that we want to be margin neutral. \nKen Zaslow: Okay. I appreciate it, thank you very much. \nOperator: The next question is from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions. \nRob Dickerson: Great, thanks so much. Just, sorry you had some good question answered there. You know I guess in the prepared remarks you had mentioned the bar business, I guess the named ONE is the brand. You had stated that it seems like some, maybe retailer shifted space to protein drinks and powders right, through just to meet the COVID demand shift. But then also saying, kind of given the discussions with retailers, the expectation is that, kind of that bar business would come back.  So just asking, kind of broadly speaking, as you look at that bar category, relative to protein shake powders, are those conversations with retailers like fairly pointed, such that either they are suggesting, oh this is what we're doing for this period of time, but as we get through lets says Q2 or what have you, you know we would look to reallocate back to certain brands and certain bars, or is this kind of more of a you know \u201cyes, it\u2019s going to probably come back, let's kind of wait and see how everything develops\u201d and that's kind of a big question I guess for bars, but then also more holistically for the entire store. \nMichele Buck: Yes, I mean since retailors are \u2013 yes they are always looking to try and optimize their space according to what the current consumer demand is, and so you know \u2013 hey, nobody knows how long, what the curve of the pandemic is going to look like. So I can't tell you a specific time when it will shift and obviously it will shift at different times with different retailers too, based on who their consumers are.  So I would say it\u2019s less \u2013 we have a definitive timeline and you know we are focused on one, on how we make sure that we got the right score behind the brand and the right innovation relative to mini\u2019s which we think is a big idea and also plant based which are on trend, so that as the category does come back, we are well positioned to capture that. \nRob Dickerson: Okay, fair enough. And then you know look, I\u2019m totally impressed with kind of all the different areas that you're focused on in \u201821 right and kind of on the go forward, right where we were talking about a little bit more sugar free potentially, right, obviously there's ESG going, you got some plant based innovation maybe more on the bar side, you mentioned before touching potentially increasingly into baked snacks.  So I guess Michele you know the question is, as you step back right, it seems like Hershey continued to evolve right, in more of a broader snacking business, obviously outside of the core chocolate confection. So as we get through \u201821 and we think about \u201922, like very simplistically you know would you argue that you know the point here is to kind of get Hershey bigger in the store, in a bunch of different areas such that you are increasing overall distribution points on the go-forward for broader Hershey? Or do you feel like as you step back as a whole company, yes obviously you're looking for a quick distribution, but maybe there's a little bit of in-sell on a skew maybe on Sugar Free and maybe you take one out in Kisses. So I'm just trying to right size kind of that increased distribution opportunity given all the different spaces that you're focused on. Thanks, that\u2019s it. \nMichele Buck: Yes, so I guess I would say first and foremost you know our number one priority is always our core confection business, because it is the mother ship, it is our profit engine, we have tremendous strength, it's growing within consumer demand and so you know we always start there.  And then with that as the foundation we really looked across all the capabilities that we have as a company relative to consumer insight, to taste science, to ubiquitous distribution, all of that and say how could we leverage that to capture more and more incremental consumer occasion and so I think that\u2019s where you know you see us with a targeted focus on, okay something like better-for-you should capture an incremental occasion, an incremental consumer. so I would think about that as kind of more incremental. And then if I look at you know flavor variety on the core, to me that\u2019s a little bit more where we rotate in, we rotate out, you know we have one slot for that, but it\u2019s not a permeate incremental. Some of our expansion into other categories, i.e., better-for-you in savory, yeah I look at those as gaining incremental distribution points more broadly in the store by meeting incremental consumer occasion.  So I think incremental occasion is importation for us, leveraging the capabilities, and then importantly making sure that we do a very measured expansion. We want to focus on confection, add-in area and really play to win there, and make sure we don\u2019t spread ourselves too thin, similarly to what I would say we\u2019d do on international. We have a focused select set of markets that we prioritize, that we really want to play to win as oppose to spreading ourselves too thin.\nRob Dickerson: Alright, great. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Thank you. At this time I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Melissa Poole for closing remarks. \nMelissa Poole: Thank you so much for joining us this morning. I will be available throughout the day to answer any follow-up questions you may have. \nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

First on just trade spend and just thinking about, obviously things have been pulled back quite dramatically in 2020 and as we think about 2021, I'm just curious in terms of your discussions with retailors, how your talking about trade spending.  One of the things that we've been looking at is kind of this reset of price sensitivity given that no promotion, so the effect would have been in the market for the past nine to 10 months. So just wanted to get your thoughts on that? And then the other question is just, if you can give us a kind of a round-up of the innovation program that has already been announced, just so we can get a sense for the program in 2021? Thanks. Excellent! Thanks Michele. I'll pass it on."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "A - Michele Buck",
            "content": "So if we step back and think about the seasonal pricing holistically, let me just remind you that we had priced the Halloween portion of the season and Halloween is our biggest season, so that had occurred previously, and that's about, you know roughly call it 10% of our season. And then we mentioned that with the pricing in Holiday, Valentine and Easter, you know we're capturing at least another 10 points. There are certain parts of the season, some of the everyday items that got priced along with prior, instant consumable pricing actions. So at this point in time with this recent pricing action we really have priced almost all of the season in the past year so here. And Rob, let me just clarify one thing. So the LID is fully in play this year, so the hedges don't really impact that at all. Part of what's offsetting that as the hedge is we had even possibly prior to the LID going in or taking advantage of you know dislocations and supply and demand throughout the course of 2020. There were times when you know the cocoa market had come down for beans and things like that, so that's really there.  Just to be fully clear, the LID is 100% in the cost base for 2021, but you have some of those hedges with supply and demand imbalances, as well as that cocoa butter dynamic, which is really where the offset is. And so as you think about '22, those will be the two variables to kind of keep an eye on, of what could causes those costs to change, more so than the LID. Hello! Sure. So Alexia, the most significant portion of our over delivery in Q4 was seasons. It was probably about two-thirds of our over delivery, and I would call it somewhat one time in nature if you think about it, so there were two parts to that.  One was we did have retailers requesting early shipments, so that they could make sure that they had adequate supply as they came into 2021, so those shipments were incremental. And then we also had exceptionally strong sell through, both for Halloween and for Holiday, and that has kind of a knock on effect where we then have less discounting required you know post the holiday and less cannibalization of the everyday business, so you kind of get back to the everyday business even more quickly.  So those investments and the focus that we put, both in terms of media and in store merchandising to drive category growth during the season really paid off for us, but that was the, you know kind of the single biggest factor that was different than we had anticipated. Sure. So I think our share gains really are as you mentioned, a factor of many different components coming together. First of all, we do have incredibly strong brand and very strong operating capabilities and executional capabilities. I think as I look at the year, you know we got a broad portfolio and we are able then to leverage that portfolio and pivot as needed to whatever occasion are resonating most with consumers and families right now.  So certainly this past year there were a lot of those at home occasions. Things like S'mores where people were staying, being with their family at home in a smaller environment, doing movie night. You know products like Twizzlers. And seasons were it turned out to be incredibly important for consumers during this very difficult time where they wanted to cling to as much normalcy as possible and the seasons are really about traditions and rituals and connections with family and close friends. You know as you mentioned, we also made strong investments over the past several years and a lot of capabilities that allowed us to understand consumers, improved our ability to forecast where consumers were going to go, and then really execute well in our supply chain, apply data and analytics to our sales and retail coverage, data and analytics to our media in ways that we believe some others can't.  You know early on we had discussed with all of you that we made that decision to lean in and capture opportunity as much as possible during COVID, take the opportunity and create new occasions for consumers and really partner with our retailers to make sure we were there for them when they need us with our retail sales folks in store stocking shelves and meeting their product needs when some others couldn't, so clearly all of those things together were really important for us. Now, as we look at that I would say, you know we are \u2013 you know in the past typically might have been 10, 20 basis points of share in a year. Obviously this year 160 basis points of share and you know 130 on our chocolate business where we already have a 45% market share. So as we look into 2021, we believe that the share growth will continue prior to the last, which is really you know basically up to Easter, and post Easter we believe that the share will moderate as we lap those 20 gains, but it's going to be our goal to profitably sustain as much of the share as we can going forward. Yeah, if you look at our M&A strategy, clearly it is focused on us capturing incremental snacking occasions and some of the ways that we look at that is you know clearly we do have a pretty sizeable business in sweet indulgent type products and as we look at consumers broad snacking needs, clearly you know salty savory and better-for-you are opportunities where our portfolio is under developed. And if you look at our past history of acquisition you would see that many of our acquisitions have been focused in that space. You know Skinny Pop is a great example of that. So clearly that is a focus area for us within our M&A strategy. Yeah, I mean it is difficult in a year like this past year to precisely pinpoint exact amounts to any one factor, just because there was so much going on. I mean clearly we know supply chain was a piece of it. You know frankly though we also believe how we pivoted our portfolio and really shifted spending and shifted focus on our portfolio to the exact right items that consumers were looking for, you know the role that we were able to focus on with season and how much that resonated with consumers during that time.  So it's difficult to pinpoint \u2013 you know there were opportunities for products on shelves, and so I guess I would say you know I think it's fair to say some of that was probably short term benefits and then there are other components that have somewhat of a longer lasting effect. So for example, if you do well in a season one year and your sell-through was quite strong, typically the buy that you get from retailers the next year tends to be pretty strong as well.  You know if you're able to gain shelf space and get incremental items on shelves, typically if they're performing well, you have the opportunity to keep them on a sustained basis. So, well some of the benefits I think are short term, others will have that enduring effect."

Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great, thanks so much. Good morning, everybody.\nMichele Buck: Good morning, Andrew.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Hi. I'm curious, for the past several years, Michele, the majority, if not all, of the company's organic sales growth has come really from pricing, as opposed to volume or consumption growth, and much of this is obviously due to the success of the company's new pricing model and the associated volume elasticity that comes with it. I guess, that said, as you look forward into '21 and beyond I'm curious if there is a sort of focus internally on maybe regaining some better balance between the two drivers, and if so, would you expect to see some of that maybe develop more fully next year? Thanks so much.\nMichele Buck: Yes, Andrew, absolutely. I think we've shared before that we do view pricing as an important part of our growth algorithm, but we are very focused and would like to drive to greater balance between price and volume. We have good visibility into Q4 and 2021, and we do expect volume trends to improve. Part of that will be us lapping some of our pricing elasticity from last year, and also a continuation of some of the strong share gains that we've seen to date that will carry into the first part of next year. I think you can definitely count on seeing volume being a more important part of the algorithm next year, and we feel good that the calendar of programming we have, the innovation, the media is really going to help to drive some of that.\nAndrew Lazar: Great, thanks very much.\nMichele Buck: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thank you. Along the same lines of 2021, if I can, Michele, you pulled back a little bit on advertising this quarter. It's been a little up and down this year for understandable reasons. I'm just curious what your thoughts are in general on what the company's plan is for advertising and marketing in general as you get into what hopefully will be a more normal year in 2021.\nMichele Buck: Sure. So we definitely believe in investing in our brand. That is a critical piece of our growth model and the business. So clearly, as we mentioned to you, we had pulled back on some spend in areas where we just thought, given the pandemic, it didn't make sense. For example, in refreshment, where we knew consumer usage was down significantly, but as we look to 2021, and as we've started to see the momentum that we're seeing and some of the recovery, we definitely plan on taking our investment levels to where we would like them to be, and more in line with where they have been historically. So you'll see us really gleaning in to drive the consumer and to leverage some of the behaviors that we're seeing.\nKen Goldman: Thank you, and then for a follow-up, you didn't do any share repurchases this quarter. I think that's the first time in two years, and that was -- the last time was right before you bought Pirate's Booty. I want to ask if the lack of repo is an indication of a pending deal of course, but I am curious how you would describe the current environment for potential transactions. I guess particularly are targets maybe more willing to sell because they can do so off a higher sales number than usual, or are they more hesitant because they I guess kind of want to ride this demand wave as long as they can?\nMichele Buck: Steve, do you want to take that one?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, I'd be happy to. So first, just on the share repurchase, I will just echo what you said. Don't read anything into that. I would say for this year we have taken a little bit more cautious approach to liquidity in general, going back to the beginning of the year, and the COVID phase, just taking a little bit more cautious approach. We will be revisiting that as we look at next year, and I would say in general our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. With respect to M&A specifically, it's probably more the latter. I think people are still -- the ones that are the most interesting are riding the wave, and they still have valuation expectations that look like they did pre-COVID, if not higher, but I would say we're continuing to have an active funnel, continue to look at a number of opportunities, and we'll continue to update the market as appropriate.\nKen Goldman: Great, thank you both.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thank you. I think the recovery expected in 2021 in International and Other is -- you have a 2% headwind this year in 2020, but can you give us a little bit of color as to the condition of your business in Mexico, and India, and China, and is it easy to assume that things can go back to normal or has the pandemic impaired your commercial capabilities at all or the retailers' desire to merchandise confectionary products in those markets?\nMichele Buck: Yes, so first of all, I'd start by saying certainly there's a lot of uncertainty and volatility with the pandemic. We all know that we're seeing the ups and downs of occasional increases and spikes in markets around the globe. That said, I would say that we were pleasantly surprised by our performance in International. Our team did a great job executing in this very challenging environment, and I think that we've seen, while each market is a little different and the use of the category is a little bit different, consumers are really looking during this time for brands they trust, and we've done a great job over the past couple of years building the Hershey equity. So we were pleased with the rebound we saw in many of our markets. I think in mentioned in India our business was up 6% versus it had been doing. We gained market share across almost every market on our core chocolate category. So I wouldn't say that we believe our ability to drive the business has been impaired in any market on a permanent basis. Just as we are pivoting in the U.S., I think we've pivoted to where the opportunities are in international, and we feel good about the recovery, and plan to deliver against that.\nRobert Moskow: Thanks. Can I dive a little bit deeper into Mexico, are there any packaging requirements that the government is making on nutritional values or any concerns about the category, how that might impact the category?\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. So the government did put in place front-of-pack labeling changes in Mexico, and that new packaging is now in the market, and we are beginning to monitor the trend. We believe consumers know our category is a treat, they know it has sugar, and so, we expect that we'll see less impact from that than perhaps other categories will, but we will, of course, keep a close eye on that, and I would say Mexico has been one of the harder-hit developing markets relative to COVID. So, we feel good about the progress we're seeing, but it's a little slower than some of the other markets.\nRobert Moskow: Okay, very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. A question on your share gains in the U.S., and particularly in chocolate. You really, and in your prepared remarks, you touched on this how adaptive you were by market, by channel, by need state and then in terms of S'mores, and some of that is related or might be related to supply chain. Could you talk about that part of it? And then I think the reason I'm asking is because if there is a supply chain breakdown or lack of adaptability by a competitor maybe that will represent share gains that they can reverse somewhat in '21, and I have a follow-up.\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. So I would say I believe our share gains are a testament to both our strong brands, our consumer understanding our programming as well as to the supply chain execution, and execution at retail, both of which tend to be core advantages for us as a company. So I think we're seeing our categories and our brands are definitely resonating with consumers, and as you mentioned, we really pivoted with the consumer. So very early on we tried to understand how consumer behavior was changing, and we've talked to all of you before about the fact that our category split is a third, a third, a third take-home, instant consumable, and seasonal. And as we saw consumers shift to more at-home behaviors we very early on shifted the focus in our portfolio to really dial up S'mores, Twizzlers for movie nights, our baking product activity, and then within the season, even with Halloween we made that decision to lean in, and drive, and build a Halloween season versus back away from it, and everything related to that relative to let's set the season early so we can get consumers in, in pre Trick-or-Treat, let's make sure we were smart about the portfolio that's out there, and not overly index to seasonal skews, et cetera, and then we worked really hard on messaging, to message consumers safe ways to celebrate the holiday. We dialed up ecommerce as consumers shifted to ecommerce, and because we had invested in capabilities in that we were able to do that. And then I think a lot of the strong investments we've made in other capabilities over the years helped us during this time to execute well, and some of those go beyond supply chain. So we've made investments in better understanding consumer trends. We've made investments in our ability to forecast at a much more granular level. We've made media investments to target better, and certainly we've invested in our plants all along the way, which really enabled us to pivot quickly to safety protocol, and really be able to continue to execute, and then we made the decision to keep our retail sales team at retail sales. As I think about that share gain, I would clearly -- we would expect to continue to see share gains clearly through the spring of '21. We would expect that they would moderate after that, that we're certainly expecting to hold on to share, and we will continue to drive our outstanding programming, and also continue to execute supply chain with excellence.\nDavid Palmer: That's helpful. Thank you, and then, just on -- any sort of one-times from this year that we should be thinking about from model perspective, I'm thinking about COVID related friction costs this year, but also you might add back some SG&A in parts and other -- so, any one-time type comparisons that we should think about. Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. I think we talked about it in the prepared remarks. On the top line, we had about a two point impact. So, you can right away say there's a drop through that two point in profitability, but then if you take a look at the net of costs for COVID, so protective equipment and employee incentives that we had early in the year, and you net them against the DME optimization, the BD optimization that we did, as well as the T&E savings, it was a net -- slight positive on those two pieces, and so, that, we would expect to mostly go away. We'll have some lingering costs next year, probably less one-off in any quarter related to COVID, PP&E and so forth that continue, but net, it was just a slight positive outside of the 2 point drag on the top line.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Growe: Hi, good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nChris Growe: Hi. I had a question for you. If I look back at Halloween, I'm curious if you slipped this season apart, and you had given some information on this last quarter, sort of the early season part and the Trick-or-Treat season part, kind of how each piece performed, if you can give a little color on that? We have some information from IRI, but I'm curious if you have better information than we have, and then, I'm also curious, as I think about that early part, if that's more indicative of what you expect for the holiday season as you move into Christmas and that kind of time where you don't have a Trick-or-Treat event. Can that early season, if you start that season early in particular in stores, be more like what we saw in the early part of Halloween, if that makes sense?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So, clearly, we saw that within the season, the early part of the season performed more strongly, and the later part that's more Trick-or-Treat focused performed a little bit softer. Now, we had anticipated that. So, overall, the season performed exactly in line with our expectations. As we look at the total season, we were quite pleased that our sales were actually up versus a year ago as was our sell-through up versus a year ago. So, during a time of the global pandemic I think it speaks to the resiliency of the category, and the consumers' desire to really hold on to and continue to celebrate the traditions, and fun occasions like this in their family lives. As we look at holiday, holiday has some different consumer dynamics than Halloween, and so, we believe it will behave a little differently. I don't think we're going to have some of the pressure that we anticipated coming into Halloween. The category should be quite strong. Consumers use the product in different ways. It's much more about family occasions. We aren't as big in gifting some of the areas of the category that might be a little bit more hard-hit. So, we expect solid results given that skew to at-home consumption.\nChris Growe: Okay, thank you, and now, just to follow onto that, are you shipping in holiday products early, and would that have been an incremental benefit -- do we see some of that in the third quarter more than we would have seen historically?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, we did -- just like we did with Halloween; started shipping in holiday a bit early, so you do get some pick-up in the third quarter for that, that will take away a little bit from the fourth quarter. Yes, maybe on the order, you have 50 basis points, and we also do that to drive the consumer behavior early as well, just as we did with Halloween, as Halloween was still on the floor, holiday was also out there, so that consumers could also gravitate to the holiday pretty quickly.\nChris Growe: A first symbol of\u2026 [Multiple speakers]\nMichele Buck: Yes, strong Halloween sell-through really helps us because it helps us get that fast start to holidays because it clears the space to be able to put holiday on the floor.\nChris Growe: Okay. Thanks so much for the color there.\nMichele Buck: Absolutely.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJason English: Hey, good morning folks. Congratulations on a good quarter first of all.\nMichele Buck: Thank you.\nJason English: I want to pick up on the back of Chris' questions and tease out little bit more of the outlook on holidays going forward. The Halloween early part selling was phenomenally smarter much than I think any of us expected. I think a big part of that is due to the merchandizing programs that retailers had. Think they started bigger and earlier than they usually do. Has that you think influenced how they are going to approach other seasons going forward? Said more directly, you expect retailers to provide more merchandising power behind the category into holiday, into Easter than they otherwise would coming out of the success we saw in Halloween?\nMichele Buck: So, we've always had pretty strong merchandizing support at every season, and one thing we always think about with season is when we get it on the floor because we know that consumers will buy that holiday or seasonal product whether it's Easter wherever early for in-home consumption. If you get it out there, it kind of sparks the trigger of fun moments earlier. So, I don't know that I could say specifically that we can anticipate that retailers are going to merchandize it even more than they ever have. I do think that they will be focused on making sure that they definitely get it out early to capture the early part of the season since that is the piece that is a bit more stable. There were a few retailers as you can imagine with the uncertainty of Halloween and the fact that all these decisions about what to do with Halloween really had to be made in early May when things were quite uncertain and schools were closed and bars and restaurants and all of that. So, there are few retailers who had pulled back on Halloween, and based on the results of the season this year, they will likely have more confidence going forward which should help to make even stronger Halloween next year and probably also build confidence for the other seasons like Easter.\nJason English: That makes a lot of sense, and then, one more question on the -- I am sticking with follow-on to Chris' questions which I thought was solid. The early part of the season versus the later part of the season, the early part of the season was exceptionally robust, and you said late part was a bit softer, but somewhere in your remarks I think you said all in total holiday, so both earlier part and late part finished mid single digits for the category. I think bathetically to get the category down in single digits, we're going to have to see some pretty sharp declines coming through the retail sales data in the next couple of weeks as we capture that late part of the season. Am I thinking about it right? Am I interpreting your comments correctly?\nMichele Buck: Yes. Yes, you are interpreting them correctly. So, category was down mid single digit overall as much as our business was actually up, and, we will see some of those declines.\nJason English: Okay, thank you very much.\nMichele Buck: One other thing that to just keep in mind, there is a little bit of a timing impact from the Nielsen and IRI data given the season was on the Saturday versus on Thursday and based on retail reported days. So, you'll probably even see it's down even more, and you'll have to wait till kind of mid November till you see some of those last couple of days being reported. So, some of it when you see will be just the timing shift of the day of the week, and some of it will certainly be the declines in Trick-or-Treat at the end.\nJason English: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with DD Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Driscoll: Great, thank you. Good morning and congratulations on the great execution in the quarter.\nMichele Buck: Thanks David.\nDavid Driscoll: I had -- so two questions. The first one -- just two relatively small ones on the other expense commentary, I think the year-to-date period other expense is only very small number, but your full-year projection $100 - $110 million on that means it's a fairly massive number in the fourth quarter. Am I doing the math right? Is that correct on how the time lays up for other expense? And then related just another follow-up on your volumes expected in the fourth quarter, I think in your prepared comments, you said North American organic growth similar to third quarter are pricing only a half point. So that would mean volume is something like five percentage points positive in the fourth quarter. Am I doing those two piece right? Any color you can give on those two comments?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, I would be happy to do. So, on the tax side and other expense, you're exactly right. We will have a large other expense in the fourth quarter. Now that's consistent with what we have been seeing even in the early guidance earlier in the year, and then along with that, a lower tax rate in the fourth quarter to do the math on the tax rate you also have to solve for a lower tax rate, so that's how those two lines will play out, and yes, on the volume up in the fourth quarter, you're thinking about it the right way. We do have some inventory replenishment that will happen in the fourth quarter. We saw that in the third. We'll see some more of that or that continue into the fourth. We're also lapping some elasticity after the price increase last year and in this continued strong share gains. Those three things are part of driving that fourth quarter volume.\nDavid Driscoll: Michele, like bigger picture question, first, you took pricing in most of the portfolio outside of seasonal candies in 2018 and then in 2019. Given the negative impacts to Halloween for the entire category, would you agree that now is probably not the time for seasonal price increase actions, maybe this gets delayed to 2022 or sometime later until we get a normal consumer environment? Essentially, I'm just asking you to assess your ability to pass through cost increases through pricing actions. It's a weird environment, and I don't know how it's altered that calculus. Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yes. So, obviously, I can't speak to any specifics about our specific -- any upcoming specific pricing actions. What I can say is there's been no change to our pricing strategy of smaller, more frequent increases, and that doesn't necessarily mean we're going to have the same amount of pricing every year or that we would always announce pricing at the same time. We did, for example, actually have a small price increase this past year on our food service business in the third quarter. So, if we look over time, we have been able to price at various times, at various economic conditions. So what's important to us is we do think pricing is an important part of our algorithm, but as we've talked about before, we really want to grow through balanced growth across levers, distribution, velocity, innovation, price, et cetera. So, we know that that is certainly the one piece of the portfolio that we have not yet priced, and I think it's fair to say that given that we haven't announced a price increase at this moment in time, the magnitude of pricing in 2021 would be less than we've seen in prior years at least at this point. We've been pleased that we've seen conversion be pretty good this year, even in a very difficult economic environment, and I think that continues to demonstrate what we've seen over the years, which is the category is very resilient. Our brands are strong. We continue to invest into our brands and that does allow us for an even greater amount of pricing power.\nDavid Driscoll: Really helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hi, thanks. Good morning, I guess building somewhat on earlier questions, I'd love a little bit more color around your general mindset heading into 2021 as you work through your planning process. Clearly there are parts of your business that have been under pressure this year, international, movie theaters, vending specialty, et cetera, and hopefully all those set up for at least directional recovery in the year ahead, but at the same time you've been gaining a lot of share, you've had great success in at-home categories like baking and with initiatives like S'mores, all of which is fantastic momentum, but again could set up for difficult year-over-year comparisons. So, as you size it all together, I guess, is there a way to frame your thinking at a summary level to what degree those various puts and takes sort of just met each other out in your mind? Or are you approaching 2021 planning thinking we've got either a net easier or a net harder set up versus what one like it sort of typical? Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Yes, so, we're pleased with the momentums that we are seeing, and I would say, your call-outs in what you shared about some of the ups and downs on the business, I think, are very accurate. We believe we're seeing that our category and our brands really resonate with consumers and especially at a time like this, where they're looking for some of those moments of goodness, moments of happiness. We're really pleased with how we've been able to pivot with the consumer and also pivot with our capabilities to be able to execute within this environment, and we feel good about that momentum and our ability to continue pivoting. So, this year, obviously, it was consumer shifted to take home, and so, we dialed up S'mores and we dialed up Twizzlers and we dialed up baking, and we leaned in to create the season to make sure that we could capture that opportunity giving consumers new ways to participate in Halloween that frankly we believe those things like candy slides and candy graveyards, and all the creative things people did, will probably become a part of their ongoing traditions, and they have just evolved. As I mentioned, we were able to dial in and accelerate e-commerce, and I think as we look to next year, we're prepared if the consumer pivots yet again to be able to pivot with them, I think we've built and we've demonstrated ability to execute well during this environment, and also to pivot from an executional perspective, whether it's at retail, or in our manufacturing facility. So we're very focused on that, we've captured as well some cultural, positive effects, I think capabilities we've built in terms of operating in this environment that perhaps allow us to make decisions more quickly, and we think that is an enabler for us going forward. So we feel good about that as we look to the future.\nSteve Powers: Thanks for that, Michele. I don't know if you want to take this one or Steve, but just as a follow-up, sort of unrelated, just any comments you might have on just current levels of promotion, the promotional environment, what you expect to see over the balance of 4Q and into '21? Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Yes, we don't see any significant change relative to promotional activity. We didn't really see it this year, we didn't execute anything significantly differently, and nor do we expect to see anything in the future.\nSteve Powers: Okay, perfect. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.\nNik Modi: Yes, good morning everyone. Michele, I was hoping you could provide some context on the partnership with Google that you use during the Halloween period, and do you believe this capability can be leveraged for this holiday season, but also kind of in your everyday business, as you kind of look forward?\nMichele Buck: We're continuing to leverage different types of data and analytic and insights more and more across the business, and we continue to really try and stay on top of tracking consumer sentiment, and leveraging data and analytics to tailor copy to tailor messaging to tailor media. So more and more, we're operating at a more sophisticated level relative to using multiple data sources, and also using that to reach consumers at the right places, with the right message at the right time.\nNik Modi: And I guess what I'm trying to get at is, is this kind of new way of kind of targeting consumers like the return that you see from what you've done like, can you just give us any kind of understanding, because one thing I'm noticing across the entire CPG landscape is, companies are spending more money, but they're spending more money on the same message, and in fact, new consumers are being recruited, usage occasions are changing, and so it really requires a change in how you talk to those consumers, and so I find this, Google partnership incredibly compelling for you guys. So I'm just trying to get better context on how it's changing the return profile of your spend, you can provide any context on that?\nMichele Buck: So we have a continuous focus on optimizing media and the returns on our media, we always have, we've had strong media ROI forever, and our challenges, how do we keep making them better, and then we continuously optimize based on that. So right now, it's a big spend area for us. So it's an area we're very focused on elevating, and it is about you making sure right now, I would say some of the biggest opportunity is that opportunity of even more precise targeting, and then once you have that target, the ability to alter the message so and then we alter our media mix accordingly, and I would say we see significant movement in that mix on a year-to-year basis as we get better at that, I think we've raised some of the opportunities of how we've gone just very deep relative to specific seasons, whether it's the S'mores by zip code, or whether it's specific holidays and looking at sell-through at the store level basis to be able to dial-up media on a zip code level basis. So you'll continue to see more of that, frankly, that's just becoming a way of how we operate now.\nNik Modi: Great, and last question, just from an innovation standpoint, can you just provide any context on kind of what's remaining in terms of innovation this year, and how things are going to work in 2021, if there's any clarity you can provide on the launch timing?\nMichele Buck: Yes, so we feel very good about our innovation. Some of the innovations that we're excited about that are new to the market include the Reese pretzel product, a Reese cup with pretzels in it. We've had a range of Kit Kat flavors. We know on a global basis a big part of the Kit Kat portfolio, our flavors, they tend to do quite well. We are on a very small level launching snack cakes under our Reese's trademark which delivers that Reese experience in a slightly different type of product form, and we feel good on that, versus based on some of the early test results, and we will have more coming. Some items on our take-home side of our business, that won't get announced till early next year which is typically the time we announce those things just given reset windows. No major change in our innovation strategy. We think it's working very well for us, we think its right-sized, and we think it's delivering much more sustainable results.\nNik Modi: Great, I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: You've talked about the increase in ecommerce sales, even if it might have decelerated a little bit, but it's up very strongly. You've said in the past that basket and dollar rings are higher online. Is that still holding true with the growth that you're seeing now? And on the margin side, you've mentioned that there's a small gap, but that you were narrowing it and that scale would help that. Is that coming along the way that would have expected, how does that look now?\nMichele Buck: Yes, I mean we've generally seen larger basket sizes in general across most channels this year as people are doing fewer trips and more quantity per trip. So I think that's been somewhat of just an underlying dynamic given the pandemic impact in the marketplace. For us, on our ecommerce business, we've seen very significant growth across the board, but particularly in click-and-collect where people actually go and pick up their groceries, and also in the local delivery models as well versus kind of national deliver. The margins that we have are similar to what we see in bricks-and-mortar.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. That's helpful.\nMichele Buck: In those two areas -- excuse me, in those two areas where we have similar products, obviously, that we sell in bricks-and-mortar.\nMichael Lavery: Right.\nMichele Buck: Steve, anything you want to add?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, I would say is that, we've said in the past, that overall, ecommerce margins are a little bit dilutive, and it's there, as Michele just said, in click-and-collect and local delivery very similar, not much impact, and that's probably two-thirds of our ecommerce business. The piece that is more dilutive is the ship-to-home, and in particular cold ship, and that's an area where we continue to work with our customers and look at our overall investment with those customers and joint business planning to drive efficiencies over time so that those margins align.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, thanks, and I just want to follow up on S'mores. I thought that your data analysis and insight there to push that the way that you did was interesting. As you're seeing cases rise again now are you replicating that? Are you seeing similar results? Is there a S'mores surge we should expect, and that would be it be right to assume that those Hershey Milk Chocolate Bars are probably some of the highest margin ones that you have?\nMichele Buck: So we have really expanded S'mores from at one point it was a very focused time of year to really capturing S'mores as a year-round opportunity especially if you think about how different weather is across the entire country. There are lots of opportunities to continue to expand that. So we're very focused on that. We're also very focused on the upcoming baking season, where we know that consumers will be spending time at home. It's already a natural baking season, and so, we'll be looking to really optimize what we're able to drive leveraging insights around that season as well. \nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Spillane: Hi, good morning, everyone. So just one question for me, and I think there was a little bit of a commentary in the prepared remarks about some -- inflation in cost of goods sold. So maybe, Steve, could you just give us a kind of a lay of the land right now in terms of what commodity costs, and just cost of goods inflation looks like currently? In the context it seems like freight costs are going up. You've had some competitors talk about cocoa prices going up. So, just trying to get an understanding of directionally where inflation is headed right now.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yes, for us, I'd say overall, it's been relatively stable; so, on the commodity side, relatively stable. You saw big movements in commodities across Q2 and Q3, and of course we've talked in the past week -- mitigate some of that volatility with our hedging program, and I would say today they're fairly stable. There are increases in freight costs. There too, our team do a great job of longer term contracting which helps mitigate some of that increase. So, that hasn't been a real material impact for us. We have seen some increased warehousing cost, and part of that's volume and flow through along with the share gains and the volume increases that we've seen. So, we called that out in the prepared remarks, but in total, at least sitting at this point, we'd say overall COGS is fairly stable, and we'll get more guidance on 2021 when we get onto the fourth quarter call.\nBryan Spillane: But, I guess we could infer from that, at least from where we sit today that at stable -- is something that looks like it kind of carries into next year unless something changes.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, I think that's fair. Next year, as we get the -- you're going to have the 2020 and 2021 crops of cocoa start to bear the LID. So, there's that to consider, and then, there's other things obviously on the gross margin side as Michele said, a little bit more volume-driven than price-driven mix driving growth margin, next year we'll have our continuing productivity goal, and again, a lot more on that to come when we talk on the fourth quarter call.\nBryan Spillane: All right, thanks, Steve. That's very helpful. Have a happy Thanksgiving everyone.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning. Thanks for the question.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nJohn Baumgartner: Michele, I like to follow up on the Reese's snack cake. You mentioned that it's small right now, but Hershey went down this path about 15 years ago, and it didn't really translate into anything material. So, I'm curious what the data tells you in terms of changes in the landscape now. Does this maybe mark a new phase of the snack section evolution? I guess where do you think it slots in? I mean does it compete against the Twinkies or cookies, just where's the target market? Any big picture of thoughts would be appreciated.\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. So, I think we've approached this in a very thoughtful and measured way, which was not a mass launch where we just threw it out there and tried to make it as big as we possibly could at one point in time, but we did a very targeted in-market launch for an extended period of time, so that we could really learn about the proposition. We spent a lot of time in terms of developing the product to make sure that we really understood some of the drivers of liking in the snack cake area, and we also really thought about where and how we wanted to play and launch. So, this for example is very C-store focused. It is a single serve type of item. So, we're keeping it as a focused launch. It is definitely bringing the great chocolate and peanut butter taste profile that we have on Reese's to the snack cake market. So, yes, it is playing in that snack cake area versus other snack cake brands. We know that -- we had participated in this category for many years through licensing, and we learned through that that our brands could participate, and extend to the category. We also know that morning snacking has been a growing trend, and our confection items skew more to afternoon and evening. So, this is a chance for us to participate in some of that growth because that is where these snack cakes get utilized. So, again, we're going to be very focused throughout, and we'll put it in locations where we think we can garner incremental space, and where we think there's a strong consumer fit, and starting at c-store and looking at other select areas, and then, if it continues to perform well, we will expand, but we will watch it closely and take a measured approach.\nJohn Baumgartner: Great. Thanks, Michele.\nMichele Buck: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Hi, Alexia.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Hi, Buck. Can I just talk about the C-store channel specifically? It's obviously been under pressure because of the pandemic, but I imagine that that happens in sequential improvement, and [May] [ph], could you maybe just give us some numbers about how that channel is recovering?\nMichele Buck: Absolutely. So, as you said, we've continued to see strength in food, and mass, and dollar as consumers eat more at home. The c-store class did see a bit of recovery in the third quarter. So, we saw the business grow in the low single digits in the third quarter, which is definitely an improvement versus those early pandemic trends. It did then slow a little bit as summer ended and those summer road trips decreased with kids going back to school. Our business has tracked pretty much in line with the channel, and significantly ahead of the category. So, we have share gains of about 120 basis points in Q3 in that channel. So, I'm seeing some rebounds and some recovery versus where it was in the past as people are out and about a little bit more than they were.\nAlexia Howard: Great, and then, as a follow-up -- follow-up actually on Bryan Spillane's question about freight costs, I remember back in 2018 as freight costs spiked back then, that was quite a bit of a headwind for you. It seems as though it's not pretty much of a problem this time around. Are you able to tell us roughly what proportion of COGS freight actually represents, and how much of that is already contracted out, and what you've learned since 2018 to make the situation this time around a bit more manageable? Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. So, yes, freight costs right now, we don't see as a material impact as it continues to rise, it will have a bigger impact right now again because we're contracted and our teams do a great job of managing those contracts, it's not having as material of an impact. It's roughly 10% of COGS overall. So, it's not in material, but right now, not seeing enough movement there given the contracting to really drive a material dock on overall COGS.\nAlexia Howard: Great, thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Feeney: Good morning. Thanks very much, and thanks for a great Halloween, personally and professionally, you know, the leanest of my financial ambitions has been to give out full-sized candy bars, which I was again able to execute. So, thank you. Two quick ones; I noticed in the data, your pricing in North America is plus 19 on the take-away, plus 33 is what you reported. Is that just the math or is there some shrinking or different mix within retailer margins there is my first question. And secondly, historically, when you look at -- today's velocity is generally tomorrow's distribution and your velocity has been fantastic. This is a weird year. A lot of people's velocity is fantastic, but do you anticipate gaining shelf space in that everyday place -- you look at these baking items, you look at these take-home items, like this is phenomenally better velocity, forget about just the total sales that you're seeing there. You anticipate significant share gains, perhaps structural ones, I'm talking share of shelf here as retailers do resets for holiday and -- going forward. Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Sure. So, two parts to your question, the first was around price and some of the discrepancy, and yes, there is a mix impact. Honestly, it might be best if Melissa goes and takes you through a deep dive on that because there's some complexity associated with it, but the P&L is definitely accurate. As it relates to velocity, yes, good velocity -- I like your phrase today's velocity is tomorrow's distribution, I do think that's very accurate. As we look at the seasons, you asked about holiday, we certainly have been able to garner incremental distribution, incremental SKUs throughout the year both in terms of everyday and seasons because we've been able to deliver, and the items that we then put on shelf, not only could we supply them but then they moved. So, we do feel good about that. We'll continue to take a very disciplined approach, and be very careful that we don't over-skew. So, we really have to look at the productivity of every skew, and as long as it's good, we will be there, but yes, we have been able to gain some distribution, and going forward, I anticipate that we will continue to be able to perhaps even through the first quarter of next year.\nJonathan Feeney: Thanks very much, and I'll follow up with Melissa.\nMichele Buck: Very good.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with BMO. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Zaslow: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning, Ken.\nKen Zaslow: I just have one quick question. Everything has been asked and answered. You made a reference in the prepared remarks about [indiscernible] is tracking ahead of your strategic plans. Can you talk about what are the key learnings that you've developed through your years as a CEO that has really helped you kind of make this a better acquisition and implement it? What are your key learnings, and what do you take forward to future acquisitions?\nMichele Buck: Well, so, I think a lot of learnings along the way, I guess I would start with there's a business model for brands that we as a company are best with, and that is branded items where -- brand matters, where the business has significant scale, probably close to that $100 million mark, and it needs to be a business that has a high growth margin because that's what our business model is. We're a branded company, we invest a lot in marketing, and we have high margins that enable us to kind of invest and grow, invest and grow, and that's our model. That's what we need. So, I think that was one of the biggest learnings was to help us select the asset. I think secondly, really understanding the strengths of the brand and really being able to do the right deep dive on which KPIs we think predict the ability for a brand to scale, and then, I would say really trying to scale the business well, and I would say hey, we've learned lessons the whole way along the way. As you know, in the past, we bought some businesses that were too small, we bought some businesses that had lower margins, and we had some that we perhaps didn't execute on the scaling as well, and I think we've had a very focused effort on the scaling as well, and we've gotten much better at that relative to supply chain, relative to the talent that we need when we buy a company like this where we want to keep the entrepreneurial spirit, we want to keep people who know the brand and the business, but we also have to be focused on the point that -- we're also at a point where we want to scale the business. I mean I'd go back to the scale, the branded nature, the high margin are probably the biggest ones, and then picking the right underlying KPIs that say it's a sustainable business, because if we can do that, we can make in some.\nKen Zaslow: Great, I really appreciate it.

            "content": "Good morning. Yes, I'd be happy to. So first, just on the share repurchase, I will just echo what you said. Don't read anything into that. I would say for this year we have taken a little bit more cautious approach to liquidity in general, going back to the beginning of the year, and the COVID phase, just taking a little bit more cautious approach. We will be revisiting that as we look at next year, and I would say in general our capital allocation priorities haven't changed. With respect to M&A specifically, it's probably more the latter. I think people are still -- the ones that are the most interesting are riding the wave, and they still have valuation expectations that look like they did pre-COVID, if not higher, but I would say we're continuing to have an active funnel, continue to look at a number of opportunities, and we'll continue to update the market as appropriate. Yes. I think we talked about it in the prepared remarks. On the top line, we had about a two point impact. So, you can right away say there's a drop through that two point in profitability, but then if you take a look at the net of costs for COVID, so protective equipment and employee incentives that we had early in the year, and you net them against the DME optimization, the BD optimization that we did, as well as the T&E savings, it was a net -- slight positive on those two pieces, and so, that, we would expect to mostly go away. We'll have some lingering costs next year, probably less one-off in any quarter related to COVID, PP&E and so forth that continue, but net, it was just a slight positive outside of the 2 point drag on the top line. Yes, we did -- just like we did with Halloween; started shipping in holiday a bit early, so you do get some pick-up in the third quarter for that, that will take away a little bit from the fourth quarter. Yes, maybe on the order, you have 50 basis points, and we also do that to drive the consumer behavior early as well, just as we did with Halloween, as Halloween was still on the floor, holiday was also out there, so that consumers could also gravitate to the holiday pretty quickly. Yes, I would be happy to do. So, on the tax side and other expense, you're exactly right. We will have a large other expense in the fourth quarter. Now that's consistent with what we have been seeing even in the early guidance earlier in the year, and then along with that, a lower tax rate in the fourth quarter to do the math on the tax rate you also have to solve for a lower tax rate, so that's how those two lines will play out, and yes, on the volume up in the fourth quarter, you're thinking about it the right way. We do have some inventory replenishment that will happen in the fourth quarter. We saw that in the third. We'll see some more of that or that continue into the fourth. We're also lapping some elasticity after the price increase last year and in this continued strong share gains. Those three things are part of driving that fourth quarter volume. Good morning. Yes, I would say is that, we've said in the past, that overall, ecommerce margins are a little bit dilutive, and it's there, as Michele just said, in click-and-collect and local delivery very similar, not much impact, and that's probably two-thirds of our ecommerce business. The piece that is more dilutive is the ship-to-home, and in particular cold ship, and that's an area where we continue to work with our customers and look at our overall investment with those customers and joint business planning to drive efficiencies over time so that those margins align. Sure. Yes, for us, I'd say overall, it's been relatively stable; so, on the commodity side, relatively stable. You saw big movements in commodities across Q2 and Q3, and of course we've talked in the past week -- mitigate some of that volatility with our hedging program, and I would say today they're fairly stable. There are increases in freight costs. There too, our team do a great job of longer term contracting which helps mitigate some of that increase. So, that hasn't been a real material impact for us. We have seen some increased warehousing cost, and part of that's volume and flow through along with the share gains and the volume increases that we've seen. So, we called that out in the prepared remarks, but in total, at least sitting at this point, we'd say overall COGS is fairly stable, and we'll get more guidance on 2021 when we get onto the fourth quarter call. Yes, I think that's fair. Next year, as we get the -- you're going to have the 2020 and 2021 crops of cocoa start to bear the LID. So, there's that to consider, and then, there's other things obviously on the gross margin side as Michele said, a little bit more volume-driven than price-driven mix driving growth margin, next year we'll have our continuing productivity goal, and again, a lot more on that to come when we talk on the fourth quarter call. Thank you. Good morning. Good morning. Sure. So, yes, freight costs right now, we don't see as a material impact as it continues to rise, it will have a bigger impact right now again because we're contracted and our teams do a great job of managing those contracts, it's not having as material of an impact. It's roughly 10% of COGS overall. So, it's not in material, but right now, not seeing enough movement there given the contracting to really drive a material dock on overall COGS."

            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Good morning, Andrew. Yes, Andrew, absolutely. I think we've shared before that we do view pricing as an important part of our growth algorithm, but we are very focused and would like to drive to greater balance between price and volume. We have good visibility into Q4 and 2021, and we do expect volume trends to improve. Part of that will be us lapping some of our pricing elasticity from last year, and also a continuation of some of the strong share gains that we've seen to date that will carry into the first part of next year. I think you can definitely count on seeing volume being a more important part of the algorithm next year, and we feel good that the calendar of programming we have, the innovation, the media is really going to help to drive some of that. Thank you. Sure. So we definitely believe in investing in our brand. That is a critical piece of our growth model and the business. So clearly, as we mentioned to you, we had pulled back on some spend in areas where we just thought, given the pandemic, it didn't make sense. For example, in refreshment, where we knew consumer usage was down significantly, but as we look to 2021, and as we've started to see the momentum that we're seeing and some of the recovery, we definitely plan on taking our investment levels to where we would like them to be, and more in line with where they have been historically. So you'll see us really gleaning in to drive the consumer and to leverage some of the behaviors that we're seeing. Steve, do you want to take that one? Yes, so first of all, I'd start by saying certainly there's a lot of uncertainty and volatility with the pandemic. We all know that we're seeing the ups and downs of occasional increases and spikes in markets around the globe. That said, I would say that we were pleasantly surprised by our performance in International. Our team did a great job executing in this very challenging environment, and I think that we've seen, while each market is a little different and the use of the category is a little bit different, consumers are really looking during this time for brands they trust, and we've done a great job over the past couple of years building the Hershey equity. So we were pleased with the rebound we saw in many of our markets. I think in mentioned in India our business was up 6% versus it had been doing. We gained market share across almost every market on our core chocolate category. So I wouldn't say that we believe our ability to drive the business has been impaired in any market on a permanent basis. Just as we are pivoting in the U.S., I think we've pivoted to where the opportunities are in international, and we feel good about the recovery, and plan to deliver against that. Yes, absolutely. So the government did put in place front-of-pack labeling changes in Mexico, and that new packaging is now in the market, and we are beginning to monitor the trend. We believe consumers know our category is a treat, they know it has sugar, and so, we expect that we'll see less impact from that than perhaps other categories will, but we will, of course, keep a close eye on that, and I would say Mexico has been one of the harder-hit developing markets relative to COVID. So, we feel good about the progress we're seeing, but it's a little slower than some of the other markets. Yes, absolutely. So I would say I believe our share gains are a testament to both our strong brands, our consumer understanding our programming as well as to the supply chain execution, and execution at retail, both of which tend to be core advantages for us as a company. So I think we're seeing our categories and our brands are definitely resonating with consumers, and as you mentioned, we really pivoted with the consumer. So very early on we tried to understand how consumer behavior was changing, and we've talked to all of you before about the fact that our category split is a third, a third, a third take-home, instant consumable, and seasonal. And as we saw consumers shift to more at-home behaviors we very early on shifted the focus in our portfolio to really dial up S'mores, Twizzlers for movie nights, our baking product activity, and then within the season, even with Halloween we made that decision to lean in, and drive, and build a Halloween season versus back away from it, and everything related to that relative to let's set the season early so we can get consumers in, in pre Trick-or-Treat, let's make sure we were smart about the portfolio that's out there, and not overly index to seasonal skews, et cetera, and then we worked really hard on messaging, to message consumers safe ways to celebrate the holiday. We dialed up ecommerce as consumers shifted to ecommerce, and because we had invested in capabilities in that we were able to do that. And then I think a lot of the strong investments we've made in other capabilities over the years helped us during this time to execute well, and some of those go beyond supply chain. So we've made investments in better understanding consumer trends. We've made investments in our ability to forecast at a much more granular level. We've made media investments to target better, and certainly we've invested in our plants all along the way, which really enabled us to pivot quickly to safety protocol, and really be able to continue to execute, and then we made the decision to keep our retail sales team at retail sales. As I think about that share gain, I would clearly -- we would expect to continue to see share gains clearly through the spring of '21. We would expect that they would moderate after that, that we're certainly expecting to hold on to share, and we will continue to drive our outstanding programming, and also continue to execute supply chain with excellence. Good morning. Yes. So, clearly, we saw that within the season, the early part of the season performed more strongly, and the later part that's more Trick-or-Treat focused performed a little bit softer. Now, we had anticipated that. So, overall, the season performed exactly in line with our expectations. As we look at the total season, we were quite pleased that our sales were actually up versus a year ago as was our sell-through up versus a year ago. So, during a time of the global pandemic I think it speaks to the resiliency of the category, and the consumers' desire to really hold on to and continue to celebrate the traditions, and fun occasions like this in their family lives. As we look at holiday, holiday has some different consumer dynamics than Halloween, and so, we believe it will behave a little differently. I don't think we're going to have some of the pressure that we anticipated coming into Halloween. The category should be quite strong. Consumers use the product in different ways. It's much more about family occasions. We aren't as big in gifting some of the areas of the category that might be a little bit more hard-hit. So, we expect solid results given that skew to at-home consumption. Yes, strong Halloween sell-through really helps us because it helps us get that fast start to holidays because it clears the space to be able to put holiday on the floor. Absolutely. Thank you. So, we've always had pretty strong merchandizing support at every season, and one thing we always think about with season is when we get it on the floor because we know that consumers will buy that holiday or seasonal product whether it's Easter wherever early for in-home consumption. If you get it out there, it kind of sparks the trigger of fun moments earlier. So, I don't know that I could say specifically that we can anticipate that retailers are going to merchandize it even more than they ever have. I do think that they will be focused on making sure that they definitely get it out early to capture the early part of the season since that is the piece that is a bit more stable. There were a few retailers as you can imagine with the uncertainty of Halloween and the fact that all these decisions about what to do with Halloween really had to be made in early May when things were quite uncertain and schools were closed and bars and restaurants and all of that. So, there are few retailers who had pulled back on Halloween, and based on the results of the season this year, they will likely have more confidence going forward which should help to make even stronger Halloween next year and probably also build confidence for the other seasons like Easter. Yes. Yes, you are interpreting them correctly. So, category was down mid single digit overall as much as our business was actually up, and, we will see some of those declines. One other thing that to just keep in mind, there is a little bit of a timing impact from the Nielsen and IRI data given the season was on the Saturday versus on Thursday and based on retail reported days. So, you'll probably even see it's down even more, and you'll have to wait till kind of mid November till you see some of those last couple of days being reported. So, some of it when you see will be just the timing shift of the day of the week, and some of it will certainly be the declines in Trick-or-Treat at the end. Thanks David. Yes. So, obviously, I can't speak to any specifics about our specific -- any upcoming specific pricing actions. What I can say is there's been no change to our pricing strategy of smaller, more frequent increases, and that doesn't necessarily mean we're going to have the same amount of pricing every year or that we would always announce pricing at the same time. We did, for example, actually have a small price increase this past year on our food service business in the third quarter. So, if we look over time, we have been able to price at various times, at various economic conditions. So what's important to us is we do think pricing is an important part of our algorithm, but as we've talked about before, we really want to grow through balanced growth across levers, distribution, velocity, innovation, price, et cetera. So, we know that that is certainly the one piece of the portfolio that we have not yet priced, and I think it's fair to say that given that we haven't announced a price increase at this moment in time, the magnitude of pricing in 2021 would be less than we've seen in prior years at least at this point. We've been pleased that we've seen conversion be pretty good this year, even in a very difficult economic environment, and I think that continues to demonstrate what we've seen over the years, which is the category is very resilient. Our brands are strong. We continue to invest into our brands and that does allow us for an even greater amount of pricing power. Yes, so, we're pleased with the momentums that we are seeing, and I would say, your call-outs in what you shared about some of the ups and downs on the business, I think, are very accurate. We believe we're seeing that our category and our brands really resonate with consumers and especially at a time like this, where they're looking for some of those moments of goodness, moments of happiness. We're really pleased with how we've been able to pivot with the consumer and also pivot with our capabilities to be able to execute within this environment, and we feel good about that momentum and our ability to continue pivoting. So, this year, obviously, it was consumer shifted to take home, and so, we dialed up S'mores and we dialed up Twizzlers and we dialed up baking, and we leaned in to create the season to make sure that we could capture that opportunity giving consumers new ways to participate in Halloween that frankly we believe those things like candy slides and candy graveyards, and all the creative things people did, will probably become a part of their ongoing traditions, and they have just evolved. As I mentioned, we were able to dial in and accelerate e-commerce, and I think as we look to next year, we're prepared if the consumer pivots yet again to be able to pivot with them, I think we've built and we've demonstrated ability to execute well during this environment, and also to pivot from an executional perspective, whether it's at retail, or in our manufacturing facility. So we're very focused on that, we've captured as well some cultural, positive effects, I think capabilities we've built in terms of operating in this environment that perhaps allow us to make decisions more quickly, and we think that is an enabler for us going forward. So we feel good about that as we look to the future. Yes, we don't see any significant change relative to promotional activity. We didn't really see it this year, we didn't execute anything significantly differently, and nor do we expect to see anything in the future. We're continuing to leverage different types of data and analytic and insights more and more across the business, and we continue to really try and stay on top of tracking consumer sentiment, and leveraging data and analytics to tailor copy to tailor messaging to tailor media. So more and more, we're operating at a more sophisticated level relative to using multiple data sources, and also using that to reach consumers at the right places, with the right message at the right time. So we have a continuous focus on optimizing media and the returns on our media, we always have, we've had strong media ROI forever, and our challenges, how do we keep making them better, and then we continuously optimize based on that. So right now, it's a big spend area for us. So it's an area we're very focused on elevating, and it is about you making sure right now, I would say some of the biggest opportunity is that opportunity of even more precise targeting, and then once you have that target, the ability to alter the message so and then we alter our media mix accordingly, and I would say we see significant movement in that mix on a year-to-year basis as we get better at that, I think we've raised some of the opportunities of how we've gone just very deep relative to specific seasons, whether it's the S'mores by zip code, or whether it's specific holidays and looking at sell-through at the store level basis to be able to dial-up media on a zip code level basis. So you'll continue to see more of that, frankly, that's just becoming a way of how we operate now. Yes, so we feel very good about our innovation. Some of the innovations that we're excited about that are new to the market include the Reese pretzel product, a Reese cup with pretzels in it. We've had a range of Kit Kat flavors. We know on a global basis a big part of the Kit Kat portfolio, our flavors, they tend to do quite well. We are on a very small level launching snack cakes under our Reese's trademark which delivers that Reese experience in a slightly different type of product form, and we feel good on that, versus based on some of the early test results, and we will have more coming. Some items on our take-home side of our business, that won't get announced till early next year which is typically the time we announce those things just given reset windows. No major change in our innovation strategy. We think it's working very well for us, we think its right-sized, and we think it's delivering much more sustainable results. Good morning. Yes, I mean we've generally seen larger basket sizes in general across most channels this year as people are doing fewer trips and more quantity per trip. So I think that's been somewhat of just an underlying dynamic given the pandemic impact in the marketplace. For us, on our ecommerce business, we've seen very significant growth across the board, but particularly in click-and-collect where people actually go and pick up their groceries, and also in the local delivery models as well versus kind of national deliver. The margins that we have are similar to what we see in bricks-and-mortar. In those two areas -- excuse me, in those two areas where we have similar products, obviously, that we sell in bricks-and-mortar. Steve, anything you want to add? So we have really expanded S'mores from at one point it was a very focused time of year to really capturing S'mores as a year-round opportunity especially if you think about how different weather is across the entire country. There are lots of opportunities to continue to expand that. So we're very focused on that. We're also very focused on the upcoming baking season, where we know that consumers will be spending time at home. It's already a natural baking season, and so, we'll be looking to really optimize what we're able to drive leveraging insights around that season as well. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, absolutely. So, I think we've approached this in a very thoughtful and measured way, which was not a mass launch where we just threw it out there and tried to make it as big as we possibly could at one point in time, but we did a very targeted in-market launch for an extended period of time, so that we could really learn about the proposition. We spent a lot of time in terms of developing the product to make sure that we really understood some of the drivers of liking in the snack cake area, and we also really thought about where and how we wanted to play and launch. So, this for example is very C-store focused. It is a single serve type of item. So, we're keeping it as a focused launch. It is definitely bringing the great chocolate and peanut butter taste profile that we have on Reese's to the snack cake market. So, yes, it is playing in that snack cake area versus other snack cake brands. We know that -- we had participated in this category for many years through licensing, and we learned through that that our brands could participate, and extend to the category. We also know that morning snacking has been a growing trend, and our confection items skew more to afternoon and evening. So, this is a chance for us to participate in some of that growth because that is where these snack cakes get utilized. So, again, we're going to be very focused throughout, and we'll put it in locations where we think we can garner incremental space, and where we think there's a strong consumer fit, and starting at c-store and looking at other select areas, and then, if it continues to perform well, we will expand, but we will watch it closely and take a measured approach. Sure. Hi, Alexia. Absolutely. So, as you said, we've continued to see strength in food, and mass, and dollar as consumers eat more at home. The c-store class did see a bit of recovery in the third quarter. So, we saw the business grow in the low single digits in the third quarter, which is definitely an improvement versus those early pandemic trends. It did then slow a little bit as summer ended and those summer road trips decreased with kids going back to school. Our business has tracked pretty much in line with the channel, and significantly ahead of the category. So, we have share gains of about 120 basis points in Q3 in that channel. So, I'm seeing some rebounds and some recovery versus where it was in the past as people are out and about a little bit more than they were. Sure. So, two parts to your question, the first was around price and some of the discrepancy, and yes, there is a mix impact. Honestly, it might be best if Melissa goes and takes you through a deep dive on that because there's some complexity associated with it, but the P&L is definitely accurate. As it relates to velocity, yes, good velocity -- I like your phrase today's velocity is tomorrow's distribution, I do think that's very accurate. As we look at the seasons, you asked about holiday, we certainly have been able to garner incremental distribution, incremental SKUs throughout the year both in terms of everyday and seasons because we've been able to deliver, and the items that we then put on shelf, not only could we supply them but then they moved. So, we do feel good about that. We'll continue to take a very disciplined approach, and be very careful that we don't over-skew. So, we really have to look at the productivity of every skew, and as long as it's good, we will be there, but yes, we have been able to gain some distribution, and going forward, I anticipate that we will continue to be able to perhaps even through the first quarter of next year. Very good. Good morning, Ken. Well, so, I think a lot of learnings along the way, I guess I would start with there's a business model for brands that we as a company are best with, and that is branded items where -- brand matters, where the business has significant scale, probably close to that $100 million mark, and it needs to be a business that has a high growth margin because that's what our business model is. We're a branded company, we invest a lot in marketing, and we have high margins that enable us to kind of invest and grow, invest and grow, and that's our model. That's what we need. So, I think that was one of the biggest learnings was to help us select the asset. I think secondly, really understanding the strengths of the brand and really being able to do the right deep dive on which KPIs we think predict the ability for a brand to scale, and then, I would say really trying to scale the business well, and I would say hey, we've learned lessons the whole way along the way. As you know, in the past, we bought some businesses that were too small, we bought some businesses that had lower margins, and we had some that we perhaps didn't execute on the scaling as well, and I think we've had a very focused effort on the scaling as well, and we've gotten much better at that relative to supply chain, relative to the talent that we need when we buy a company like this where we want to keep the entrepreneurial spirit, we want to keep people who know the brand and the business, but we also have to be focused on the point that -- we're also at a point where we want to scale the business. I mean I'd go back to the scale, the branded nature, the high margin are probably the biggest ones, and then picking the right underlying KPIs that say it's a sustainable business, because if we can do that, we can make in some. Thank you."

Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release. It is now my pleasure to introduce our Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck.\nMichele Buck: Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of the entire Company, we hope you, your colleagues and your loved ones are continuing to stay safe and healthy. We have all experienced significant change and new challenges over these past several months. Things we never predicted are now realities that we are all adapting to. Things we thought would evolve over the course of several years have changed in weeks. I could not be prouder of the Hershey organization for how they have responded. At the center of our culture is the shared believe that Hershey and its people stand for togetherness, integrity, excellence and making a difference. These values have shined even more brightly over the past several months. Our teams have worked together tirelessly to keep each other safe, our supply chain running, our customers\u2019 needs met, and our consumers stocked with snacks that make their lives a little more delicious during these very difficult times. Our teammates have done this with a care and compassion for each other and the communities in which they live, and they are energized and inspired to leverage this moment to drive positive change for the future. I want to thank the entire organization, from retail to manufacturing and across our corporate international and regional offices, for the hard work and commitment they bring every day. The marketplace remains volatile as the virus and consumer behavior evolves. We saw significant changes as we progressed through the second quarter, but our teams did a fantastic job of adapting to these changes and continued to execute exceptionally well. The first half of the quarter was particularly challenging, as global economic growth contracted and government-mandated restrictions and closures impacted consumer mobility and, in turn, our performance. We did see an improvement later in the quarter as economies began to reopen and consumers returned to more activities outside the home. We continue to feel good about our long-term strategies and the strength we saw in our core products and channels during the quarter. Despite new challenges and increased complexities, we delivered profitable category-leading sales growth in North America. These gains were offset by sales declines in areas heavily impacted by the pandemic and related government restrictions and consumer mobility limitations. Our agile investment mindset enabled us to quickly pivot and mitigate sales declines in areas impacted by consumer mobility restrictions. In addition, our advantaged margin structure and strong cost management helped us to mitigate incremental COVID-19-related costs to enable us to deliver adjusted earnings per share in line with last year. We expect accelerated sales growth in the second half of the year, based on momentum exiting the quarter, assuming there\u2019s no significant disruption to current consumer trends. We also expect pricing and strong cost management to drive margin expansion and earnings growth in the second half of the year. Now, let me share some details on our North American business. While we have seen significant channel disruption and changes in consumer behavior, our brands and categories remain an important part of consumers\u2019 lives and have performed relatively well. We saw strong performance in the food, mass, dollar and e-commerce classes of trade, consistent with broader channel trends. Our e-commerce sales growth remains significantly higher than our pre-COVID baseline, with year-over-year sales growth accelerating further in the second quarter to 200%. Category trends in drug, convenience and club channels were more pressured, though all sequentially improved as we progressed through the quarter as consumers returned to more normal activities away from home. While COVID-19 has impacted traffic to some key channels in the short-term, we continue to believe our channel diversification is a long-term strategic advantage. Despite some of these pressures, our combined retail takeaway in measured channels was up over 4% in the quarter and it was up almost 9% in June. Importantly, we are winning share in every channel this year, and our share growth is strongest in the largest channels that are experiencing the most growth. We are leading not only through our portfolio of iconic brands, consumer relevant marketing and strong execution, but with our thought leadership, as well. Within confection, this has enabled us to drive growth that far exceeds the category and expand our number one share position in the U.S. Our category share grew 225 basis points in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date share gain to 150 basis points. The chocolate category is performing well, with growth of approximately 4% in measured channels for the first half of the year, despite a shorter Easter. Everyday chocolate sales have consistently grown 9% since the pandemic began. While take-home products are driving outsized growth, instant consumable products are also growing. Hershey\u2019s has outperformed the category, with sales growth across brands that accelerated as we progressed through the quarter. In June, Hershey\u2019s chocolate portfolio grew 13%, with Reese\u2019s, Hershey\u2019s and Kit Kat brands each growing 14%. Key variety brands, such as PayDay, York, Almond Joy, Mounds, Heath and Rolo, also all grew during the month, resulting in a combined growth rate of over 11%. Our key chocolate innovation is also performing well. As we discussed in April, much of our innovation was launched prior to the pandemic hitting the U.S. Despite softening convenience store trends in the quarter, our instant consumable innovation remains on track. Our Reese\u2019s Take 5 relaunch is set to double the size of the brand this year to approximately $70 million of retail sales, and our Kit Kat flavor innovation is doing very well, with Kit Kat Duos and Kit Kat Birthday Cake both driving incremental brand household penetration and frequency. Distribution of our new THINS innovation was delayed slightly by the pandemic at several customers, but it\u2019s now in full distribution and velocities are strong. We have secured strong merchandising in-store for our key summer promotions, including Smores, Twizzlers and our Reese\u2019s Lovers In and Out Promotions. Our teams have shown great agility to adjust messaging and deliver consumer-relevant content to drive growth of 14% on these programs versus last year. Our Twizzlers and Jolly Rancher brands grew a combined 6% in the second quarter, also ahead of the category. Our strong in-store merchandising on Twizzlers has been amplified by consumer-relevant marketing to drive accelerated growth this summer as consumers enjoy this classic treat while watching movies at home or in the car on their summer road trips. As we mentioned in April, the refreshment category has been negatively impacted by social distancing, as the functional need for breath freshening has lessened. While trends have improved since April, the category continued to decline 20% to 25% in June. Our business has trended relatively in line with the category. We expect category trends to remain challenged until social distancing guidelines relax. Sales for our baking items are performing exceptionally well, with growth of over 40% in the second quarter. This growth was across products, including syrup, baking chips, toppings and cocoa, as consumers spend more time at home together in the kitchen. We have capitalized on this trend to sustain momentum, increasing marketing spend and generating more content and recipes for our consumers. This is important for the second half of the year, when baking takes on an even bigger role in U.S. households. Finally, let me touch on our better-for-you snack portfolio. Our salty snack brands have shown solid growth this year. As we shared on our call in April, we did experience some softness early in the second quarter, as our in-store presence and supply was negatively impacted by COVID-19. We worked quickly to improve our execution and in-store distribution and merchandising, resulting in accelerated performance in late May and June. In the month of June, our Skinny Pop and Pirate\u2019s Booty brands grew 8.4% and 3.7%, respectively, in measured channels, and total sales growth outpaced these levels, bolstered by strong growth in club and e-commerce. While we saw strong sales growth in measured channels, as expected, this was partially offset by significant declines in our food service and specialty retail businesses. Trends improved as we progressed through the quarter as many locations re-opened; however, traffic and sales remained below prior year levels in June. While we expect the second half headwind in these channels to be less severe than the second quarter impact, uncertainty remains as consumer behaviors continue to evolve, COVID-19 cases rise and regions consider mitigating actions to control the spread of the virus. Before I discuss our international segment, let me spend a few minutes providing an update on Halloween. As many of you know, Halloween is our largest season and it represents approximately 10% of our annual sales. We begin manufacturing product in the second quarter and primarily ship product to stores in the third quarter. Halloween celebrations are likely to be different this year, with an earlier start to the season and more geographic differences than in prior years. We expect that there will be more at-home activities, with families sharing timeless traditions and new ways for people to celebrate with neighbors. It is important to note that nearly 50% of Halloween candy spend is on \u201ctreat for me\u201d and \u201ccandy bowl\u201d occasions, which start early in the season. Trick or treating represents the other 50% of the season, with sales concentrated in the last two weeks of October. While research indicates trick-or-treating participation will likely be below prior year levels due to COVID-19 concerns, the expectation of this holiday tradition has been consistently improving over the past several weeks. We expect to outperform the category given our iconic brands, strong innovation and merchandising, and great execution. While we have visibility to orders and current consumer intentions, we expect the virus and consumer sentiment to evolve in the months leading up to the season, which could present some risk to sell-through.  We will continue to monitor consumer behavior and local guidelines and partner with our retailers to help consumers celebrate the season of Halloween during this uncertain time. Now, let me shift gears and discuss our international and other segment. As anticipated, second quarter results were significantly impacted by COVID-19. As we shared in April, our owned retail Chocolate World locations were closed during the second quarter and we saw a meaningful impact on our travel retail business as air travel declined. While our locations have begun to reopen and air travel is beginning to improve, traffic remains well below historical levels and we anticipate a slower recovery in these channels. In several of our key international markets -- notably, Mexico, India and Brazil -- we have seen a significant increase in coronavirus cases over the past several months. While measures to stem the spread of the virus have varied by country, we have consistently seen these measures and their associated economic impact pressure chocolate category sales. In many of these markets, chocolate consumption is not as embedded in the culture as it is in the United States, and it is premium priced versus other food and snacking options. Category trends did improve as the quarter progressed, but they remain below prior year levels. While we saw strength in some of our other items in key markets, such as cocoa powder, syrup and spreads, it wasn\u2019t enough to offset the chocolate declines. We have responded to these recent trends and scaled back investments accordingly to help mitigate the COVID-19 impact on our business. We remain committed to our international strategy over the long-term and we will maintain an appropriate level of investment to capture opportunities as the macroeconomic environment and pandemic improve. Now, let me turn it over to Steve to provide some more details of our financial results, as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. Steve?\nSteve Voskuil: Thanks, Michele, and good morning, everyone. Before reviewing the detailed results for the second quarter, I want to build on Michele\u2019s remarks and commend our team\u2019s ability to adapt, execute and make smart decisions quickly during this unprecedented time. While our top line was challenged due to COVID-19-related softness in certain areas of the business, and we incurred incremental costs related to the pandemic, strong price realization in North America and proactive cost management allowed us to sustain profitability and deliver earnings in line with last year. As we look to the balance of the year, we anticipate incremental improvement to our top line, and feel good about the plans we have in place to continue to adapt and manage the opportunities and challenges that may arise in this dynamic operating environment. During the second quarter, reported net sales decreased by 3.4% versus the same period a year ago, with an organic, constant currency decline of 3.5%. As Michele mentioned, these declines were driven by COVID-19-related pressures to our international and other segment, as well as non-traditional channels in the U.S., such as food service and specialty retail. These declines were partially offset by strength in our confection business in measured channels, which benefited from elevated at-home demand and strong price realization. Despite these top line challenges and incremental COVID-19-related manufacturing costs, price realization and productivity savings enabled us to maintain our peer-leading adjusted gross margin of 46.4% in the second quarter, relatively in line with prior year. Adjusted operating profit increased 4.4% in the second quarter, resulting in a 170-basis-point improvement to operating profit margin versus the prior year period. Incremental incentives, cleaning and PPE costs were more than offset by travel and meeting expense favorability, as well as marketing spend optimization to align with consumer demand changes in the quarter. In North America, organic, constant currency sales growth of 0.4% was driven by pricing and elevated at home consumption of our chocolate and baking items. This was partially offset by sales declines in foodservice, specialty retail and our refreshment brands due to COVID-19. Price realization contributed 4.2 points in the quarter, which was slightly ahead of expectations, due to incremental trade efficiencies realized from revenue management and selective programming choices related to COVID-19. We continue to expect second half price realization to be approximately 1.5 to 2 points, driven primarily by our July 2019 price increase. Food service, specialty retail and refreshment were each down approximately 40% during the second quarter. We continue to expect these businesses to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 during the balance of the year, but improve incrementally as the economy and consumer mobility continue to recover. In measured channels, retail takeaway for Hershey was 4.1% for the second quarter, driven by strength in demand for our take-home confection and baking businesses, and strong execution by our supply chain to ensure product was available and on-shelf. We did not see this fully flow through to net sales, as retailer inventory levels continued to be depleted to satisfy a portion of this demand. As a result, we expect these inventory levels to be replenished in the coming months, contributing approximately one to two points of growth in the second half the year. Adjusted gross margin for the North America segment expanded 20 basis points to 47.5% for the second quarter, driven by strong price realization, which more than offset a challenging 2019 lap of favorable mix and incremental COVID-19-related costs for incentives, cleaning and PPE. Mix was a slight headwind for the quarter, driven primarily by lapping the significant mix benefit from Q2 of 2019, versus COVID-19- driven mix shifts this year. As Michele mentioned, our instant consumable business has continued to grow, which has helped maintain our margin strength. As a result, we do not anticipate mix being a material driver of earnings in the second half. North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend decreased 10.8% in the second quarter, driven by media cost efficiencies and selective programming optimization related to COVID-19. Approximately half of our spend reduction was driven by favorable digital media costs in the marketplace, a portion of which we expect to sustain in the second half. The remaining declines were driven by reduced investment in brands negatively impacted by COVID-19 trends, including IceBreakers and select chocolate brands that are disproportionately sold in the convenience store class of trade. As consumer trends improved in May and June, we began reinvesting in these businesses. These actions are a testament to our capabilities and willingness to adapt quickly to changes in the marketplace. As we look to the balance of the year, we will continue to be mindful of the evolving operating environment, but plan to invest more in advertising and consumer marketing as sales trends improve. In our international and other segment, organic, constant currency sales declined 33.4% in the second quarter, driven by COVID-19-related softness in our owned Chocolate World retail locations, large declines in air travel and performance in key international markets. Combined constant currency net sales in Mexico, Brazil, India and China declined 31.8% versus the second quarter in 2019. As Michele mentioned, we expect our international business to be slower to recover and likely challenged for the balance of year because of both COVID-19-related restrictions and economic conditions impacting consumer participation in the chocolate category. Our owned retail businesses were closed for nearly the entire second quarter, though all have reopened on a limited basis with appropriate COVID-19-related precautions. While our stores have reopened, we do expect significantly decreased foot traffic during the second half of the year and, therefore, expect sales to remain below prior year levels. Given these declines to the top line, we have taken a disciplined look at our variable cost base and optimized where feasible, while still maintaining the appropriate level of brand investment. This resulted in savings in advertising and related consumer marketing, along with travel expenses of approximately $15 million. The segment reported a slightly negative operating income of $4 million for the second quarter. We continue to expect gradual recovery throughout the second half of the year, but do not expect the segment to return to the same level as last year. While this segment has borne the greatest impact from COVID-19, we remain committed to the right balance of investment and support to ensure acceleration post COVID-19. Shifting to items below operating profit, interest expense was $38 million for the second quarter, an increase of $4.3 million, versus the same period a year ago, due to higher debt balances from debt issuances in October 2019. Other expense of $11.2 million represented a decline of $1.9 million, due to the purchase of fewer tax credits and lower non-service-related pension expense. The adjusted tax rate in the second quarter increased by 4.6% to 19.4%. This increase was due to the lapping of a prior period benefit related to the release of valuation allowances in select international markets. At this time, we do not anticipate any material changes to the tax and other income/expense outlook that we shared with you in January.We do, however, expect interest expense to marginally increase over the prior year due to the bond issuance in October 2019 and May 2020. Despite any short-term challenges posed by COVID-19, we remain confident in our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet to manage through the current crisis and beyond. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet, an increase of $800 million versus last year, and $614 million in operating cash flow. To further mitigate potential risk and to take advantage of favorable rates in the capital markets, we issued $1 billion of bonds in the second quarter with staggered maturities, while paying long-term debt of $350 million that came due in May. We continue to have a peer-leading capital structure, providing agility to adapt to the dynamic environment we are operating in. Given our strong free cash flow and liquidity, we remain committed to our long-term capital priorities, with a balanced approach to investing in the business and returning cash to our stockholders, all while managing through this volatile environment. First, let\u2019s discuss our commitment to reinvestment. In the second quarter, total capital additions, including software, were approximately $87 million, bringing our-year-to date investment to $186 million. As discussed in April, our revised capital spending full year outlook of $400 million to $450 million reflects selectively pausing portions of our ERP transformation and supply chain capacity and capability initiative. Both ERP and our supply chain initiative, while re-phased, remain on track and are critical capabilities to deliver our long-term strategic initiatives. Now, shifting to returning cash to our stockholders, which remains a steadfast priority in our capital allocation strategy, earlier this morning, we announced our third quarter dividend, reflecting a 4% increase. While the Company did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter against the July 2018 $500 million authorization, we did repurchase $42 million of common stock in connection with replenishment of stock options. We remain confident that our balanced approach to business investment and returning cash to stockholders will continue to provide sustained stockholder returns now and in the future. As you saw in the press release, we are not providing new 2020 fiscal guidance at this time. While the Company\u2019s performance improved over the course of the second quarter, the impact of recent spikes in coronavirus cases on consumer mobility, retail operations, governmental regulations and the macroeconomic environment remains unclear. With that being said, we do want to provide some visibility into our latest thinking for the balance of the year, which is based on our current understanding of the operating environment. In the North America segment, the Company expects accelerated sales growth in the second half of the year driven by elevated at-home consumption, price realization and the replenishment of retailer and distributor inventory levels. These gains are anticipated to offset improving, but still pressured, sales in the food service and specialty retail channels. The Company does not currently expect seasonal performance to have a material impact on second half financial results, though the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases on consumer participation in seasonal activities remains uncertain. In the international and other segment, the Company expects demand to slowly rebound in the second half of the year, but remain below prior year levels as owned stores, travel retail and developing markets recover more slowly. Finally, as it relates to sales, during the second quarter, we completed the planned divestitures of our Krave, Dagoba and Scharffenberger brands. These divestitures are expected to have a relatively small 20-basis-point impact to sales in the second half and an immaterial impact to earnings per share. Solid price realization and strong cost management are anticipated to offset some of the incremental COVID-19 costs we are facing. COVID-19 costs are expected to be less in the second half of the year, mainly for increased plant sanitation and personal protective equipment for Manufacturing and Sales Teams. We anticipate that price realization will continue to drive gross margin gains, though to a lesser extent than the first half of the year, as we begin to lap the announcement of the 2019 price increase. Selling, general and administrative expenses should continue to show favorability in the back half of the year, behind lower travel and meeting expenses and favorable incentive compensation versus prior year. Finally, as it relates to brand investment, we intend to continue investing in North America and further optimize spend in the international and other segment in accordance with expected sales trends. While we have not issued new guidance today, we hope this additional perspective is helpful to understand our approach to managing through the crisis and our high level expectations for the next several months pending the continued evolution of the pandemic. We remain confident in our team, our plan and our agile operating model to deliver solid shareholder returns this year and in the future. Now, I will turn it back to Michele.\nMichele Buck : Thanks, Steve. During a time of extraordinary changes and challenges this quarter, our teams responded with agility and executed well against factors within our control. We have balanced delivering today with making calculated investments that we believe will enable us to emerge even stronger after the pandemic. In times of risk and crisis, cultures are either strengthened or weakened. Hershey has come together and thrived as a team, committed to serving our consumers and our communities. Our purpose and commitment to operating sustainably and responsibly continues to move us forward. Last month, we released our 2019 sustainability report that highlights some of the great progress we have made in this space, as well as some of our key priorities for the future. I encourage you to go to our website and take a look. In addition to the sustainability report, you will also find information on some of our more recent actions and pledges. Let me take a minute to discuss two that are top of mind related to recent events. We have long supported our communities and given the unprecedented need many are facing right now, we have amplified these efforts. In addition to increasing our product and monetary donations, we have invested in our own mask production line to service our employees, their families and our communities. Second, for many years, we have pursued a vision of building a more diverse and inclusive company. We have been recognized for our progress, including being named the top food company for diversity by Diversity Inc. Recently, we initiated a company-wide dialogue to listen, learn and grow together. Through that dialogue, we have seen the very best of our Hershey culture, and a genuine desire to do more in the fight against systemic racism. We announced a set of initiatives to support Black and Brown communities and accelerate increasing Black and Brown representation and internal development at Hershey and amongst our key partners to promote social and economic progress. We believe these initiatives will help address the need for meaningful, long-term change in our society, and include evolving our approach to recruiting, talent development, training and reporting, as well as pledging monetary donations to organizations to actively fight systematic racism. To close, we believe Hershey is well positioned to adapt and succeed over the long term. We have scale brands in growing categories that consumers love and trust, we have a highly efficient, yet agile, supply chain that we are investing in for the future, we have advantaged capabilities in analytics, media, category management and sales, that we believe position us well to drive profitable growth in the future, and we have a team that is dedicated to our purpose of making more moments of goodness. We remain confident and committed to our long-term strategies and financial targets. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks this morning. Thank you for your time this morning. I invite you to listen to our live question-and-answer webcast, which will begin today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, and will be available at thehersheycompany.com. Thank you.\nOperator: Greetings, and welcome to The Hershey Company Second Quarter 2020 Q&A Session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin.\nMelissa Poole: Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's second quarter 2020 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and look into our pre-recorded management presentation both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted the transcript of the pre-recorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session we will also post the transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q&A session we may make forward looking statements that are subject to various risk and uncertainties. These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance, including expectations and assumptions related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Actual results could differ materially from those projected as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as other factors. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release on the company's SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information does not intend to be considered in isolation, or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nMichele Buck: Hi Chris.\nOperator: Mr. Growe your line is live. Perhaps you are muted.\nChris Growe: I was muted there. I am so sorry. Thank you. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nChris Growe: Good morning. I hope you're all well. I just wanted to a question if I could, first of all, on -- as we're looking ahead to the second half of the year, you did call the seasons to be less of a -- not a material effect on the performance of the business over that time. I'm curious, and you did have some discussion on your call this morning about Halloween overall. Can you tell based on orders how Halloween is shaping up at this point in time and the degree to which they have could have an effect on Q3 sales? Then, you also talked last quarter about having some early seasonal sort of fall product coming out, how is that -- is that in the market already or going into the market sooner? How could that play into your overall seasonal sales in Q3?\nMelissa Poole: Sure. So for Halloween, we do have orders from retailers. We start to get those orders way back in May. In fact, we try and finalize the orders that by the end of May and we have already shipped some product. The way the season unrolls, we continue to ship product from really June through early October. So we have pretty good visibility to those orders. Now, it's always possible that orders could change in the coming months, but that is not a very common occurrence. I'd also remind you as we listed in our comments about half of our products for Halloween is purchase for self-consumption. So that's really candy ball. It's a celebratory kind of treat for the family and then, that about 40% of it then falls into the back part of October, which are the trick-or-treat sales. So we feel good based on what we've seen. We've been partnering closely with our retailers. We feel good about many retailers wanting to kind of lean in. We also think that consumers will find creative and safe ways to trick-or-treat. It is an outdoor event, and it's an event where a lot of masks are already worn. There is no evidence of the virus being passed through packaging or food. So we feel pretty good based on what we're seeing so far from a consumer feedback, but if trick-or-treat tends to be a little lower than expectation, clearly, we will focus even more on to treat for me and the candy ball occasion. So you already know that we shifted some of our portfolio to more everyday packaging to protect the downside should Halloween sales be a little bit later to really manage that liability. So at this point in time, based on what we're seeing, we feel pretty good. From a holiday perspective, we do have an early read on the holiday. We have started producing product. At this time, we don't really see seasonal participation being significantly impacted, and a lot of that is due to the fact that many holiday occasions and consumption is actually at home. So we think that will be less likely to be disrupted, but obviously, we will continue to monitor that closely -- to work closely with our retailers as we have with Halloween.\nChris Growe: That's great. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up if I could, which is in relation to retailer inventory levels. As you ended the quarter, I just want to get a sense of where they were. Obviously, you did under-ship demand in the quarter. There is an expectation for an increase at the second half of the year. And I just want to kind of tie into that seasonal discussion. Is that a component of the expectation for higher inventories in the second half of the year? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yes. So inventory was about 1.5 point to 2 point headwind on our first half growth, and there were really a couple of factors that drove that. Part of it is, as you recall last year, we had a build of inventory as retailers were perhaps anticipating a price increase. So the lap from that creates part of that. Secondly, we were depleting inventory as a result of consumer stock-ups and the acceleration that we saw in takeaway across our portfolio. So we've been working really hard and had very strong customer service levels versus the industry. But yet, we've still been continuing to replenish to kind of catch up with that accelerated demand. And then, the third factor that really falls into that equation is non-measured channel softness. We've talked to you about owned retail locations, world travel retail, the foodservice, some of those businesses that don't show up in measured happen to be the same ones where we have some of the greatest softness. So the -- so the Halloween piece is not really a factor in that inventory piece. It is much more around the everyday businesses on the non-measured channel.\nChris Growe: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from lion of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. \nJason English: Hey good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nJason English: Good morning. Congratulations to you and your organization for navigating everything so smoothly right now. But looking at the forward, I'm kind of curious of the pricing outlook. You guys mentioned that you expect pricing in North America to moderate to 1.5% to 2%, which I believe is pretty much singularly the effect of last year's price increases. Said differently, it's suggested you're not expecting some of this trade efficiency and benefits of lower promotions to sustain. If so, why not? Because it looks like the promotional environment for both you and your competitors remains pretty subdued in July, why would it come back so quickly?\nMichele Buck: So first of all, as we look at the promotional pricing that you see as you look at some of the retail scanner data, we do not believe that data is correct. There is a lot less auditing going on during this time than previously. So the biggest issue we think there is we think simply the data is just not correct. We are continuing to see the kind of promotional activity that we had planned in the second quarter behind Smores, Twizzlers, our Reese's In and Out lever promotion. And going forward, we feel good about the promotional plans that we have in the back half of the year with our retail partners.\nSteve Voskuil: So yes, I -- here we're going to -- we look at revenue management all the time. And so, driving trade efficiency is part of the base plan, but as Michele said, the outsized impact that we saw in the second quarter was really more data issue. We were out in stores, Smores were out; Twizzlers were out, so we had quite a bit of promotion.\nJason English: Interesting, I heard that. Thank you. That's good context. Sticking on the same theme of pricing book flashing forward, as you mentioned, you're on the brink of cycling last year's price increases. Pricing has been part of your growth algorithm in North America for the last couple of years. I don't think you've announced anything new and you are about to cycle these. As we think beyond this year, should we expect pricing to exit part of the -- you don't want to be part of the algorithm for the foreseeable future? And if not, why not?\nMichele Buck: No. I mean, we remain committed to the pricing strategy that we've discussed with all of you before, and that's really behind smaller more frequent price increases. While we have price each of the last two years, that certainly doesn't mean within our strategy that we have plans to price every single year. We really take a strategic approach where we look at opportunities across the portfolio. Right now, all of our pricing initiatives remain on track, and we continue to think that we're going to see price realization in the second half. But as you know, we have several different levers that we rely on to drive the business. Pricing is one of those, but brand investment, key retailer initiatives, innovation, merchandising and new capabilities, that balanced portfolio levers to drive growth is something we really believe in, and we think that that's very important. So we take a lot of variables into consideration when we decide, what to price, when to price, how to price, and we will be consistent with the stated strategy going forward.\nJason English: Understood. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question. \nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks for the question. I guess, two smaller ones. A follow-up to Jason's, my understanding is over the past couple of years, you had taken pricing on about two-thirds of the portfolio, which left another third. It's likely to be raised as well. I mean, has something changed since the start of the year with how you're looking at your list price increased plan? I guess, that's the key thing, has something changed? And then just a quick follow-up on Mexico, I was surprised to see Mexico down so much. Is -- do you put that in the category of countries where chocolate is just not part of the overall embedded culture of the country, because I thought Mexico had been pretty resilient in the past? Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Yes. So relative to pricing, our plans were not impacted or changed for the year. It is correct that we have a third in portfolio that wasn't priced in those actions, but we did not change our plans throughout the year on pricing. So we just continue to look across and decide when and what and Halloween was the right time. Relative to Mexico, we certainly have seen big disruptions in that market. And I would say -- I wouldn't put it as much certainly -- there are certainly pockets of Mexico where there are economic issues, but the biggest factor in Mexico has really been the trade, the spread of the virus and then the shutdown of key elements of the trade specifically, the wholesaler network, distributor network where we have about 50% of our business. And so, it was really the trade shutdown that impacted our business in Mexico.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Can I sneak one more in? Your outlook is very robust for third quarter and -- based on the strong exit rate and the visibility at Halloween. Is your assumption that the other 40% like the element that's based on sell-through, is your assumption that, that part will be down year-over-year? Have you been appropriately conservative on that element in your outlook?\nMichele Buck: I think that we have been appropriately conservative. I think we have partnered with our retailers. So we've utilized that visibility. We've taken into account what we think the category will be. And importantly, we've also taken into account what we believe our market share of the category will be based on recent performance and what's happening in the marketplace right now. So I think if we see pressures in Halloween, that's probably going to show up more toward Q4 than Q3 as it will be at that -- those end periods post the holiday relative to sell-through at that point in time.\nRobert Moskow: Got it. Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. \nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thank you very much. Even -- in 2Q, even with the weaker volume and elevated COVID costs that you incurred, the company was still able to expand operating margin by 170 basis points or so. So just as we think through the second half, some of those, I guess, COVID discrete costs begin to dissipate, volume starts to pick up based on some of the comments you made about exit rate and things of that nature. So perhaps investment spending, I guess, picks up as well. So I guess, as we think about margins in the second half, what would be maybe the key points to consider versus let's say, where Hershey came out in 2Q? In other words, where do you expect margins to be up similarly to what you saw in 2Q or what are some of the discrete factors that could change that one way or the other? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Steve you want to hit that one?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. I'd be happy to take that. You're quite right. Q2 turned out to be more favorable from a margin standpoint than we expected going in. While we had incentives, some of those incentives were less than what we had expected for the quarter. Insurance costs that we had expected for the second quarter came out more favorably. We talked on the last call about productivity, and productivity being a risk for the quarter and in fact, the productivity goals in manufacturing were still achieved. Probably, the lingering piece, PPE and cleaning costs, that will continue. So we kind of take Q2 and look to the future, obviously the incentives based on everything we know today are about returning. Productivity, we expect to continue along with our full-year plan. PP&E is not a big cost in the quarter, so I think $3 million, $4 million a quarter as a benchmark. We will continue to drive SG&A savings both at the corporate level with travel and meetings, as well as at the division level. And then, as you said, we're going to spend a little bit more back from a DME standpoint. So while we had an opportunity in Q2 to optimize, probably optimize a little bit more than we had expected. We are going to invest back more behind the brands as we get to the back half of the year, so -- and a little bit less pricing benefit as well. We've had a lot of pricing benefit across the first half. As we lap now, that will also start to come off. So those are the big drivers. That's the reason, again not giving specific guidance, but expecting some margin acceleration in the back half.\nAndrew Lazar: Very helpful there. And then, just one last one, Michele. The market share gains that Hershey has been seeing, right, have been pretty phenomenal and unprecedented in many ways and certainly, a big part of that has been the company's execution, right, particularly at the point of sale and in-store and leveraging the advantaged distribution model that you have. I know there has been some issues that competitors, let's say, around -- let's say, supply chain resiliency and things like that. So I'm just trying to get a sense, as you think through how market share can sometimes be pretty sticky, both when it's gained and when it's lost, how do you think about the share that Hershey has picked up? I would assume that at some point, as things normalize and competitors get back there, whatever supply chain resiliency, there'll be some additional pressure on that front, but I'm trying to get sense of how much do you think of share can kind of structurally remain or be sticky versus let's say, some that might be more transitory, if you get what I'm asking?\nMichele Buck: Yes. Absolutely. I guess, I'd start by saying, even pre-COVID, we had very good momentum in both takeaway and market share starting last year. And we really attribute that to the balanced activation plan and great execution that we had even then, which was a good -- I think the right balance across advertising, distribution, pricing, seasons and innovation, kinds of that suite of levers that we have. Obviously, since COVID, as you mentioned, our team has really stepped up relative to execution keeping product on shelf, while there were some struggles among some other competitors in the marketplace. And certainly, we do know some competitors also begin to rationalize SKUs to simplify their portfolios. So we do believe that the recent share performance is likely to persist for several more months. And while we do think that huge game that we're seeing is likely to revert next year as we lap the strengths, we do believe that some of the gains will remain in the long term and sustain.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ken Goldman of JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. \nKen Goldman: Hi, thank you. I also wanted to follow up on Jason English's question really just to make sure I understood your response, because you did say in the prepared remarks, price realization contributed 4.2 points in the quarter, slightly ahead of expectations due to incremental trade efficiencies realized from revenue management and selective programming choices related to COVID-19. So sorry for reading all of that, but I did interpret this quote, especially the part about selective programming choices to mean that you did reduce your reliance on discounting in the second quarter. So I guess, given that you're not changing your guidance for the back half of the year, doesn't that imply that you're going from a period of less discounting to a period of sort of more normal discounting, or what am I missing there? I'm just still not sure I understand exactly sure what that quote means maybe.\nMichele Buck: So we did pull back a little bit in the second quarter and that was primarily around refreshment given what was going on with refreshment being so incredibly soft and the functional demand just not being there as much for that product, especially given its presence in convenience stores and also a bit on grocery just because that part of the business was doing so incredibly well on its own. A little bit on Smores, we had really strong demand on Smores, but what I would say is, the trends are now stabilizing as the most severe declines on certain parts or most severe accelerations on parts of the portfolio in Q2. We saw the wildest swings and those tend to be stabilizing a bit now. So we are kind of going back to a more normalizing approach. It wasn't a huge pullback in Q2. It was very selective against those parts of the portfolio. Does that help?\nKen Goldman: Yes, I know that is -- that's clear. Thank you. And then, for my follow-up, some of your peers in the broader sort of food and beverage industry have talked about making some pretty meaningful reductions to their product portfolios in terms of SKUs. We haven't heard quite as much from Hershey on that. I'm just trying to, or I'm hoping to get an update from you in terms of how you think the breadth of your portfolio is right now in a post-COVID world and whether there are any plans, I guess, sort of major reductions or miners to some of the products that you might have.\nMichele Buck: Yes. So we had already really embarked upon SKU rationalization program really over the past two, 2.5 years. So we had pretty aggressively taken a look across our portfolio and made a lot of those cuts. So at this point in time, we're feeling pretty good about where we are. I don't see a major program. Obviously, it's always an ongoing focus to optimize and to cut some of the small things, but the biggest steps we had already taken previously.\nSteve Voskuil: And meanwhile, some of the new innovations that we brought to market that you have done quite well. So where we brought in new SKUs, whether it was Kit Kat Birthday or Take 5.\nKen Goldman: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. \nNik Modi: Yes. Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So just kind of two-parter on innovation. It's nice to see retailers picking on new products. We've been seeing that trend now. Obviously, people were a little doubtful of how much new product would actually get into retail, given the focus on A level SKUs, but Michele, I was wondering if you can just opine on. Has there been a philosophical difference at retail that you can discern in terms of what products they are actually taking on the shelf? And I'm really kind of get out our large companies like Hershey advantage from the situation in terms of new product given well-known brands, etc. And then on the second piece of that, just some of the work we've done looking at numerator data would suggest there's a heavy degree of interaction between the Hershey portfolio and the snack cake category. And I know you've dabbled in that area to some degree with Mrs. Freshley's, but can you just give us some thoughts on how you're thinking about that adjacency kind of opportunity a little bit more broadly?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So starting with your first question, we definitely have seen retailers, especially during the COVID situation, dial up their focus on power SKUs, must-have SKUs, really because of the huge consumer demand and needing to make sure that they were in stock on the most important items and also just because of labor needs and all of that just a focus on what's really going to deliver the business. I think that's what -- why you're seeing. Many of the manufacturers also now started to really rethink their portfolios to do the same. So I would say, yes, I think the retail trade is saying, hey, right now, this is a time where we need to focus on those biggest most important items. So I think you're right about that. And then, I'm sorry, remind me again, your second question?\nNik Modi: Yes. No problem. Snack cake category.\nMichele Buck: Snack cake. Yes. So we have seen some similarity, some crossover in terms of candy and snack cake consumption. They both have some similar traits in terms of really hitting the kind of the treat sweet tooth and filling certain needs for consumers that are similar. So I think we have seen some of that crossover certainly from consumers.\nNik Modi: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning everyone. Just two quick ones for me. One, you gave some color in the press release about performance in June. So, just curious if July has continued to progress the same way. And then, the second question is more around distribution gains. I think you referenced in response to Andrew's question, the -- some of the issues that some of your competitors have had. So I guess, if they're reducing SKUs and maybe having trouble keeping some things in stock, have you actually gained shelf space or gained distribution in this time period? And if so, kind of, if you could give some color in terms of which channels, is it more convenience and gas, more in grocery? Just some more color there would be helpful. Thanks.\nMichele Buck: So we haven't really seen any material changes in July versus our trends. So there are some geographic differences, just given the big differential across geographies as a result of COVID. So now, I would say we're feeling good about what we continue to see. And market share is pretty consistent though. In terms of our market share performance, I would say we're feeling pretty good in terms of continuation of that trend.\nBryan Spillane: And I think wherever we've had opportunity to take advantage of getting shelf space or a broader distribution it's crossed over all classes of trade. \nMichele Buck: Yes. And we certainly -- those are some of the benefits that I think you don't always see immediately because you have planogram timing, etc., to realize those benefits. So some of those benefits, I think, we started to see in June and that might be what's driving some of our continued trends -- positive trends in July.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. So you have seen some shelf space gains or some distribution gains.\nMichele Buck: Yes.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of David Driscoll with DD Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Driscoll: Great. Thank you and good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nDavid Driscoll: Great. Good morning. I wanted to ask about a little bit on the seasonal candy and then, a specific question on Halloween with the related. So I know for the full year, roughly a third of the portfolio was seasonal candy. But in just the second half of the year, can you give us the breakdown between your seasonal sales in your everyday sales? What percent of the second half is actual seasonal?\nMichele Buck: Well, Halloween, we've said previously, is about 10% of our full-year business. Certainly, seasons are higher in the second half than they are in the first half because Valentine's is our smallest holiday. So you really have Easter as a big one in the first half. We don't really want to get into some of the specifics by quarter. But I would say that the season's impact is definitely bigger in the second half than the first half.\nDavid Driscoll: And then, I -- just to be clear, I think what you're saying is -- I think you said this in the release that you don't expect Halloween to have a material impact, so it sounds like it's flat. And if seasons are 40% or something like that of the second half and the seasonal numbers are expected to be roughly flattish and your everyday is running up 9%, I think that's what you also said in the release. And is that not a decent way to think about how to model North America in the second half?\nMichele Buck: I think your math is generally correct. I can't argue with the math. The one thing I would say is you're speaking specifically to measured channels, and you need to remember the impact of non-measured channels, owned retail, foodservice, air travel, world travel retail, which is airline and the trends on those businesses as that does -- that has been as we've shared the biggest hit in our business. So while those channels are certainly not shut down like they were in Q2, they're in the recovery mode. And the recovery mode is definitely going to be a slow uptick.\nDavid Driscoll: Okay. So that -- there is a little adjustment to maybe the everyday 9% that I quoted because of those unmeasured channels and then, seasonal is where the expectation is roughly flattish given what you know today. Obviously, there's plenty of caveats and what could change. So I think I'm understanding you. My follow-up question is just on your marketing and your overall expenses. So a tremendous job. I'll give you guys huge kudos on what you did in the second quarter to get your margins where they came out. I'm just curious that is there a learning here that you can actually run a significantly tighter expense budget on a go-forward basis? I'm guessing that the COVID made you do certain things that you normally wouldn't have done, and the results here are, market share gains are fantastic. When you think a year forward, two years forward, can some of these cost reductions be very sticky because it's proving that you didn't need to spend some of those monies in order to produce, I think, excellent results at retail?\nMichele Buck: I mean, I think SG&A is clearly an area that we're expecting that how much we need to spend will change permanently over time. So I think that piece, yes. I think on the marketing expenses, it's a little bit different. Certainly, some of our pullbacks were as a result of certain businesses like refreshment that were down 40%. We just didn't think it made sense to be spending into that. Then, part of what we were able to do was to leverage the fact that a lot of advertisers dropped out of the marketplace and as a result, the costs of media were less than we had planned them to be. And so, we were able to have a nice outcome there. As advertisers come back into the marketplace, some of that pricing benefit is not going to be available anymore. So while there may be some ongoing efficiencies and we are always looking to tighten our data knowledge and have capabilities around media since we are big spenders to get more for our money, and we're always building capability to take it to the next level. There were some unique circumstances there as well.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, I agree. Certainly on the pricing for some of the media exposure that came down, that was a big benefit. I think we did benefit from tools and investments we made around marketing efficiencies and driving ROI and optimizing. We haven't talked as much about some of those tools, tools both on trade efficiency, but also marketing spend efficiency. And those tools allowed us also to be more agile as things evolved quickly. And so, that part is something we'll look to leverage further in the future.\nDavid Driscoll: I really appreciate it. Those are helpful comments. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. I just want to follow up on that Halloween comment. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that the seasonal performance would not have a material impact to second half results. That's an interesting comment. I mean, we're not doing the official guidance here. If you would think that, that would be a big variable, it might be 20% of your second half revenue. So is there something that's giving you confidence there? I know that you wouldn't be making such a comment without perhaps orders in hand or some insights around the ability for you to some of that through, even if it doesn't happen to trick-or-treaters, and I have a follow-up.\nMichele Buck: Yes. I mean, I think the confidence drivers are orders in hand. Some of the dynamics that exist around the fact that only half of that Halloween volume is trick-or-treat. The fact that the trick-or-treat behavior is outdoor. People do wear masks. So as we get closer, we're feeling good about that. Now obviously -- certainly, we didn't provide official guidance in the back half of the year. And there is uncertainty and volatility overall given the virus, but based on everything that we know and the visibility we have and with every day we get closer, we feel that we've taken an appropriate look at what we think can happen and have really factored that into our outlook as best possible. We've mitigated some of the downside risks with the everyday portfolio versus all the Halloween packaging. Steve, anything you would like --\nSteve Voskuil: No. I agree. I think for the things we can see and certainly, the things we can control, we're optimistic, but part of the reason for not providing more specific guidance is, there are things we can't control and probably can't see. And for those reasons, there still is potential variability in the back half, but everything we can see gives us a plenty of confidence.\nDavid Palmer: That's helpful. And with regard to COVID-related costs, you mentioned those were a gross margin headwind in the second quarter. Could you give some color as to how much that might have been? And how much of a gross margin headwind do you think it's going to be for the year? Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil: In terms of just COVID related costs?\nDavid Palmer: Yes. Just COVID related costs. Yes.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, probably on the order of \u2013 for the gross margin somewhere between $15 million and $20 million of COVID-related costs. Again, we had predicted it might be more than that. In fact, it came out less. As we go forward in the rest of the year, the biggest piece that will stick around is going to be that personal protective equipment, cleaning costs and so, if I take that $15 million to $20 million, think about maybe a third or a quarter becomes sticky to the back half.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. I had a question on c-store traffic momentum there. We've obviously seen convenience store channel improve throughout the quarter overall. It seems like hopefully that momentum is sustainable as long as people are leaving their homes more and going to the channel, but also the channel is more relevant for using a lot of other companies in this space and usually. I would think there is a little bit more of a margin benefit just given the single-serve product that you're sold there that you saw there, but with remarks, you said that margin mix really didn't have much of a headwind. It doesn't sound like you're really speaking to that as a risk going forward, which is great. I'm just kind of curious where I'd be wrong and thinking that some of that single-serve product that usually have a better price per pound and potentially better margin impact, and why it didn't and why it might not?\nMichele Buck: Yes. I mean, I think that's generally correct. We are seeing a rebound in convenience stores as people are out and about more. And I think also as some people are choosing not to travel via air, but do vacations that are more driving vacation, so I think that's helping as well. So yes, I think certainly instant consumable and that class of trade are helping the business. We're also seeing instant consumable strong and strength in other classes of trade as people have returned more now to grocery stores and trips and shopping. So the strength is not just in convenience stores. So that is helping our margin mix.\nRob Dickerson: So, it sounds like even though -- if I think about a movie theater, right, even though consumers might not be going to movie theaters and buying Hershey products there in a single-serve format as well as traffic of C-stores that maybe like you're seeing in grocery stores a bit, that is still trying to get their fix, right? So they might not be buying the big bag, but they're going to check out. It sounds like what you're saying is maybe some of your checkout momentum in traditional mass in grocery is doing better than maybe it had. I know if we go back to couple of years that at one point in time, that was a focus of yours. Is that fair?\nMichele Buck: Yes. That is fair. It has definitely -- we're seeing growth on the instant consumable piece of the business and again, I think a lot of that due to more traffic in those channels.\nRob Dickerson: Right. And it just lastly just to keep it simple and summarize because you did say instant consumer is growing right. So --\nMichele Buck: Yes.\nRob Dickerson: Because there is -- it has to be doing very well. It has to be doing very well for traditional mass in grocery at checkout, and that's more offsetting the pressure away from home in other channels.\nMichele Buck: Yes.\nRob Dickerson: Got it. Thank you. I pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please receive your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Hi, there. So two questions for me. Could you maybe just talk a little bit about what's going on in the e-commerce channels? Other companies have talked about real surges are both in terms of click-and-collect and in at-home delivery. I'm wondering whether maybe the meltability of chocolate in this hot season means that the delivery option isn't quite available to you. I'm just curious about what's going on there. And then, my second question is more about your marketing mix strategy in the second half. We know that in the TV channels, the production isn't going to be as -- there's not going to be as much in new production in the fall and therefore, the effectiveness of marketing on TV may drop off. But also, I know that you've announced that you're pulling back on your Facebook spending in the second half as well. So I'm just wondering where that spend is going to go. Is it going to be into other digital channels or how are you thinking about the mix? Thank you, and I'll pass it on.\nMichele Buck: Yes. So, we have continued to see our category and our business perform really well in e-commerce and seen that growth accelerate. So in the second quarter, we saw a growth of 200% on our e-commerce business, and that was really driven by strengths, both in the click-and-collect kind of pickup and in delivery fulfillment models. So, we saw growth across the board there. You're right that we tend to have a little bit of a softer business during the hottest months in the summer, but we're continuing to see that pretty strong growth even throughout June. So I think just the trends are bolstering that. And that growth, importantly, we're seeing across every piece of the business is a seasoned take-home and instant consumables. So in the past, we've spoken about e-commerce being roughly 2% of our business, and we believe that this channel by end of year could approximate about 5% of our total company sales, so definitely seeing a lot of strength there. When it comes to marketing mix, certainly, we're seeing efficiencies that we're going to realize in the back half in that TV class of trade. So it continues to be a really viable for a place for us to put money, given the very high household penetration on our business, and the sheer number of eyeballs that you can reach on TV is very efficient. And as we look to digital and the pullback on Facebook, we see taking those funds that were in Facebook and redirecting them still back into other digital media venues. So that -- those dollars will stay in digital, but just on other platforms like YouTube, for example.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Very helpful. I will pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will be Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Powers: Great. Thanks, everybody. I guess, first internationally, I appreciate the category itself was under pressure in many of your key markets as you called out, but can you talk a bit about your market share trends in those markets and maybe a little color as to how you're thinking about relative prioritization of investments in those markets as hopefully they begin to improve in the months and quarters ahead? I guess, what I'm thinking through is should we expect to exit the crisis with similar levels of strategic emphasis and standing in those emerging markets versus the run rate going in, or is there a risk that you slip a bit behind as navigating the U.S. landscape takes precedent.\nMichele Buck: Yes. So we are gaining market share across most of our international markets. So we feel great about that. The weakness that we're seeing is really driven either by the COVID-related shutdowns in most of the markets, government-restricted shutdowns and especially in a lot of those developing markets. And in some markets, the economic impact of that, that impacts the category, but we feel great that we're winning share across most of those markets. So I don't think that we will slip relative to our strategic emphasis. We are still committed to what we want to get achieved in those markets. We still believe in the long-term potential on those markets. So we are pulling back on a temporary basis just consistent with where the business is, but continuing our focus on all of our key initiatives to win long term in those markets.\nSteve Powers: Okay. That's helpful. And then, I guess if I could just to clean up back on the forward pricing outlook, your core category is exceptionally rational in recent years. So, I guess just given your share gain success and I guess, also just the economic pressures that might build in the back half and into '21, how do you size up the tail risk that some of that price rationality might come under challenge or at least make incremental pricing tougher to come by and at least the near term? I guess, harking back to Jason English's question earlier.\nMichele Buck: We consider a lot of factors as we're trying to decide how to think about how and when to price. So as it comes to recessionary times, over the past, we've seen that our category tends to have less of the highs and lows that some other categories have, because we are an affordable luxury, so at times, when people need to cut back on other categories. So I -- we will continue to just evaluate all the different factors for when, how, on what we will take pricing. But we aren't particularly concerned that we can't price in recessionary times. We have done that at the point in the past.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Michele, just in light of your general sense of optimism for Halloween, I guess, sticking with the brand investment plans, it sounds as though, there will be some shift of March Madness and Olympic spending into H2, but could you also talk a little bit about the in-store-merchandising activity? Are you expecting an uptick in retailer support for the season this year and I guess, increased display space for your portfolio broadly?\nMichele Buck: Yes. I mean, we are expecting based on our partnerships with retailers, very strong in-store support for Halloween with most of our retailers. We partner with every retailer, and each retailer has their own strategy in terms of how much they support the holiday. And so, I think in general, most of them are continuing to lean in to anticipate and drive to a very strong Halloween. And we believe that given our ability to execute during this time and some of the -- you've seen the results of that on the share in the marketplace, we certainly think that even our performance within the category for Halloween should be quite strong.\nJohn Baumgartner: Okay. And then, just coming back to international and the sales weakness there, I would guess a presumed review of the cost structure. Given the success you had in right-sizing China, which was sort of a unique animal in its own right, to what extent is COVID stress sort of identifying new opportunities in other geographies where you can use this downturn to maybe further strengthen your global cost structure more sustainably?\nMichele Buck: Steve, you want to talk about that?\nSteve Voskuil: Our international team does a great job of looking to optimize their P&L and cost structure on an ongoing basis. And certainly, the new opportunity here is that business, I think, curtailed in some markets, has shown even further potential there, but I think to Michele's earlier point, the strategic priority of international hasn't changed. And so, we want to continue to appropriately invest behind those businesses to unlock the long-term growth that we believe is there. But to your point, certainly, we will never waste the crisis in terms of looking at every possible way to be efficient with P&L.\nJohn Baumgartner: Great. Thanks for your time.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Good morning. Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Good morning. \nMichael Lavery: Can you just talk about corporate costs a little bit? It looks like it's the lowest they've been at least about seven years, certainly declined sequentially. You called out the travel and meetings' savings. How much of that should we expect to continue as there are other savings there that might revert back in the second half we should watch out for? How do we think about looking ahead on how that line might unfold?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. The progress that we made in the second quarter, we said from the travel and meetings standpoint was actually better than we expected going into the quarter. And given everything we see today, business has not returned to whatever normal was. And so, we expect in the back half, we're going to see those savings continue. As I think about the second quarter, we saw probably $20 million, $15 million to $20 million of opportunity across all of those areas. And I would expect to see something like that, maybe a little bit less, but something like that in the back half as well. And beyond that, that was really the biggest driver from a corporate cost standpoint.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great, thanks. And just following up on Halloween again, can you give us a sense of what some of your options may be? I know you recognized, there is a little bit of uncertainty still on how the consumer sell-through goes. If that disappoints, do you just have to battle back? Can you buy some down? Does it depend on the magnitude of inventory that may be left? Can you just let us know what the options are, and how you might be preparing for any of those?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So the first thing we're doing is trying to make sure that we ensure sell-through, which is something we always do, which is having the right merchandising, getting product on the floor as early as possible and leveraging media investment to remind consumers, excite consumers about the holiday. Then post-sell-through, there is always a markdown period that occurs based on how much product actually sells through, both in total as well as you have to get the mix right across each piece of the portfolio. And so, every year as we build our plans, we plan for that, and this year is no different. We planned for that. So we tried to mitigate our risk by -- as we look at the trick-or-treat portion of the portfolio pulling back on seasonal packaging, having more every day, so that's one -- another lever we used and then, really working through the markdown plan.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question this morning comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Zaslow: Hey good morning everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nKen Zaslow: I just have two questions. One is have you at all has changed your innovation plans for -- I don't mean for the next two months or three months, but for the longer term? There's been a lot of companies have said look, our 150th new innovation, we're not going to do any more. So, has there been a refinement of the innovation program for the next, call it, one to two years?\nMichele Buck: So I would say we already did that. A few years back, we took a look at our innovation strategy and really streamlined and focused on sustainability, and that really did lead to not having that 150th new innovation, but really being very real about a focus on sustainability that would lead to the greatest profitability and top line for us. So, we're not really making any changes related to COVID, but I feel really good about the work that we did a couple of years ago, changing our innovation strategy to make sure that we really did have that focus. Across the balance levers, innovation is one of five or six levers, if not the lever.\nKen Zaslow: Okay. And then, when I think about the longer term and obviously, the COVID-19 is evolving for sure, but are there certain milestones, are there certain things that would have to happen for you to rethink -- it seems like, as of now -- let me start with this, as of now, it doesn't seem like you've been meeting structural changes to your business model, changed a little bit of investment here and there, but nothing that would be longer term. Are there anything that you would see in the COVID-19 implications that cause you to have to do something, and what would that thing be that you would have to do to change your business model, if that makes sense?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So I guess, I would say there is nothing that I would say is a big fundamental shift to our business model. There are some changes. So for example, e-commerce, the acceleration in e-commerce is here to stay where consumers are in terms of household penetration of people buying online is where we thought it would be maybe five years from now. So to some degree, that is a shift because e-commerce is a little more than a channel. It's almost the business model as well. So fortunately, a few years back, we had invested to build capability in e-commerce, and I feel really good that we were set up to be able to take advantage of that, but we are taking some further steps internally to develop e-commerce to really now be one of our mainstream channels versus before it was kind of I'd say in the growth development phase. There are other consumer trends, things like cocooning and people staying at home, the importance of value on the short term, some of those trends that we are making some changes to adapt to, but we always change -- adapt to ever-changing consumer trend. So I wouldn't really call those out as business model changes. And then, certainly, there will be some changes in terms of how we work in terms of some people working more from home, the ability to have people working remotely, potentially a shift to suburban and rural settings, which actually can be a strength for us. But I would say, e-commerce is probably what I would put in the -- in one of the bigger shifts like that. Steve, is there anything you would...\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. Just -- if I turn the question around, I would say COVID has also shown us places where we have strengths through this and having the agility in our supply chain, the retail execution capability, as Michele said, the digital investments, the agile investment approach, I think those are things that we've learned are even stronger in this kind of environment.\nKen Zaslow: What if, Steve, refreshment like everybody is working from home a little bit more, people don't need to have their meetings and so, your refreshment category may change dramatically or maybe the size of Halloween or the size of Easter may kind of contract. Are there thoughts on those two potential outcomes, or at this point, you would say not really something that we'd be worried about? And I'll leave it there, and I appreciate your time.\nMichele Buck: I mean, first of all, based on seasons, I would say not something that I'd be worried about at this point in time, given the results that we saw on Easter, which was really in a peak period of people being told not to go to grocery stores, and we still had a pretty decent Easter. I mean obviously, we will all learn more as we go through every one of these, but at this point in time, I don't see a major business model shift needing to come from that. And I would say from a refreshment perspective, yes, people will be working from home, but people are also going to be going out and they're going to be out in about doing things, I think, more so. There could be some -- I'm going to say more shifts as there always are in portfolio relative to people baking more, people doing one thing or the other more, but not that I think -- I really think about as a massive business model shift.\nKen Zaslow: Great. I really appreciate it. Stay safe.\nMichele Buck: Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Poole for any final comments.\nMichele Buck: All right. So it's Michele. I just want to thank you all for joining us this morning. As you know, this was a new format for us, and I hope that you found it helpful. Let me close with some very brief remarks. Over the years, our great brands, our advantaged margin structure and our consumer-centric strategies have enabled us to navigate volatile environments and consistently deliver strong stockholder returns. We take great pride in our passion to create new ideas, innovation and ways to connect consumers to continue to make moments of goodness in their lives. With our relentless focus on the consumer, an adaptive operating model and our remarkable team of people, we are confident that we can once again respond to the changes in the marketplace to deliver growth and unlock long-term value for our stockholders. Melissa, we'll be available after the call to answer any additional questions you may have. Thank you very much. Stay safe and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Steve Voskuil",
            "content": "Thanks, Michele, and good morning, everyone. Before reviewing the detailed results for the second quarter, I want to build on Michele's remarks and commend our team's ability to adapt, execute and make smart decisions quickly during this unprecedented time. While our top line was challenged due to COVID-19-related softness in certain areas of the business, and we incurred incremental costs related to the pandemic, strong price realization in North America and proactive cost management allowed us to sustain profitability and deliver earnings in line with last year. As we look to the balance of the year, we anticipate incremental improvement to our top line, and feel good about the plans we have in place to continue to adapt and manage the opportunities and challenges that may arise in this dynamic operating environment. During the second quarter, reported net sales decreased by 3.4% versus the same period a year ago, with an organic, constant currency decline of 3.5%. As Michele mentioned, these declines were driven by COVID-19-related pressures to our international and other segment, as well as non-traditional channels in the U.S., such as food service and specialty retail. These declines were partially offset by strength in our confection business in measured channels, which benefited from elevated at-home demand and strong price realization. Despite these top line challenges and incremental COVID-19-related manufacturing costs, price realization and productivity savings enabled us to maintain our peer-leading adjusted gross margin of 46.4% in the second quarter, relatively in line with prior year. Adjusted operating profit increased 4.4% in the second quarter, resulting in a 170-basis-point improvement to operating profit margin versus the prior year period. Incremental incentives, cleaning and PPE costs were more than offset by travel and meeting expense favorability, as well as marketing spend optimization to align with consumer demand changes in the quarter. In North America, organic, constant currency sales growth of 0.4% was driven by pricing and elevated at home consumption of our chocolate and baking items. This was partially offset by sales declines in foodservice, specialty retail and our refreshment brands due to COVID-19. Price realization contributed 4.2 points in the quarter, which was slightly ahead of expectations, due to incremental trade efficiencies realized from revenue management and selective programming choices related to COVID-19. We continue to expect second half price realization to be approximately 1.5 to 2 points, driven primarily by our July 2019 price increase. Food service, specialty retail and refreshment were each down approximately 40% during the second quarter. We continue to expect these businesses to be negatively impacted by COVID-19 during the balance of the year, but improve incrementally as the economy and consumer mobility continue to recover. In measured channels, retail takeaway for Hershey was 4.1% for the second quarter, driven by strength in demand for our take-home confection and baking businesses, and strong execution by our supply chain to ensure product was available and on-shelf. We did not see this fully flow through to net sales, as retailer inventory levels continued to be depleted to satisfy a portion of this demand. As a result, we expect these inventory levels to be replenished in the coming months, contributing approximately one to two points of growth in the second half the year. Adjusted gross margin for the North America segment expanded 20 basis points to 47.5% for the second quarter, driven by strong price realization, which more than offset a challenging 2019 lap of favorable mix and incremental COVID-19-related costs for incentives, cleaning and PPE. Mix was a slight headwind for the quarter, driven primarily by lapping the significant mix benefit from Q2 of 2019, versus COVID-19- driven mix shifts this year. As Michele mentioned, our instant consumable business has continued to grow, which has helped maintain our margin strength. As a result, we do not anticipate mix being a material driver of earnings in the second half. North America advertising and related consumer marketing spend decreased 10.8% in the second quarter, driven by media cost efficiencies and selective programming optimization related to COVID-19. Approximately half of our spend reduction was driven by favorable digital media costs in the marketplace, a portion of which we expect to sustain in the second half. The remaining declines were driven by reduced investment in brands negatively impacted by COVID-19 trends, including IceBreakers and select chocolate brands that are disproportionately sold in the convenience store class of trade. As consumer trends improved in May and June, we began reinvesting in these businesses. These actions are a testament to our capabilities and willingness to adapt quickly to changes in the marketplace. As we look to the balance of the year, we will continue to be mindful of the evolving operating environment, but plan to invest more in advertising and consumer marketing as sales trends improve. In our international and other segment, organic, constant currency sales declined 33.4% in the second quarter, driven by COVID-19-related softness in our owned Chocolate World retail locations, large declines in air travel and performance in key international markets. Combined constant currency net sales in Mexico, Brazil, India and China declined 31.8% versus the second quarter in 2019. As Michele mentioned, we expect our international business to be slower to recover and likely challenged for the balance of year because of both COVID-19-related restrictions and economic conditions impacting consumer participation in the chocolate category. Our owned retail businesses were closed for nearly the entire second quarter, though all have reopened on a limited basis with appropriate COVID-19-related precautions. While our stores have reopened, we do expect significantly decreased foot traffic during the second half of the year and, therefore, expect sales to remain below prior year levels. Given these declines to the top line, we have taken a disciplined look at our variable cost base and optimized where feasible, while still maintaining the appropriate level of brand investment. This resulted in savings in advertising and related consumer marketing, along with travel expenses of approximately $15 million. The segment reported a slightly negative operating income of $4 million for the second quarter. We continue to expect gradual recovery throughout the second half of the year, but do not expect the segment to return to the same level as last year. While this segment has borne the greatest impact from COVID-19, we remain committed to the right balance of investment and support to ensure acceleration post COVID-19. Shifting to items below operating profit, interest expense was $38 million for the second quarter, an increase of $4.3 million, versus the same period a year ago, due to higher debt balances from debt issuances in October 2019. Other expense of $11.2 million represented a decline of $1.9 million, due to the purchase of fewer tax credits and lower non-service-related pension expense. The adjusted tax rate in the second quarter increased by 4.6% to 19.4%. This increase was due to the lapping of a prior period benefit related to the release of valuation allowances in select international markets. At this time, we do not anticipate any material changes to the tax and other income/expense outlook that we shared with you in January.We do, however, expect interest expense to marginally increase over the prior year due to the bond issuance in October 2019 and May 2020. Despite any short-term challenges posed by COVID-19, we remain confident in our strong cash flow and healthy balance sheet to manage through the current crisis and beyond. At the end of the second quarter, we had approximately $1.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet, an increase of $800 million versus last year, and $614 million in operating cash flow. To further mitigate potential risk and to take advantage of favorable rates in the capital markets, we issued $1 billion of bonds in the second quarter with staggered maturities, while paying long-term debt of $350 million that came due in May. We continue to have a peer-leading capital structure, providing agility to adapt to the dynamic environment we are operating in. Given our strong free cash flow and liquidity, we remain committed to our long-term capital priorities, with a balanced approach to investing in the business and returning cash to our stockholders, all while managing through this volatile environment. First, let's discuss our commitment to reinvestment. In the second quarter, total capital additions, including software, were approximately $87 million, bringing our-year-to date investment to $186 million. As discussed in April, our revised capital spending full year outlook of $400 million to $450 million reflects selectively pausing portions of our ERP transformation and supply chain capacity and capability initiative. Both ERP and our supply chain initiative, while re-phased, remain on track and are critical capabilities to deliver our long-term strategic initiatives. Now, shifting to returning cash to our stockholders, which remains a steadfast priority in our capital allocation strategy, earlier this morning, we announced our third quarter dividend, reflecting a 4% increase. While the Company did not repurchase any shares in the second quarter against the July 2018 $500 million authorization, we did repurchase $42 million of common stock in connection with replenishment of stock options. We remain confident that our balanced approach to business investment and returning cash to stockholders will continue to provide sustained stockholder returns now and in the future. As you saw in the press release, we are not providing new 2020 fiscal guidance at this time. While the Company's performance improved over the course of the second quarter, the impact of recent spikes in coronavirus cases on consumer mobility, retail operations, governmental regulations and the macroeconomic environment remains unclear. With that being said, we do want to provide some visibility into our latest thinking for the balance of the year, which is based on our current understanding of the operating environment. In the North America segment, the Company expects accelerated sales growth in the second half of the year driven by elevated at-home consumption, price realization and the replenishment of retailer and distributor inventory levels. These gains are anticipated to offset improving, but still pressured, sales in the food service and specialty retail channels. The Company does not currently expect seasonal performance to have a material impact on second half financial results, though the impact of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases on consumer participation in seasonal activities remains uncertain. In the international and other segment, the Company expects demand to slowly rebound in the second half of the year, but remain below prior year levels as owned stores, travel retail and developing markets recover more slowly. Finally, as it relates to sales, during the second quarter, we completed the planned divestitures of our Krave, Dagoba and Scharffenberger brands. These divestitures are expected to have a relatively small 20-basis-point impact to sales in the second half and an immaterial impact to earnings per share. Solid price realization and strong cost management are anticipated to offset some of the incremental COVID-19 costs we are facing. COVID-19 costs are expected to be less in the second half of the year, mainly for increased plant sanitation and personal protective equipment for Manufacturing and Sales Teams. We anticipate that price realization will continue to drive gross margin gains, though to a lesser extent than the first half of the year, as we begin to lap the announcement of the 2019 price increase. Selling, general and administrative expenses should continue to show favorability in the back half of the year, behind lower travel and meeting expenses and favorable incentive compensation versus prior year. Finally, as it relates to brand investment, we intend to continue investing in North America and further optimize spend in the international and other segment in accordance with expected sales trends. While we have not issued new guidance today, we hope this additional perspective is helpful to understand our approach to managing through the crisis and our high level expectations for the next several months pending the continued evolution of the pandemic. We remain confident in our team, our plan and our agile operating model to deliver solid shareholder returns this year and in the future. Now, I will turn it back to Michele. Good morning. So yes, I -- here we're going to -- we look at revenue management all the time. And so, driving trade efficiency is part of the base plan, but as Michele said, the outsized impact that we saw in the second quarter was really more data issue. We were out in stores, Smores were out; Twizzlers were out, so we had quite a bit of promotion. Yes. I'd be happy to take that. You're quite right. Q2 turned out to be more favorable from a margin standpoint than we expected going in. While we had incentives, some of those incentives were less than what we had expected for the quarter. Insurance costs that we had expected for the second quarter came out more favorably. We talked on the last call about productivity, and productivity being a risk for the quarter and in fact, the productivity goals in manufacturing were still achieved. Probably, the lingering piece, PPE and cleaning costs, that will continue. So we kind of take Q2 and look to the future, obviously the incentives based on everything we know today are about returning. Productivity, we expect to continue along with our full-year plan. PP&E is not a big cost in the quarter, so I think $3 million, $4 million a quarter as a benchmark. We will continue to drive SG&A savings both at the corporate level with travel and meetings, as well as at the division level. And then, as you said, we're going to spend a little bit more back from a DME standpoint. So while we had an opportunity in Q2 to optimize, probably optimize a little bit more than we had expected. We are going to invest back more behind the brands as we get to the back half of the year, so -- and a little bit less pricing benefit as well. We've had a lot of pricing benefit across the first half. As we lap now, that will also start to come off. So those are the big drivers. That's the reason, again not giving specific guidance, but expecting some margin acceleration in the back half. And meanwhile, some of the new innovations that we brought to market that you have done quite well. So where we brought in new SKUs, whether it was Kit Kat Birthday or Take 5. Yes, I agree. Certainly on the pricing for some of the media exposure that came down, that was a big benefit. I think we did benefit from tools and investments we made around marketing efficiencies and driving ROI and optimizing. We haven't talked as much about some of those tools, tools both on trade efficiency, but also marketing spend efficiency. And those tools allowed us also to be more agile as things evolved quickly. And so, that part is something we'll look to leverage further in the future. No. I agree. I think for the things we can see and certainly, the things we can control, we're optimistic, but part of the reason for not providing more specific guidance is, there are things we can't control and probably can't see. And for those reasons, there still is potential variability in the back half, but everything we can see gives us a plenty of confidence. In terms of just COVID related costs? Yes, probably on the order of \u2013 for the gross margin somewhere between $15 million and $20 million of COVID-related costs. Again, we had predicted it might be more than that. In fact, it came out less. As we go forward in the rest of the year, the biggest piece that will stick around is going to be that personal protective equipment, cleaning costs and so, if I take that $15 million to $20 million, think about maybe a third or a quarter becomes sticky to the back half. Our international team does a great job of looking to optimize their P&L and cost structure on an ongoing basis. And certainly, the new opportunity here is that business, I think, curtailed in some markets, has shown even further potential there, but I think to Michele's earlier point, the strategic priority of international hasn't changed. And so, we want to continue to appropriately invest behind those businesses to unlock the long-term growth that we believe is there. But to your point, certainly, we will never waste the crisis in terms of looking at every possible way to be efficient with P&L. Yes. The progress that we made in the second quarter, we said from the travel and meetings standpoint was actually better than we expected going into the quarter. And given everything we see today, business has not returned to whatever normal was. And so, we expect in the back half, we're going to see those savings continue. As I think about the second quarter, we saw probably $20 million, $15 million to $20 million of opportunity across all of those areas. And I would expect to see something like that, maybe a little bit less, but something like that in the back half as well. And beyond that, that was really the biggest driver from a corporate cost standpoint. Yes. Just -- if I turn the question around, I would say COVID has also shown us places where we have strengths through this and having the agility in our supply chain, the retail execution capability, as Michele said, the digital investments, the agile investment approach, I think those are things that we've learned are even stronger in this kind of environment. Thank you."

            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Thank you, Melissa, and good morning, everyone. On behalf of the entire Company, we hope you, your colleagues and your loved ones are continuing to stay safe and healthy. We have all experienced significant change and new challenges over these past several months. Things we never predicted are now realities that we are all adapting to. Things we thought would evolve over the course of several years have changed in weeks. I could not be prouder of the Hershey organization for how they have responded. At the center of our culture is the shared believe that Hershey and its people stand for togetherness, integrity, excellence and making a difference. These values have shined even more brightly over the past several months. Our teams have worked together tirelessly to keep each other safe, our supply chain running, our customers' needs met, and our consumers stocked with snacks that make their lives a little more delicious during these very difficult times. Our teammates have done this with a care and compassion for each other and the communities in which they live, and they are energized and inspired to leverage this moment to drive positive change for the future. I want to thank the entire organization, from retail to manufacturing and across our corporate international and regional offices, for the hard work and commitment they bring every day. The marketplace remains volatile as the virus and consumer behavior evolves. We saw significant changes as we progressed through the second quarter, but our teams did a fantastic job of adapting to these changes and continued to execute exceptionally well. The first half of the quarter was particularly challenging, as global economic growth contracted and government-mandated restrictions and closures impacted consumer mobility and, in turn, our performance. We did see an improvement later in the quarter as economies began to reopen and consumers returned to more activities outside the home. We continue to feel good about our long-term strategies and the strength we saw in our core products and channels during the quarter. Despite new challenges and increased complexities, we delivered profitable category-leading sales growth in North America. These gains were offset by sales declines in areas heavily impacted by the pandemic and related government restrictions and consumer mobility limitations. Our agile investment mindset enabled us to quickly pivot and mitigate sales declines in areas impacted by consumer mobility restrictions. In addition, our advantaged margin structure and strong cost management helped us to mitigate incremental COVID-19-related costs to enable us to deliver adjusted earnings per share in line with last year. We expect accelerated sales growth in the second half of the year, based on momentum exiting the quarter, assuming there's no significant disruption to current consumer trends. We also expect pricing and strong cost management to drive margin expansion and earnings growth in the second half of the year. Now, let me share some details on our North American business. While we have seen significant channel disruption and changes in consumer behavior, our brands and categories remain an important part of consumers' lives and have performed relatively well. We saw strong performance in the food, mass, dollar and e-commerce classes of trade, consistent with broader channel trends. Our e-commerce sales growth remains significantly higher than our pre-COVID baseline, with year-over-year sales growth accelerating further in the second quarter to 200%. Category trends in drug, convenience and club channels were more pressured, though all sequentially improved as we progressed through the quarter as consumers returned to more normal activities away from home. While COVID-19 has impacted traffic to some key channels in the short-term, we continue to believe our channel diversification is a long-term strategic advantage. Despite some of these pressures, our combined retail takeaway in measured channels was up over 4% in the quarter and it was up almost 9% in June. Importantly, we are winning share in every channel this year, and our share growth is strongest in the largest channels that are experiencing the most growth. We are leading not only through our portfolio of iconic brands, consumer relevant marketing and strong execution, but with our thought leadership, as well. Within confection, this has enabled us to drive growth that far exceeds the category and expand our number one share position in the U.S. Our category share grew 225 basis points in the second quarter, bringing our year-to-date share gain to 150 basis points. The chocolate category is performing well, with growth of approximately 4% in measured channels for the first half of the year, despite a shorter Easter. Everyday chocolate sales have consistently grown 9% since the pandemic began. While take-home products are driving outsized growth, instant consumable products are also growing. Hershey's has outperformed the category, with sales growth across brands that accelerated as we progressed through the quarter. In June, Hershey's chocolate portfolio grew 13%, with Reese's, Hershey's and Kit Kat brands each growing 14%. Key variety brands, such as PayDay, York, Almond Joy, Mounds, Heath and Rolo, also all grew during the month, resulting in a combined growth rate of over 11%. Our key chocolate innovation is also performing well. As we discussed in April, much of our innovation was launched prior to the pandemic hitting the U.S. Despite softening convenience store trends in the quarter, our instant consumable innovation remains on track. Our Reese's Take 5 relaunch is set to double the size of the brand this year to approximately $70 million of retail sales, and our Kit Kat flavor innovation is doing very well, with Kit Kat Duos and Kit Kat Birthday Cake both driving incremental brand household penetration and frequency. Distribution of our new THINS innovation was delayed slightly by the pandemic at several customers, but it's now in full distribution and velocities are strong. We have secured strong merchandising in-store for our key summer promotions, including Smores, Twizzlers and our Reese's Lovers In and Out Promotions. Our teams have shown great agility to adjust messaging and deliver consumer-relevant content to drive growth of 14% on these programs versus last year. Our Twizzlers and Jolly Rancher brands grew a combined 6% in the second quarter, also ahead of the category. Our strong in-store merchandising on Twizzlers has been amplified by consumer-relevant marketing to drive accelerated growth this summer as consumers enjoy this classic treat while watching movies at home or in the car on their summer road trips. As we mentioned in April, the refreshment category has been negatively impacted by social distancing, as the functional need for breath freshening has lessened. While trends have improved since April, the category continued to decline 20% to 25% in June. Our business has trended relatively in line with the category. We expect category trends to remain challenged until social distancing guidelines relax. Sales for our baking items are performing exceptionally well, with growth of over 40% in the second quarter. This growth was across products, including syrup, baking chips, toppings and cocoa, as consumers spend more time at home together in the kitchen. We have capitalized on this trend to sustain momentum, increasing marketing spend and generating more content and recipes for our consumers. This is important for the second half of the year, when baking takes on an even bigger role in U.S. households. Finally, let me touch on our better-for-you snack portfolio. Our salty snack brands have shown solid growth this year. As we shared on our call in April, we did experience some softness early in the second quarter, as our in-store presence and supply was negatively impacted by COVID-19. We worked quickly to improve our execution and in-store distribution and merchandising, resulting in accelerated performance in late May and June. In the month of June, our Skinny Pop and Pirate's Booty brands grew 8.4% and 3.7%, respectively, in measured channels, and total sales growth outpaced these levels, bolstered by strong growth in club and e-commerce. While we saw strong sales growth in measured channels, as expected, this was partially offset by significant declines in our food service and specialty retail businesses. Trends improved as we progressed through the quarter as many locations re-opened; however, traffic and sales remained below prior year levels in June. While we expect the second half headwind in these channels to be less severe than the second quarter impact, uncertainty remains as consumer behaviors continue to evolve, COVID-19 cases rise and regions consider mitigating actions to control the spread of the virus. Before I discuss our international segment, let me spend a few minutes providing an update on Halloween. As many of you know, Halloween is our largest season and it represents approximately 10% of our annual sales. We begin manufacturing product in the second quarter and primarily ship product to stores in the third quarter. Halloween celebrations are likely to be different this year, with an earlier start to the season and more geographic differences than in prior years. We expect that there will be more at-home activities, with families sharing timeless traditions and new ways for people to celebrate with neighbors. It is important to note that nearly 50% of Halloween candy spend is on \u201ctreat for me\u201d and \u201ccandy bowl\u201d occasions, which start early in the season. Trick or treating represents the other 50% of the season, with sales concentrated in the last two weeks of October. While research indicates trick-or-treating participation will likely be below prior year levels due to COVID-19 concerns, the expectation of this holiday tradition has been consistently improving over the past several weeks. We expect to outperform the category given our iconic brands, strong innovation and merchandising, and great execution. While we have visibility to orders and current consumer intentions, we expect the virus and consumer sentiment to evolve in the months leading up to the season, which could present some risk to sell-through.  We will continue to monitor consumer behavior and local guidelines and partner with our retailers to help consumers celebrate the season of Halloween during this uncertain time. Now, let me shift gears and discuss our international and other segment. As anticipated, second quarter results were significantly impacted by COVID-19. As we shared in April, our owned retail Chocolate World locations were closed during the second quarter and we saw a meaningful impact on our travel retail business as air travel declined. While our locations have begun to reopen and air travel is beginning to improve, traffic remains well below historical levels and we anticipate a slower recovery in these channels. In several of our key international markets -- notably, Mexico, India and Brazil -- we have seen a significant increase in coronavirus cases over the past several months. While measures to stem the spread of the virus have varied by country, we have consistently seen these measures and their associated economic impact pressure chocolate category sales. In many of these markets, chocolate consumption is not as embedded in the culture as it is in the United States, and it is premium priced versus other food and snacking options. Category trends did improve as the quarter progressed, but they remain below prior year levels. While we saw strength in some of our other items in key markets, such as cocoa powder, syrup and spreads, it wasn't enough to offset the chocolate declines. We have responded to these recent trends and scaled back investments accordingly to help mitigate the COVID-19 impact on our business. We remain committed to our international strategy over the long-term and we will maintain an appropriate level of investment to capture opportunities as the macroeconomic environment and pandemic improve. Now, let me turn it over to Steve to provide some more details of our financial results, as well as our outlook for the rest of the year. Steve? Thanks, Steve. During a time of extraordinary changes and challenges this quarter, our teams responded with agility and executed well against factors within our control. We have balanced delivering today with making calculated investments that we believe will enable us to emerge even stronger after the pandemic. In times of risk and crisis, cultures are either strengthened or weakened. Hershey has come together and thrived as a team, committed to serving our consumers and our communities. Our purpose and commitment to operating sustainably and responsibly continues to move us forward. Last month, we released our 2019 sustainability report that highlights some of the great progress we have made in this space, as well as some of our key priorities for the future. I encourage you to go to our website and take a look. In addition to the sustainability report, you will also find information on some of our more recent actions and pledges. Let me take a minute to discuss two that are top of mind related to recent events. We have long supported our communities and given the unprecedented need many are facing right now, we have amplified these efforts. In addition to increasing our product and monetary donations, we have invested in our own mask production line to service our employees, their families and our communities. Second, for many years, we have pursued a vision of building a more diverse and inclusive company. We have been recognized for our progress, including being named the top food company for diversity by Diversity Inc. Recently, we initiated a company-wide dialogue to listen, learn and grow together. Through that dialogue, we have seen the very best of our Hershey culture, and a genuine desire to do more in the fight against systemic racism. We announced a set of initiatives to support Black and Brown communities and accelerate increasing Black and Brown representation and internal development at Hershey and amongst our key partners to promote social and economic progress. We believe these initiatives will help address the need for meaningful, long-term change in our society, and include evolving our approach to recruiting, talent development, training and reporting, as well as pledging monetary donations to organizations to actively fight systematic racism. To close, we believe Hershey is well positioned to adapt and succeed over the long term. We have scale brands in growing categories that consumers love and trust, we have a highly efficient, yet agile, supply chain that we are investing in for the future, we have advantaged capabilities in analytics, media, category management and sales, that we believe position us well to drive profitable growth in the future, and we have a team that is dedicated to our purpose of making more moments of goodness. We remain confident and committed to our long-term strategies and financial targets. With that, we conclude our prepared remarks this morning. Thank you for your time this morning. I invite you to listen to our live question-and-answer webcast, which will begin today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time, and will be available at thehersheycompany.com. Thank you. Hi Chris. Good morning. Yes. So inventory was about 1.5 point to 2 point headwind on our first half growth, and there were really a couple of factors that drove that. Part of it is, as you recall last year, we had a build of inventory as retailers were perhaps anticipating a price increase. So the lap from that creates part of that. Secondly, we were depleting inventory as a result of consumer stock-ups and the acceleration that we saw in takeaway across our portfolio. So we've been working really hard and had very strong customer service levels versus the industry. But yet, we've still been continuing to replenish to kind of catch up with that accelerated demand. And then, the third factor that really falls into that equation is non-measured channel softness. We've talked to you about owned retail locations, world travel retail, the foodservice, some of those businesses that don't show up in measured happen to be the same ones where we have some of the greatest softness. So the -- so the Halloween piece is not really a factor in that inventory piece. It is much more around the everyday businesses on the non-measured channel. So first of all, as we look at the promotional pricing that you see as you look at some of the retail scanner data, we do not believe that data is correct. There is a lot less auditing going on during this time than previously. So the biggest issue we think there is we think simply the data is just not correct. We are continuing to see the kind of promotional activity that we had planned in the second quarter behind Smores, Twizzlers, our Reese's In and Out lever promotion. And going forward, we feel good about the promotional plans that we have in the back half of the year with our retail partners. No. I mean, we remain committed to the pricing strategy that we've discussed with all of you before, and that's really behind smaller more frequent price increases. While we have price each of the last two years, that certainly doesn't mean within our strategy that we have plans to price every single year. We really take a strategic approach where we look at opportunities across the portfolio. Right now, all of our pricing initiatives remain on track, and we continue to think that we're going to see price realization in the second half. But as you know, we have several different levers that we rely on to drive the business. Pricing is one of those, but brand investment, key retailer initiatives, innovation, merchandising and new capabilities, that balanced portfolio levers to drive growth is something we really believe in, and we think that that's very important. So we take a lot of variables into consideration when we decide, what to price, when to price, how to price, and we will be consistent with the stated strategy going forward. Yes. So relative to pricing, our plans were not impacted or changed for the year. It is correct that we have a third in portfolio that wasn't priced in those actions, but we did not change our plans throughout the year on pricing. So we just continue to look across and decide when and what and Halloween was the right time. Relative to Mexico, we certainly have seen big disruptions in that market. And I would say -- I wouldn't put it as much certainly -- there are certainly pockets of Mexico where there are economic issues, but the biggest factor in Mexico has really been the trade, the spread of the virus and then the shutdown of key elements of the trade specifically, the wholesaler network, distributor network where we have about 50% of our business. And so, it was really the trade shutdown that impacted our business in Mexico. I think that we have been appropriately conservative. I think we have partnered with our retailers. So we've utilized that visibility. We've taken into account what we think the category will be. And importantly, we've also taken into account what we believe our market share of the category will be based on recent performance and what's happening in the marketplace right now. So I think if we see pressures in Halloween, that's probably going to show up more toward Q4 than Q3 as it will be at that -- those end periods post the holiday relative to sell-through at that point in time. Steve you want to hit that one? Yes. Absolutely. I guess, I'd start by saying, even pre-COVID, we had very good momentum in both takeaway and market share starting last year. And we really attribute that to the balanced activation plan and great execution that we had even then, which was a good -- I think the right balance across advertising, distribution, pricing, seasons and innovation, kinds of that suite of levers that we have. Obviously, since COVID, as you mentioned, our team has really stepped up relative to execution keeping product on shelf, while there were some struggles among some other competitors in the marketplace. And certainly, we do know some competitors also begin to rationalize SKUs to simplify their portfolios. So we do believe that the recent share performance is likely to persist for several more months. And while we do think that huge game that we're seeing is likely to revert next year as we lap the strengths, we do believe that some of the gains will remain in the long term and sustain. So we did pull back a little bit in the second quarter and that was primarily around refreshment given what was going on with refreshment being so incredibly soft and the functional demand just not being there as much for that product, especially given its presence in convenience stores and also a bit on grocery just because that part of the business was doing so incredibly well on its own. A little bit on Smores, we had really strong demand on Smores, but what I would say is, the trends are now stabilizing as the most severe declines on certain parts or most severe accelerations on parts of the portfolio in Q2. We saw the wildest swings and those tend to be stabilizing a bit now. So we are kind of going back to a more normalizing approach. It wasn't a huge pullback in Q2. It was very selective against those parts of the portfolio. Does that help? Yes. So we had already really embarked upon SKU rationalization program really over the past two, 2.5 years. So we had pretty aggressively taken a look across our portfolio and made a lot of those cuts. So at this point in time, we're feeling pretty good about where we are. I don't see a major program. Obviously, it's always an ongoing focus to optimize and to cut some of the small things, but the biggest steps we had already taken previously. Yes. So starting with your first question, we definitely have seen retailers, especially during the COVID situation, dial up their focus on power SKUs, must-have SKUs, really because of the huge consumer demand and needing to make sure that they were in stock on the most important items and also just because of labor needs and all of that just a focus on what's really going to deliver the business. I think that's what -- why you're seeing. Many of the manufacturers also now started to really rethink their portfolios to do the same. So I would say, yes, I think the retail trade is saying, hey, right now, this is a time where we need to focus on those biggest most important items. So I think you're right about that. And then, I'm sorry, remind me again, your second question? Snack cake. Yes. So we have seen some similarity, some crossover in terms of candy and snack cake consumption. They both have some similar traits in terms of really hitting the kind of the treat sweet tooth and filling certain needs for consumers that are similar. So I think we have seen some of that crossover certainly from consumers. So we haven't really seen any material changes in July versus our trends. So there are some geographic differences, just given the big differential across geographies as a result of COVID. So now, I would say we're feeling good about what we continue to see. And market share is pretty consistent though. In terms of our market share performance, I would say we're feeling pretty good in terms of continuation of that trend. Yes. And we certainly -- those are some of the benefits that I think you don't always see immediately because you have planogram timing, etc., to realize those benefits. So some of those benefits, I think, we started to see in June and that might be what's driving some of our continued trends -- positive trends in July. Yes. Good morning. Well, Halloween, we've said previously, is about 10% of our full-year business. Certainly, seasons are higher in the second half than they are in the first half because Valentine's is our smallest holiday. So you really have Easter as a big one in the first half. We don't really want to get into some of the specifics by quarter. But I would say that the season's impact is definitely bigger in the second half than the first half. I think your math is generally correct. I can't argue with the math. The one thing I would say is you're speaking specifically to measured channels, and you need to remember the impact of non-measured channels, owned retail, foodservice, air travel, world travel retail, which is airline and the trends on those businesses as that does -- that has been as we've shared the biggest hit in our business. So while those channels are certainly not shut down like they were in Q2, they're in the recovery mode. And the recovery mode is definitely going to be a slow uptick. I mean, I think SG&A is clearly an area that we're expecting that how much we need to spend will change permanently over time. So I think that piece, yes. I think on the marketing expenses, it's a little bit different. Certainly, some of our pullbacks were as a result of certain businesses like refreshment that were down 40%. We just didn't think it made sense to be spending into that. Then, part of what we were able to do was to leverage the fact that a lot of advertisers dropped out of the marketplace and as a result, the costs of media were less than we had planned them to be. And so, we were able to have a nice outcome there. As advertisers come back into the marketplace, some of that pricing benefit is not going to be available anymore. So while there may be some ongoing efficiencies and we are always looking to tighten our data knowledge and have capabilities around media since we are big spenders to get more for our money, and we're always building capability to take it to the next level. There were some unique circumstances there as well. Yes. I mean, I think the confidence drivers are orders in hand. Some of the dynamics that exist around the fact that only half of that Halloween volume is trick-or-treat. The fact that the trick-or-treat behavior is outdoor. People do wear masks. So as we get closer, we're feeling good about that. Now obviously -- certainly, we didn't provide official guidance in the back half of the year. And there is uncertainty and volatility overall given the virus, but based on everything that we know and the visibility we have and with every day we get closer, we feel that we've taken an appropriate look at what we think can happen and have really factored that into our outlook as best possible. We've mitigated some of the downside risks with the everyday portfolio versus all the Halloween packaging. Steve, anything you would like -- Yes. I mean, I think that's generally correct. We are seeing a rebound in convenience stores as people are out and about more. And I think also as some people are choosing not to travel via air, but do vacations that are more driving vacation, so I think that's helping as well. So yes, I think certainly instant consumable and that class of trade are helping the business. We're also seeing instant consumable strong and strength in other classes of trade as people have returned more now to grocery stores and trips and shopping. So the strength is not just in convenience stores. So that is helping our margin mix. Yes. That is fair. It has definitely -- we're seeing growth on the instant consumable piece of the business and again, I think a lot of that due to more traffic in those channels. Yes. Yes. Good morning. Yes. So, we have continued to see our category and our business perform really well in e-commerce and seen that growth accelerate. So in the second quarter, we saw a growth of 200% on our e-commerce business, and that was really driven by strengths, both in the click-and-collect kind of pickup and in delivery fulfillment models. So, we saw growth across the board there. You're right that we tend to have a little bit of a softer business during the hottest months in the summer, but we're continuing to see that pretty strong growth even throughout June. So I think just the trends are bolstering that. And that growth, importantly, we're seeing across every piece of the business is a seasoned take-home and instant consumables. So in the past, we've spoken about e-commerce being roughly 2% of our business, and we believe that this channel by end of year could approximate about 5% of our total company sales, so definitely seeing a lot of strength there. When it comes to marketing mix, certainly, we're seeing efficiencies that we're going to realize in the back half in that TV class of trade. So it continues to be a really viable for a place for us to put money, given the very high household penetration on our business, and the sheer number of eyeballs that you can reach on TV is very efficient. And as we look to digital and the pullback on Facebook, we see taking those funds that were in Facebook and redirecting them still back into other digital media venues. So that -- those dollars will stay in digital, but just on other platforms like YouTube, for example. Yes. So we are gaining market share across most of our international markets. So we feel great about that. The weakness that we're seeing is really driven either by the COVID-related shutdowns in most of the markets, government-restricted shutdowns and especially in a lot of those developing markets. And in some markets, the economic impact of that, that impacts the category, but we feel great that we're winning share across most of those markets. So I don't think that we will slip relative to our strategic emphasis. We are still committed to what we want to get achieved in those markets. We still believe in the long-term potential on those markets. So we are pulling back on a temporary basis just consistent with where the business is, but continuing our focus on all of our key initiatives to win long term in those markets. We consider a lot of factors as we're trying to decide how to think about how and when to price. So as it comes to recessionary times, over the past, we've seen that our category tends to have less of the highs and lows that some other categories have, because we are an affordable luxury, so at times, when people need to cut back on other categories. So I -- we will continue to just evaluate all the different factors for when, how, on what we will take pricing. But we aren't particularly concerned that we can't price in recessionary times. We have done that at the point in the past. Yes. I mean, we are expecting based on our partnerships with retailers, very strong in-store support for Halloween with most of our retailers. We partner with every retailer, and each retailer has their own strategy in terms of how much they support the holiday. And so, I think in general, most of them are continuing to lean in to anticipate and drive to a very strong Halloween. And we believe that given our ability to execute during this time and some of the -- you've seen the results of that on the share in the marketplace, we certainly think that even our performance within the category for Halloween should be quite strong. Steve, you want to talk about that? Good morning. Yes. So the first thing we're doing is trying to make sure that we ensure sell-through, which is something we always do, which is having the right merchandising, getting product on the floor as early as possible and leveraging media investment to remind consumers, excite consumers about the holiday. Then post-sell-through, there is always a markdown period that occurs based on how much product actually sells through, both in total as well as you have to get the mix right across each piece of the portfolio. And so, every year as we build our plans, we plan for that, and this year is no different. We planned for that. So we tried to mitigate our risk by -- as we look at the trick-or-treat portion of the portfolio pulling back on seasonal packaging, having more every day, so that's one -- another lever we used and then, really working through the markdown plan. Good morning. So I would say we already did that. A few years back, we took a look at our innovation strategy and really streamlined and focused on sustainability, and that really did lead to not having that 150th new innovation, but really being very real about a focus on sustainability that would lead to the greatest profitability and top line for us. So, we're not really making any changes related to COVID, but I feel really good about the work that we did a couple of years ago, changing our innovation strategy to make sure that we really did have that focus. Across the balance levers, innovation is one of five or six levers, if not the lever. Yes. So I guess, I would say there is nothing that I would say is a big fundamental shift to our business model. There are some changes. So for example, e-commerce, the acceleration in e-commerce is here to stay where consumers are in terms of household penetration of people buying online is where we thought it would be maybe five years from now. So to some degree, that is a shift because e-commerce is a little more than a channel. It's almost the business model as well. So fortunately, a few years back, we had invested to build capability in e-commerce, and I feel really good that we were set up to be able to take advantage of that, but we are taking some further steps internally to develop e-commerce to really now be one of our mainstream channels versus before it was kind of I'd say in the growth development phase. There are other consumer trends, things like cocooning and people staying at home, the importance of value on the short term, some of those trends that we are making some changes to adapt to, but we always change -- adapt to ever-changing consumer trend. So I wouldn't really call those out as business model changes. And then, certainly, there will be some changes in terms of how we work in terms of some people working more from home, the ability to have people working remotely, potentially a shift to suburban and rural settings, which actually can be a strength for us. But I would say, e-commerce is probably what I would put in the -- in one of the bigger shifts like that. Steve, is there anything you would... I mean, first of all, based on seasons, I would say not something that I'd be worried about at this point in time, given the results that we saw on Easter, which was really in a peak period of people being told not to go to grocery stores, and we still had a pretty decent Easter. I mean obviously, we will all learn more as we go through every one of these, but at this point in time, I don't see a major business model shift needing to come from that. And I would say from a refreshment perspective, yes, people will be working from home, but people are also going to be going out and they're going to be out in about doing things, I think, more so. There could be some -- I'm going to say more shifts as there always are in portfolio relative to people baking more, people doing one thing or the other more, but not that I think -- I really think about as a massive business model shift. Thank you. All right. So it's Michele. I just want to thank you all for joining us this morning. As you know, this was a new format for us, and I hope that you found it helpful. Let me close with some very brief remarks. Over the years, our great brands, our advantaged margin structure and our consumer-centric strategies have enabled us to navigate volatile environments and consistently deliver strong stockholder returns. We take great pride in our passion to create new ideas, innovation and ways to connect consumers to continue to make moments of goodness in their lives. With our relentless focus on the consumer, an adaptive operating model and our remarkable team of people, we are confident that we can once again respond to the changes in the marketplace to deliver growth and unlock long-term value for our stockholders. Melissa, we'll be available after the call to answer any additional questions you may have. Thank you very much. Stay safe and have a great day."

Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I hope, first of all, that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. We are all experiencing an unparalleled and rapidly evolving global pandemic. Our thoughts go out to those that have been impacted and we'd like to extend our sincere thank you to all of the heroes working to keep people safe during this difficult time. As you all know, food companies play an important role during this crisis, helping to ensure a steady food supply and supporting local economy. We recognized that Hershey is not only a food manufacturer, but also an important link in the broader food supply chain, particularly with farmers and other raw material suppliers that rely on us. I could not be more proud of The Hershey team and how they are responding to this situation, first and foremost, with the care and support they are showing for each other, their families, partners, and communities. But also with their relentless energy and passion to continue to safely operate with excellence. I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of them, especially to those in our manufacturing plants and those working at retail to make moments of goodness for our consumers during these difficult times. The situation continues to evolve so rapidly that it's difficult to predict the future with much certainty. While comparisons can certainly be drawn to weather related disruptions or natural disasters or recessions, the reality is that we have never seen so many factors at play at the same time on such a global scale. But we are committed to being transparent about what we are seeing in the marketplace and what we are doing to respond. We will continue to be forthcoming as we navigate this uncharted territory and we believe we will have more visibility in the coming months as the situation stabilizes. Let me start by saying pre-COVID-19, our business was on track versus our expectations, both in Q1 and our outlook for the full year. Now, let me share some details around what we are doing from an operations perspective, before I discuss what we are seeing in terms of consumer behavior. The health and safety of our Hershey team remains paramount in our decision-making and action. Food safety has always been at the center of our day-to-day operations, and that will continue. As the pandemic spreads, we are monitoring the changing environment daily and we are adapting as the situation evolves. We've put in place more stringent operating procedures and safety protocols to help ensure the well-being of our employees, their families, and everyone with whom they interact. We are doing our best to enable social distancing and other safety and cleaning protocols across all functions. And meet our commitments to support consistent community food supplies and the needs of our retail partners. As you would expect all of our corporate and commercial employees who are able to, are working remotely. A big thank you to our IT team who have done an outstanding job making the transition to virtual work as seamless as possible. And also to our HR team for the wealth of resources, they continue to provide our employees to effectively manage work remotely. Currently, all of our manufacturing plants remain open and we continue to operate our supply chain with limited disruption. As the situation began to unfold, we built inventory in both raw materials and finished goods to mitigate risks and to help us to continue meeting demand. This proactive approach coupled with our experienced and dedicated team has enabled us to consistently deliver strong customer service levels. Our first quarter case fill rate was over 98.5% with a 99% case fill rate in March. And despite incremental marketplace challenges in April, our case fill rates remain close to 98%. Utilizing flexible scheduling, the majority of our sales reps remain in stores, partnering with our retailers to provide much needed support. This continued in-store presence, combined with our strong customer service, has driven confectionery share gains of almost 300 basis points during the past month. Our manufacturing and retail employees have shown amazing dedication and resilience and we have implemented incentives to recognize these contributions for employees who can safely work to keep our operations running. We have closed our own retail locations, including our Chocolate World Store in Hershey, Pennsylvania; Times Square, New York; and Las Vegas from most of Q2. While sales in our retail locations are relatively small in proportion to our total business, we do expect several months of closures to have an effect. In addition to our retail stores, there are several other parts of our business that are seeing an outsized impact, including our food service business and our travel retail business, both of which are seeing channel decline of 75% to 80%. And we saw a meaningful category decline in China during a key seasonal gifting window in the first quarter. Combined, these businesses represent approximately 6% of our sales. Now, let me share a little bit about what we're seeing with the consumer as it relates to our core business in the U.S. Pre-COVID-19, our business was tracking in line with expectations with retail takeaway up a little over 2% and confectionery share gains of about 20 basis points. Easter, an NCAA March Madness were sold in and merchandised in store. Our key innovation was largely in markets, including Reese's Take 5 and KitKat Duo and many of our key customers began selling our new thins items before any retail disruption occurred. Similar to many other food manufacturers, we saw a benefit from consumer stock up in March, though to a lesser degree than meal-oriented categories. This was consistent with our expectations and what we typically see with weather-related pantry loading. Total Hershey retail sales growth accelerated to 10% in March. This growth was across all classes of trade, with particular strength in food, mass, and dollar channels. We were in a great position to support this increase foot traffic and demand as we had strong merchandising and ample inventory in stores as we geared up for Easter and our NCAA promotion. We delivered a solid Easter season despite the significant disruptions we saw in both the retail environment and in consumers' lives. Recall we did expect the season to decline versus last year, given Easter was a week earlier this year. Overall, our selling was in line with expectations. Retail takeaway got off to a strong start and sell-through was pacing ahead of expectations heading into the final week. We did, however; see large changes in the macro environment during that final week. This impacted consumer trips and overall category performance and sell-through. Throughout the season, including a difficult final week, our teams executed well. We delivered retail takeaway and sell-through ahead of competition. While our sell through came in slightly below expectations, we expect minimal impact to the P&L or to retail takeaway in the coming weeks. As a reminder, confectionery retail takeaway for the beginning of April is elevated due to the earlier Easter. We anticipate takeaway in the second half of April to be pressured as a result of this shift. Please keep this in mind when you're evaluating retail trends in the next few weeks, particularly as it relates to quantifying any COVID-19 related impacts. Now, let me spend a few minutes discussing some of the changes we are seeing on our everyday performance. As I mentioned, we experienced the lift in March due to consumer stock up. Our grocery and snacks businesses in particular saw increases in both household penetration and basket size. Hershey syrup, baking chips and cocoa all grew approximately 30% during March, and trends have remained strong as families are spending more time together at home baking. Our Skinny Pop and Pirate's Booty businesses grew approximately 20% and gain share. While March trends were strong, the situation has evolved rapidly in April. As a result, we've seen shifting consumer behavior. More regions have been acted shelter-in-place guidelines. Retailers have limited the number of consumers in stores as well as operating hours. And the medical community is recommending individuals wear masks in public and limit grocery store trips unless essential. A significant number of American households are not working and experiencing meaningful financial pressures. All of this has impacted traffic into stores, length of time in stores, and the amount of discretionary goods people are purchasing. While many consumers have shared, how our categories are helping them cope during this time and bond with their families. They\u2019ve also shared how their shopping priorities have changed. Within salty snacks, DSP brands have begun to outperform due to stronger in-stock and merchandising levels. In addition, we've seen a shift to lower price per ounce offerings as many consumers experience financial constraints. As a result, Skinny Pop and Pirate's Booty have experienced share declines and softening performance over the past three to four weeks. For our confectionary business, we've seen declining sales in the convenience class of trade as trips have slowed. This represents approximately 15% of our North American sales. While we still have an opportunity to capture impulse purchases at checkout in other classes of trade, the significant changes we've seen in overall trips and basket size, over the past several weeks has limited the amount of flow back we've seen to other classes of trade. In addition, the government category has been significantly impacted by social distancing. These categories are much more functional than emotional and they've experienced declines of 40 to 50% over the past several weeks. One of these trends that I've just discussed have softened, growth in other areas of our portfolio remain strong. E-commerce growth has accelerated meaningfully, as many of you would expect and have likely observed yourselves, the number of consumers purchasing groceries online has increased significantly over the past several years. Our research indicates that 45% of consumers have used one or more online grocery options in the past four weeks, 23 points of them -- 23% of which use these services for the first time. We\u2019ve seen similar trends for confection with household penetration also doubling over the past month. Consistent with these broader trends, our overall e-commerce growth rate has accelerated significantly with growth over 120% in March versus 60% in January and February. We are seeing growth across fulfillment models and across occasions, including in our Candy Dish offering, seasonal items and our single serve items. At one retailer 80% of the full year digital sales plan was achieved in the month of March alone. In the week leading up to Easter, 43% of Easter sales at this retailer were purchased online. And at another retailer, we were able to make more Easter items available online and shift inventory to maximize sell-through as consumer behaviors changed mid-season. As we've shared in the past, profitability in this key e-commerce segment is relatively in line with total company average margins and that continues to be the case as trends have recently evolved. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends given the strong investment and enhanced capabilities we have implemented over the past several years. Our take-home confection business such as our bags of Kisses and miniatures are growing nicely. Baking chips, cocoa and syrup are also seeing elevated growth as families spend more time together in the kitchen. Throughout this pandemic, our proactive approach with our supply chain is paying dividends. Strong customer service has enabled us to partner with our retailers to consistently capture these consumer opportunities and maintain a strong presence in store. As I mentioned earlier, our case fill rate for the first quarter was very strong and has continued into April, despite the increasingly difficult operating environment. This tremendous work by our manufacturing and sales teams is evident in our recent market share performance. Hershey confectionery category share gains were up over two points in March and are up over three points to-date in April. Now, let me spend a few minutes discussing our international markets. As you all know, these markets represent a smaller percentage of our overall sales, but they're an important growth driver for our business. Whilst, specifics vary by country, we've consistently seen more COVID-19 related pressure in these markets than in the United States. This is driven by several factors, including more restrictions on manufacturing and retail in some countries, as well as less discretionary income, which impacts consumer\u2019s ability to afford non-essential goods like chocolate. Parts of our business continue to perform well, including non-confectionery products like syrup, spreads, and milk. And we're winning confectionery share in the modern trade and e-commerce channel. However, some of our 2020 growth initiatives that focused on increasing geographic and traditional trade distribution have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe there's still tremendous long-term opportunity for us in our international markets, and we're maintaining an appropriate level of investment to capture these opportunities once the situation stabilized. In both our U.S. and international markets, we are actively reevaluating priorities and resourcing to adjust as the situation evolves. Like many companies, we are partnering with our retailers to make sure we have the right level of promotional support during these unique times. Our best-in-class retail sales force is a tremendous asset to help continue executing important promotional programs such as Seasons, S'mores, and Reese's Lovers. We are evaluating our media plan and adjusting both levels of support, messaging and channel when appropriate. For example, we've adjusted our S'mores copy to emphasize family consumption at home versus larger community and friend gatherings. We have taken savings from events like NCAA March Madness and Olympics and reallocated some to digital and our Reese's Lover promotion this summer, while leveraging some of that to cover incremental COVID-19 manufacturing and selling costs. We are proactively planning for Halloween and partnering with our retailers to be prepared for a strong recovery, while also making smart choices to mitigate risk if consumer behavior remains impacted. This includes optimizing our portfolio and price point mix and activation timing, as well as amplifying our e-commerce plan. Our ability to quickly pivot and adapt to the changes, along with our strong balance sheet and cash flow gives us confidence in our ability to manage through these disruptions and emerge stronger. While we are highly focused on managing the pandemic, we are also continuing to advance strategic imperatives that will be critical levers for us to drive the business going forward. We are however, taking a prudent approach and moderating the pace of some of these work streams, so that teams can adequately focus on the situation at hand. Specifically, we've chosen to selectively pause aspects of our ERP project, until all of our functional experts are able to focus on the critical design phase. We will continue to advance the finance and data work stream efforts of our ERP project, while we delay supply chain and order to cash efforts. We expect this to delay our overall implementation by about one year. Given the current demands on our supply chain team, as well as a desire for cash flow flexibility, we've also altered the pacing on our recently announced supply chain project. We do not expect any of these delays to have a material impact on our future growth ambitions, including those we have planned for 2021. Now, before I turn it over to Steve to share details on our Q1 performance, I wanted to take a minute to update you on some strategic choices we are making unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to better prioritize resources against assets that, fit our business model and scale capabilities, we are working to divest our crates, shorts in burger and to global brands. We will share more information regarding these divestitures in the future. It's important to note that our learnings from recent acquisitions have underscored the importance of assets scale and margin profile. We are obsessed with scale assets closer to $100 million, with high margins that enable brand investment to drive growth. These are great brands that continue to resonate with consumers, but they require a different go to market model that we believe is better supported by other owners. These actions will enable us to prioritize our recently acquired scale assets, within salty snacks and nutrition bars. Now, let me turn it over to Steve.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you, Michele, and good morning, everyone. I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and well. I plan to start with highlights from our first quarter results, including the impact from COVID-19 and then pivot to expectations for financial performance moving forward in light of the evolving pandemic. During the first quarter, recorded net sales increased 1% versus the same period last year, with organic constant currency sales growth of 0.5%. This was in line with expectations with only a modest impact from COVID-19. North America organic constant currency sales growth of 1.2% versus prior year was driven by net price realization as expected, a shorter Easter offset solid everyday sales grow by approximately one point in Q1. We did see a larger increase in consumer demand from stock up trips at the end of the quarter with total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway, up over 10% in March. However, this did not materially contribute to net sales growth in the quarter as retailer inventory was depleted to satisfy much of this demand. As we look to the balance of the year, we did not expect COVID-19 to permanently change our base inventory level assumptions. Though, we expect continued volatility and trends over the coming months due to the virus disruptions. The International and other segments reported in organic constant currency sales decline of 5.8% versus the prior year quarter. This was largely attributable to COVID-19 related softness, particularly in China, also included in this segment are, our own retail location, and our travel retail business that Michele mentioned earlier. While these businesses so minimal COVID-19 impact during Q1, we expect a more significant impact in the second quarter, given the shelter in place restrictions that were implemented in late March and early April. Now, turning to profitability for the quarter, our lever for gross margin expansion continue to be effective, with a 90 basis point improvement in the first quarter, increasing adjusted gross margin to 46.6%. Net price realization drove the majority of these gains and in addition to some benefits from productivity, as we proactively built inventory to mitigate risks related to COVID-19, recall, we expect Q1 to be our strongest pricing quarter of the year as we benefited from both the final phase of our July 2018 price increase and the implementation of our July 2019 price increase. Pricing in Q1 was in line with expectation and remains on track for the year. These gross margin games enabled strong investment in our brands and capabilities, selling, marketing and administrative expense increased 4.8% versus prior year, driven by planned elevated advertising level and investments in strategic growth capabilities. Operating expense for capabilities, including our ERP and supply chain program, or slightly ahead of expectations for the quarter due to timing, however, remain on track for the year. Recall, we also increased our incentive program for key levels in our organization in Q4 of 2019. For the full year, there's minimal impact from these changes versus 2019. However, due to the timing of the decision last year, the related incentive expense will be unfavorable in Q1, Q2 and Q3 and favorable in Q4. Adjusted operating profit increased by point 2% in the first quarter versus the prior period, and adjusted operating profit margin came in at 23.1%, reflecting a 20 basis point declines versus the same period last year. Gross margin gains were more than offset by operating expense timing. Adjusted earnings per share diluted were $1.63 for the quarter, an increase of 2.5% versus the same period last year. Continued growth margin strength and favorable tax enabled additional business investment and offset the Easter sales headwind and the International COVID-19 pressures to deliver solid overall earnings growth. Note the favorable tax in Q1 was driven by the tightening of tax credit. And we did not expect material changes to the full year tax outlook we provided in January. Given our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we are confident we will be able to manage through the current crisis, including maintaining strong liquidity. We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our operating, investing and financing needs through operating cash flow, further supported by access to bank lines and commercial paper. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet with $261 million in operating cash flow from the first quarter. We will continue to evaluate the situation moving forward and plan to prioritize cash utilization to meet our liquidity needs. Our strong free cash flow and healthy balance sheet continue to remain a core strength and competitive advantage in these uncertain times. Recall in January, we announced two significant investments for 2020 and 2021, including the ERP transformation and the supply chain capacity and capability initiative. We plan to continue to move these projects forward, as both investments are strategically important for long-term growth. That said, as Michele mentioned, we did pause certain aspects of these projects, and reprioritize other capital projects to enable our teams to focus on the current crisis. This is anticipated to be late our ERP implementation by approximately one year. As a result, we now expect capital spending in 2020 to be approximately $400 million to $450 million, rather than the $500 million we communicated in January. In addition to investing for growth, returning cash to our shareholders remains a key priority now and over our 126 year history. This morning, we announced the second quarter dividend, which is our 362nd consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock. Additionally, the company repurchased $150 million of common stock in the first quarter under the $500 million authorization approved by the Board in July 2018 $260 million remain available for repurchases under this program. We also repurchased $19 million of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options. We remain confident that our capital stewardship and allocation priorities will allow for continued strong and sustainable shareholder return. Let's move now to a discussion of our financial outlook and expectations for the balance of the year. Due to the rapidly evolving situation and the high degree of uncertainty, we do not believe we are able to estimate the full year financial impact with reasonable accuracy, and therefore, believe it is prudent to withdraw our fiscal 2020 full year guidance at this time. As we navigate this dynamic situation, we understand transparency is more important now than ever before. The uncertainty around a few key variables and the subsequent impact these could have to our outlook influenced our decision to withdraw guidance. These variables include the length and severity of the pandemic, the shape and timeline for recovery; the associated impact on retail restrictions both in the U.S. and internationally; the changing consumer behavior from shelter at home restrictions, including potential impacts to participation in key season; and the ability of our supply chain to execute and meet customer and consumer needs. Each of these variables could have significant implications to our growth and profitability. Michele shared with you the trends that are impacting the retail environment and consumer behavior. Some of these sales risks and opportunities also have impacts on profitability, namely risks related to our high margin, instant consumable products, particularly in the convenience class of trade, and our refreshment brands could dilute profitability. The announced compensation program for the manufacturing team along with increased plant sanitation and personal protective equipment, will add approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental costs. However, we are seeing some efficiencies in the plant from running our largest, most efficient SKUs, which is helping to partially offset some of these expenses. Let me now spend a minute on our supply chain productivity initiatives. We had a strong start to productivity in Q1 with over $20 million of savings. However, to enable our teams to focus on COVID-19 priorities, we have deprioritized some planned productivity initiatives worth approximately five to $10 million in Q2. We remain confident in our ability to deliver against our long-term productivity goals. While commodity prices for some of our key ingredients have recently declined, given our hedging program, we expect minimal benefits to 2020. These declines do, however, improve the profile for 2021 versus our outlook in January. Operating expenses are expected to increase approximately $10 million to $15 million as a result of a new incentive program for sales representatives and increased sanitation and personal protective equipment. We anticipate savings related to travel and entertainment, given travel restrictions and social distancing practices to at least partly mitigate these impacts. While we feel there is too much uncertainty at this point to provide a reasonable estimate of the full year financial impact related to COVID-19, we want to provide reassurance that we are being both proactive and agile in managing our performance as the pandemic unfolds. We build inventory in the first quarter to anticipate demand and limit disruptions. We've taken a hard look at capital spending and reprioritize to ensure adequate resources to address both COVID-19 related projects and those critical for strategic growth. We are dynamically adjusting our trade and advertising plan. We are actively monitoring the commodity and financial markets for long-term opportunities. All of these decisions are being made with the priority of ensuring the safety of our employees and communities, while being fully prepared for the recovery. Michele and I could not be prouder of our team for bringing their best every day. This forward leaning, agile mindset, and high performance culture will help us persevere through this crisis and seize opportunities in the recovery. We are confident the uncertainty we face is temporary and then our decisions and adaptive operating model will help us forge relationships with customers and consumers, allowing for sustained long-term growth. Now, let me turn it back to Michele for some closing remarks.\nMichele Buck: Thanks Steve. As we look ahead, we expect the environment to remain volatile as the COVID-19 pandemic and consumers financial security both evolve. But we remain confident in the strength and resiliency of our category and brands over the long-term, and our remarkable leaders and employees who are executing against our strategies, reacting to current changes, and capitalizing on the opportunities that this change presents. The Hershey Company has more than 125 years of experience managing through tough, fast moving, and unprecedented moments in time; two World Wars, economic depressions and recessions, and other momentous events. Each time we plan, we took action, and we learned and adapted. And we kept our focus on making the best decisions for our employees, our partners, our stockholders, our communities, and the consumers that we serve. This moment in time is no different. It calls for us to be our best working together with compassion and understanding to do what's best for our global society. And we believe that this resilience will only make us stronger in the days and the years ahead. Steve, Melissa, and I are now available to take any of your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning, everybody, and hope everyone is doing well. And thanks for a lot of granularity in the prepared remarks.\nMichele Buck: Thanks, Andrew. Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning. I want to start with -- obviously, things are still incredibly fluid and they will remain so for quite some time. And none of us know exactly how or if, you know, ultimately, consumers will alter the way they sort of -- alter the way they celebrate key seasons and things. But you mentioned Michele, a couple of them a couple of actions to sort of mitigate risk or making some smart choices around being able to pivot quickly if there are changes. Adding three of the things you mentioned, were optimizing the portfolio, potentially some changes to net price realization, and activation timing. I was wondering if you could just maybe comment just briefly on each of those. Just want to make sure I have a sense of what are some of the levers you could pull if there are some changes in the way we all think about and celebrate key holidays.\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. So, relative to Halloween, I know that you were asking about -- and there was actually a fourth lever of e commerce. So, let me talk about each of those. So, first of all, we are looking at the portfolio because we have seasonally dressed items for Halloween. We also have in the season, everyday assortment bags that play a key role. So, one area we're looking at is how do we mitigate potential risk of not knowing what consumer behavior will be by really optimizing what's the right balance of seasonal and everyday type items? We're evaluating the price points relative to understanding that some consumers may be financially strapped. How do we look at some of those higher price points and make sure that we have enough entry level price points and that the balance of the portfolio across price points, accounts for the fact that there will be some consumers going through financial pressures. Activation timing is really trying to keep our pulse on -- we know that we can impact these seasons based on when we set the season, we know that consumers will buy a season to bring the product in their house and there's some celebration in the house before the community events of Trick or Treat. And so leaning in a little bit earlier on some of the timing is a very reasonable option that we're discussing with our retail partners to be able to capture more celebration outside of just the Trick or Treat occasion. And then lastly, we are seeing e-commerce really dial up in Easter we saw that and so we are increasing our investments and activity to really have a great presence in Halloween, the right portfolio, bundled solutions across the needs for Halloween. So, those are really the key actions there.\nAndrew Lazar: That's very helpful. And then just follow-up, I think you mentioned the number of 6% of sales was for food service, some of the retail locations, and I wasn't clear, does that include also China or was China separate from that number?\nMichele Buck: Yes. No, that includes China and also our world travel retail business, which of those stores that -- product we sell in duty-free stores in airport.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much. Hope everyone stays well.\nMichele Buck: Thank you. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thank you for the question. I appreciate it. I guess -- there is a lot to cover here. Let me ask about 2Q. Is your visibility better for 2Q than it is for the rest of the year? And can you give us -- maybe Steve, some of the puts and takes here. The gross margin benefit you've got in the first quarter, does that come out of 2Q. And then secondly, the retail sales growth as measured by Nielsen was really high, much higher than your shipments. And is there any timing impact with respect to 2Q like will that come back at all or is that just Easter being a week earlier. Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Hey, Rob, let me start by addressing some of that. So, first of all, I would say we do have greater visibility to Q2 because we're already halfway into the quarter. So we do have stronger visibility there. As you may recall, we had planned for a difficult Q2 prior to COVID as a result of some of our year-on-year lapse. And then our decision to close our retail locations for most of the second quarter, that's a known that's within our control. Certainly the impacts that we're seeing with restaurants closed in the second quarter that's a known that we can see the known impact on food service, the reduction in flights, we can see that that's a known relative to travel retail and then we also had some elements of cost that are knowns which include manufacturing and retail incentives, one-time costs on PPE and safety protocols. So, we do have a lot of visibility around those things. Relative to the kind of the gap or the disconnect in Q1 between retail and shipment, let me address that and then I'm going to let Steve make some other comments about Q2. If you look at Q1, you can really break up that differential with about half the differential with retail being ahead of shipments was driven by Easter. As you know, we always have Easter in Q1, but the amount of Easter that gets consumed in Q1 is all dependent on the timing of the Easter holiday. This year, Easter was a bit earlier than last year and therefore, much more of the season was actually consumed, taken away in Q1 versus last year. The other half of the differential in the retail sales to shipments, part of it is innovation. We shipped Take 5 and Kit Kat Duos in December to set up for strong merchandising in Q1. So, you got shipments in December, you got the takeaway in Q1, and then the other component is some inventory.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes and I want to add, of a good complete answer. We have good visibility into the costs I think for Q2 and Michele went through most of the things like the incentives and the sanitation are well known and we talked about those in the prepared remarks. The productivity piece, the 20 that we saved in Q1 doesn't come or doesn't go away in Q2, but we would have expected to add to that, and you need to grow and that's the piece that won't happen that we had in the plan. And then maybe the third piece that we touched on a little bit sort of implied as we talked about the top line as there is probably going to be some negative mix impact coming through, again, thinking about refreshment in convenience store impacts in the total mix. And that's probably a $5 million to $10 million gross profit impact for the year.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. I do have a follow-up. You mentioned your in-store execution and your sales incentives as a way to maybe mitigate some of the category declines and take share. But are some of your retail partners, limiting the amount of people that will allow in the stores, just for social distancing reasons and does that impact your execution at all?\nMichele Buck: So, some of course are, but as we've worked out with our retail sales reps and partnered closely with retailers, even before that we had worked with them with a lot of our partners to have our team go in during off hours to try and bring our product and set displays when they're either work consumers in the store or at the very lowest periods of time. So, I would say, well, there is some impact. I would say, largely we've partnered really closely with retailers to work around that, both in terms of the safety and social distancing of our employees as well as helping the retailers to kind of protect and manage the number of people in their store. But largely, they've been really supportive and appreciative of the extra help which they desperately need obviously as consumers are purchasing a lot.\nRobert Moskow: Got it. Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Driscoll with DD Research. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Driscoll: Great. Thank you and good morning.\nMichele Buck: Hey David. Good to hear from you.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nDavid Driscoll: What a pleasure, thank you. Good to be here. So, let me follow-up on Rob's, because I -- while I think you guys gave a good list of things in 2Q. Maybe there is some numbers that you gave that I feel like were annual like the PPE expense, the personal protective equipment and then something specific to the second quarter. So, I'm just a little confused on what expenses were allocating to the second quarter that you know of right now versus the sales side. And then can I can I just follow-up on this. I mean you've said it I think twice now, but I still think I'm not clear, it sounds like there are some -- there is at least one positive with how the retailer inventories ended at the end of the first quarter. And I think you said in the script that you haven't made any changes to your retailer inventory assumptions. So, that sounds like there is going to be a recovery of those retailer inventories in 2Q, which would be favorable to sales. So, again if you -- I apologize here, I do appreciate you've said this, but are you saying that Q2 sales are maybe a little bit better than expected versus where you previously had it, but on the expense side, that's significantly more negative because of the PPE costs, the incentive costs. And then there is I think a couple of other items that you wanted to call out right there in 2Q that we're hitting it the mix. Sorry. Appreciate it. The mix to what's going on in the business? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yes, David. The large majority of the cost increases really do hit in Q2. If you think about the biggest pieces of that the manufacturing and retail incentives, one-time costs around PP&E, the pull back on productivity was around Q2, there is some mix impact with the pressure around refreshment and C-store. And so if you look at that, by far the biggest impact is in Q2. Some of the PP&E and safety will continue throughout the year. And then there are some potential offsets, less travel that will have the benefit of throughout the year. We continue to kind of look at trade in DME optimization. There could be commodities, but not a large number. And as it relates to the inventory, I think, my gut would be that at some point we get a little bit of that back, but we don't know for sure and we definitely don't know that it will be in Q2. In fact, if I was just looking at what's going on in the world right now and at retail, my gut would be that likely wouldn't be in Q2, but instead, would be some point later in the year.\nDavid Driscoll: All right. That color is really helpful. Just one follow-up from me. I don't think you said how your China business was performing in April. Is there any insight we can gain right there? Are you seeing any sign of recovery? I mean a nearly 50% decline in that business in Q1 is really large. So, is there any color you can give us on how 2Q might shape up for Hershey China?\nMichele Buck: Yes, I mean it's better than we anticipated. It's better than we saw in February, but it's clearly in a ramp-up recovery. So, it's not close to back to normal yet. But we are watching that on to leverage any insights and I think the biggest insight there is just the move from offline to online is very real, it's continued and just like we think it will here in the U.S.\nDavid Driscoll: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Good morning. Thank you. My first question is, is there anything you can do to protect yourself right now, whether it's buying product ahead of time or potentially considering diversifying your geographic sourcing. Because there is obviously Western Africa has not been hit very hard by COVID yet. There have been some suggestions that maybe it will get hit harder later in this year. What are your concerns about that? Just given how much cocoa you source from one region and, again, what can you do to maybe mitigate some of those concerns, potentially?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, right now our supply chain team has done a fantastic job and so aside from cocoa some of our more specialty small ingredients even certainly in the first quarter as COVID starting to get traction they bought some of those ahead to get ahead of it. Right now, I think we feel pretty strong about our cocoa supply, I can tell you our procurement team is very deep into that market on a good day, and they are even deeper here in looking at alternative suppliers and so. So, far harvest looks strong and we don't see anything in the medium term, that causes a lot of concern on cocoa supply.\nMichele Buck: Yes, what we need for the year, like those quantities are already here. So, they're out of that region. So, as we look at this year, we're in good shape and that gives us time and we're working closely with those governments as well. Obviously, this is important crop for that geography and we're working closely with them to make sure that they are set up to handle it.\nKen Goldman: Okay. Thank you for that. And then one quick follow-up. Thank you for the color on what's in the 6% number in terms of branded stores and World Travel locations and so forth. One question that I was asked, I wasn't sure how to answer was, how big our movie theaters, sporting events, things that maybe are not captured in Nielsen, first of all, is that in that 6% number as well and second, can you give us any kind of any kind of rough size for what you would think those types of channels might be. I know I'm being vague with the question there.\nMichele Buck: No, that's okay. Some of that falls into our broader specialty business and that might be another 2% to 3% of sales again some impact.\nKen Goldman: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Hi. So, again focusing on the trends that you're seeing in Q2 now that the doctor settled on the panic-buying phase. Could you give us by channel, how things are looking. So for example, how big are you overall in e-commerce and how quickly is that growing right now and it's not different from the past. The C-store channel I think you mentioned that was about 15% of sale how soft is that right now? And we assume that the food service in China that 6% of the business as well down at the moment. And then also taking a look at it by product type, if you think about import versus seasonal versus every day, how fast are each of those growing or shrinking if I imagine some of the maybe relative to what you would normally expect? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Okay. Let me do my best on that one to try a great set out. So, C-store is about 15% of our sales. It's declining about 10%. E-commerce is about 2% of our sales and we're seeing the growth rate double there. Now, of course, that's just what we've seen recently. So, all of these are the recent trends. So, of course, I can't predict exactly how that will play forward. Walmart and mass channels and dollar stores, grocery have had pretty good trends as people are really shopping there. They are frequenting those places and also all of those places tend to have or many of them and e-commerce leg that's being leveraged. I'd tell you the other place we are seeing some softness is around drug. So, drug and C-store are the two channels that I think we've seen the biggest softness, plus there were initial huge stock-ups of the initial stock up behavior with huge at clubs, that's moderated a bit. Melissa might have to come back and give you maybe more of the details around the specifics on each piece of trade. But I would say C-store is 15% and drug in that probably 8% range of our total business, and those are the places that are most pressured and then, of course, the rest kind of fall in the middle. If we look at take impulse, take-home and seasonal clearly the softness on impulse is a little bit less than you see in terms of the 10% decline in C-store, because we do still have business coming through, food, drug and mass, so less than that 10%. Take-home obviously driving our growth and seasons we had a really good Easter. So, at this point, what we're gearing up to do is to -- we met our expectations, our sell-in, our net sales shipments, we fell just short on takeaway. So, seasons, I call kind of a wash and then take-home is where we're seeing the strength. But Melissa can give you more details I think offline on that.\nAlexia Howard: Perfect. And then a super quick follow-up. I think you said that Easter was down as expected, because of the shorter season, but it was also a bit weaker than expected, presumably because of the pandemic. Is that the way that we should be thinking about it?\nMichele Buck: The sell-in was on expectation. The sell-through was -- yes, was a little bit weaker than we anticipated. Really strong sell-through up until the final week. The final week of Easter happened at the same week that the government started to recommend the consumer is not going to grocery stores, unless it was essential and many of the big retailers started limiting the number of consumers they would allow in their store at one time. And we saw a direct impact on that, on that last week of Easter. But basically that will not cause that softness in the sell-through in the last week really shouldn't impact the P&L.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. Thank you so very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. Good morning everyone.\nMichele Buck: Hi Bryan.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: So, I had a question just on -- just one question around the end of line manufacturing flexibility you have with packaging. And I guess my question is around, if we're looking going forward at a scenario where it's more e-commerce, which is, it's sort of a different type -- it requires a different type of packaging, maybe more grocery and mass more at home less convenience and gas. And then also maybe needing packaging flexibility to address affordability, maybe different pack sizes or different types. Do you feel like with the investments you've made in recent years that you have the flexibility to sort of make those shifts and be able to kind of service if that's where the business SKUs over the next six to nine months?\nMichele Buck: Yes, I would say, largely, we have flexibility in our manufacturing. I mean we already have a portfolio of products that we're meeting e-commerce demand and that demand has been across every pack type whether it's candy dish, whether it is instant consumables, et cetera, we already have a multitude of pack sizes that we've always done. This is a category that that lives on many different pack types for many different occasions. And then certainly as we're doing some of our supply chain work going forward, one of our goals is to put an even more automation to hopefully improve margins as we do that, but we are well set up to be able to adapt to different packs and sizes right now.\nBryan Spillane: And if I could just one follow-up to that is, we've seen in other categories where retailers are kind of narrowing SKUs, want to be in stock, with the highest-velocity SKUs. Have you seen any of that yet in your categories?\nMichele Buck: Yes, we are. And we think we're well positioned there. As you know, we had just gone through a big SKU rationalization program to get rid of some of the smaller SKUs and on the normal course of business, as we grow our business, we have all of our SKUs categorized with the very highest movers, there is a must haves, must be protected at all cost and then we kind of go through our portfolio. So, we've always managed our business in that way. So, we've been well set up to serve in that priority environment.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Thanks Michele.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJason English: Hey. Good morning. Thank you for sliding me in. I guess I'll pick up on one thread from Mr. Spillane in terms of e-com. As we think about maybe what could be different in 2021 assuming all these issues come to pass. The amount of sales going to e-com sounds like it could be the one durable change. So, quick question, just to get a little more context around it. And I guess what really my angle here is to understand the impact on your impulse oriented sales. I think historically you've said about a 30 year portfolio is impulse and you're saying today 15% of that's going through C-store. How much of that is going through food, drug, and mass?\nMichele Buck: I mean the other -- that would be the other 15%, basically the other between the difference between 33% and 15%, I would say, largely. Let me just think about--\nJason English: And there is a little bit of lending in there too I think.\nMichele Buck: Yes, that's what I was trying to think how much would be in those specialty channels spending would be the biggest piece of that. We have some in Club as well in terms of reseller packs at Sam's. I mean, I guess I would estimate, I'm going to say may be 15% maybe fundraising Lending Club and specialty are 5%, so I'd say maybe 15% goes through drug and mass.\nJason English: And how is that 15% tracking today?\nMichele Buck: It's tracking much better than the C-store. It really varies by channel. The drug piece would be the softest piece because overall drug is just not getting as much traffic. I think a lot of people are using drive through all options; people are trying to stay away from smaller stores. So, the larger majority of that is really going through mass and grocery. It's still softer than take-home, but it is still growing in some of our retailers.\nJason English: Okay. So, is that sort of reflective of what life looks like in the lower trip frequency environment and people stick with the sort of online replenishment and trip frequency is lower. Do you think it's reasonable to assume that if there is risk to like lost business that can be a bit more durable? That's the risk. So, we're talking about a couple of points of sales which may -- that may not come back. And is there anything else that you would highlight that we should be cognizant of as we think about the impact to your earnings power in 2021 or beyond?\nMichele Buck: Yes, I mean I think with less trips, certainly there is some risk there and that creates some of -- some bit of a mix and sales risks. However, I guess the other thing I'd ask you to think about is, as we look at our e-commerce business, we have instant consumable strength in e-commerce. So, one of our biggest selling items has been instant consumable, both singles, as well as we sell case packs that have maybe 24 instant consumable items in them. And given that our margins are strong, we don't really discount and bulk the instant consumable items. Driving the growth there, our goal there is to continue to drive the growth there which offsets how the consumer behavior is evolving and changing. I think the other opportunity is really for us to just kind of drive against kind of the push that as consumers have less trips they're also executing bigger baskets and so really focusing on that as an opportunity as well.\nJason English: Yes, got it. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. Stay safe, be well.\nMichele Buck: Thank you. You too.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Hi, great. Thank you so much. So, just sort of question on pricing, I mean it seems like you're saying the last week pre-Easter weakness really shouldn't impact the P&L in the near-term. Maybe that suggests that the promotional plans have really been altered, but then I think it also sounded like, you said promotional spend could be increasing your price mix sharpened as you go through the year, right, to maybe increased demand overall, but then I also heard that maybe you're pricing plans remain on track. So, obviously, there are just a number of comments in there. I just wanted to clarify. Just in general pricing environment and we've heard Easter didn't go so well seasonally let's say in Europe, but obviously because the COVID buying, right, you kind of mask some of that seasonal weakness is there too much product still on the seasonal based on the shelf does that have to be sold through sounds like inventory levels have come down, but pricing sounds to be okay. So, any commentary you can just give kind of around the overall pricing dynamic will be great. Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Yes, I guess, first I'd start by saying, we feel good about our pricing strategy for the year and our current initiatives are on track and we really don't expect any material changes as a result of COVID. So, we were expecting in that two to two and half points of pricing in 2020 and we continue to believe that, that will be the case. As we look at promotional spending, at this point in time in our category a lot of our promotional spending is utilized to drive display. So, we are unlike some other categories that are less impulsive where people use price to have a temporary price reduction and really low pantry. That's not really how our category works. So, given our retail sales team is out there in force, we're continuing to get display. And so we aren't seeing a big pullback. There could be some small coupled -- couple of million dollars that come back from trade, but I think in general, we're continuing to drive against that. And then really relative to the -- we're just trying to be sensitive to the consumer environment around the financial constraints which is one reason that we continue to believe some of our promotional support makes sense than the display. And then during the holidays just making sure we have the right array of price point. So, I don't think about that as being an absolute reduction in price, because that's really not about the price realization per pack, it's just more what is the absolute price point. So, that consumers have options if they want to buy multiple or a bigger pack, they can and if they're going to buy less, so that's less kind of about the price per pound. Does that answer your question?\nRob Dickerson: Yes. No, that's actually very helpful. I mean it sounds like basically if there is somewhat of a mix shift -- you talk about mix in terms of margin and time to make some pack size, et cetera, could affect pricing. But it sounds like maybe you could offset some of that with potential reduced promotional spend and display, so kind of net-net, at this point you feel like we're kind of okay. Does that make sense, back to you.\nMichele Buck: Yes, I would say net-net, we think we're okay, yes.\nRob Dickerson: Okay, cool. And then just quickly and more broadly look over time, we've heard a number of larger food companies have said they actually do better online, but their online share can actually be better just given page one display and overall brand awareness. Obviously, there is a whole conversation around the channel shift. If we just think about online specifically in all the other channels, would you just say yes, we think, given our investment brand awareness, what have you. If we do shift into more than online purchase society over the next few years that we should be taking more share of category. That's it. Thanks a lot.\nMichele Buck: Sure. Yes, I mean we feel good about our ability to drive the business and capture share online. We're looking at total online share is a little difficult because there are a lot of unique businesses that have direct to consumer businesses online. But if we look at kind of the big retailers and the pure play big retailers in that space, yes, I feel pretty good that that we should be able to continue to drive share there.\nRob Dickerson: Thank you, Michele. Stay safe.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Please proceed with your question.\nNik Modi: Yes, good morning everyone. Michele, the share gains look really healthy and obviously you indicated they accelerated. So, I'm just wondering, what do you think is driving that? Is it a function of just the fact that your fill rates were so good? So, you have the product available. We are hearing about one of your major competitors of scaling back on some of the SKU count. So, I'm just curious what you're seeing and what you would attribute some of that market share gain to?\nMichele Buck: Yes, I would absolutely attribute it to our customer service levels. So we've been able to maintain incredibly high customer service levels at that 98%, 98.5%, 99% depending on the month. I think within that we have had very good availability across our portfolio. So, we've been pretty much able to meet the specific product demands as well. So, huge kudos and credit to our manufacturing team who has just done an outstanding job of being ahead of this, building inventory ahead of this, getting raw materials in ahead of this, working with their teams and all of our manufacturing employees who supported doing this. And then I would also say having our retail sales reps out there building displays, stocking shelves, that has also been a very positive impact. So, yes, I would say a lot of it is about the strength of our company in the past has always been a lot around operational excellence and execution, and I think that's really benefiting us on top of course the fact that we feel great about the brands and the programs we've had out there, but I do think that's been a difference maker.\nNik Modi: And just going back to the question, any changes in the competitive landscape. We are hearing again, one of your major competitors is looking to do their own SKU rationalization program. So, I'm just curious if you've seen that in the marketplace or if you've heard the same?\nMichele Buck: No, I mean, I'd say the only -- we've probably heard similar things as you had regarding a couple of competitors in the category, who may have supply, not a solid position on supply.\nNik Modi: Great. And then just quickly on the size of SKU. So, if you think about a lot of the volume that was probably sold over the past several weeks, my suspicion is and maybe you can confirm that it was all large bags multi-packs. Just curious how you guys are thinking about at home inventory depletions just given general consumer behavior. I mean, my sense is, it's going to take some time for them to work that inventory down. But just love your thoughts on that. I could be wrong.\nMichele Buck: Yes, I mean, obviously, we didn't get as big of a stock up as like say some of the main meal categories. So, I don't think that that there is a huge backlog. But certainly as we get through the quarter, that will be something that we will learn more about. We do know that the things that are selling best or things that are around take-home occasions, snack size assortment bags, six packs of Hershey Bars for people to make S'mores at home. Twizzlers which one of the key uses for Twizzlers is when you're watching movies or TV, so I think we know which items are getting consumed the most rapidly. And like I said, we don't have a huge stockpile, but that is something that will play out in Q2 and we'll get a better feel for how quickly people utilize those. We also, know, hey, they are baking a lot at home and so there are other indulgent categories that we're competing with for those usage occasions at home.\nNik Modi: Great. Thanks a lot. Stay healthy.\nMichele Buck: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Growe: Hi. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Hi.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nChris Growe: Hi. I just had two questions, if I could. I was curious first of all, Michele if you could speak to your thought here, the concept of the thought around guidance. And it sounds like and I'm taking good notes, and there's a lot of little factors you've given around the second quarter, but you seem to have pretty good -- a pretty good visibility into that quarter. Is there a factor too that worried you about giving guidance for the upcoming quarter or having a good read on the quarter given you seem to have good visibility across a number of different areas of the other P&L?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So, as we mentioned, we do have a lot of visibility into Q2 of some of the things that we know will hit us. We mentioned the 6% of the business, a lot of those businesses essentially being closed or down based on governmental regulations. We certainly know that we've got in that $45 million of cost that will hit in Q2. If you add up manufacturing and retail productivity some of those elements, so we do have that at the same time, we still don't know how the rest of the quarter will play out and we're seeing that every single week we get new pieces of news or information that make it difficult to know if something else is coming our way. And certainly, then I think as we look to the rest of the year, we have significantly less visibility there. We certainly have tried to share what we think the biggest risks and opportunities are in the portfolio. The opportunities we're driving at, how we're managing against the risks, but much less visibility there. So, yes, I would say that's where we kind of stand.\nChris Growe: Okay. And then I just was curious, a quick question about your international business. Obviously, China has gotten better rather still down as you noted. Are the -- the other countries, in India, Brazil and Mexico, just a bigger risk of declines is that one area of uncertainty you have also in the second quarter?\nMichele Buck: Yes, international is definitely an area that remains a risk. Each country, each area is in a different state in the growth or stage of the pandemic and each government is acting quite differently. So, we have some markets like Mexico or India, India is really on a lockdown for four weeks. We have some of those markets where it's difficult for our employees to actually get to work, based on what's happening with public transportation, based on government regulations about people in certain areas, not traveling to other areas. So, we are facing a lot in those markets. And I'd say that's really primarily in Mexico and India as the two biggest impacts. But yes, it is in that camp of more uncertain at this point in time.\nChris Growe: Just one final point on that. Is it likely that the international business could be weaker in Q2 than it was in Q1 even though you don't have that unique China experience?\nMichele Buck: Yes, I would say there is a lot of uncertainty in international such that I'm not really sure that I could say for sure how that's going to play out. I think that's one of the uncertainties for Q2.\nChris Growe: Okay, that's fine. I appreciate it. And again stay safe. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: With the heavy traffic at retail are you -- what adjustments are you making if any to promotional spending? And if there is any change in plans or those things that can drive savings or is it just shifting timing to a different point in the year?\nMichele Buck: Yes, we haven't made a lot of big wholesale changes in promotions, because our promotions are really geared against display, because our retail sales teams are still out there and are able to build those displays and obviously there remains a lot of space in stores given outages in certain categories. We continue to be focused on making sure that we are really driving as much of our spending as possible to display any place that we didn't have any kind of temporary price reduction. We are trying to pull back on those and then certainly we are trying to gear the spending around the right programs that are relevant at this point in time. So, we continue to look at where we are there. We continue to partner with retailers in terms of how we meet their needs. At this point in time, I would say we are largely executing according to our plans for the year, but always looking if there is opportunity where promotions aren't going to make sense. They aren't going to drive consumers like a temporary price reduction. I don't think, well, how we convert that more to a display driving initiative or use it for something else.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, that's helpful. And then you talked about it a lot of the puts and takes on the cost side and specifically a lot of cost headwinds that are more 2Q focused. You also have some of the marketing savings you mentioned and efficiencies from the bigger SKUs running to the extent that it goes both ways on the full year how does it net out? Is it a net negative or is it about a push, how do you see assuming just at least what you know now?\nMichele Buck: Are you saying a net negative or a push on total cost impact to the business?\nMichael Lavery: Exactly, yes.\nMichele Buck: Steve, do you want to talk to that?\nSteve Voskuil: The cost impact on a full year basis will be a net negative. I think we're not giving guidance for the full year until all of the other puts and takes on the variables that we're watching will come into play. Obviously, depending on the shape of the recovery, we would expect to see improvement in those costs, after we get past the challenge in Q2. But I don't think there is enough new savings to offset some of the deeper incremental costs we are going to face in Q2.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks. And just a last quick one on the Hershey World Stores, how much seasonality is there to that with the percentage of sales in Q2 and 3Q typically be much higher?\nMichele Buck: So, it depends on the location. Clearly for the Hershey-based store, there is big seasonality in the summer, because we are right outside Hershey Park. So, that one is highly seasonal. Las Vegas, I would say not so much and Time Square has a bit of a SKU to summer and to holiday because it's driven by that traffic, but not quite as much of a seasonal SKU.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] It will come from the line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Hey, thanks for taking the question. I guess if we just wrap all this up, I mean before we -- before this the COVID-19 situation, I'll started we were looking forward to an Investor Day update from you in March, which seems like a long, long time ago. But as you think back and think about what you intend to communicate that day, how much of the content that you feel would remain unchanged as it relates to your medium to long-term strategy at this point versus what degree do you think we're all going through now is likely to have lasting impacts on Hershey's future playbook?\nMichele Buck: I don't think that what we are going through right now would have any impact on that content on our long-term strategies. What I would say is, some of it may shift a bit. So, certainly, I think there has been a step change in e-commerce that just now occurred that probably would have taken longer to occur in society around consumers' adoption of e-commerce around retailers' readiness. It would be smaller things like that, but largely our strategies remain unchanged. Our big initiatives in terms of what we think is important remain unchanged as well.\nSteve Powers: Okay. And I guess maybe just a quick follow-up. I can tie it to your comments that you made today on the plans to divest the businesses that you highlighted. I guess how much -- was that a March communication or is that a decision that you've definitively come to more recently. It feels just a little bit surprising in the context of what were all -- what were in the midst of. So, I just wanted some clarity there as you -- I mean obviously you've made comments about this business in the past, but with the X now intend--?\nMichele Buck: That was pre-COVID. That's been under way. It has been Q1, late Q4, probably started in Q4 or early Q1 activity to explore and to begin that work.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, I'd say we're always looking at everything in the portfolio, testing where its best place is and so no COVID impact on that.\nSteve Powers: Okay. And is there any way you can dimension the size 2019 sales profitability of those businesses, just for some frame of reference?\nMichele Buck: I mean they're small.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, they are small.\nSteve Powers: Okay, fair enough. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Poole for any final comments.\nMelissa Poole: Thank you all for joining us this morning. I'm sure there are still additional questions, I'll be around all day to answer as many of them as I can. Thanks so much. Stay wealthy -- stay healthy.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Voskuil",
            "content": "Thank you, Michele, and good morning, everyone. I hope you, your families and colleagues are safe and well. I plan to start with highlights from our first quarter results, including the impact from COVID-19 and then pivot to expectations for financial performance moving forward in light of the evolving pandemic. During the first quarter, recorded net sales increased 1% versus the same period last year, with organic constant currency sales growth of 0.5%. This was in line with expectations with only a modest impact from COVID-19. North America organic constant currency sales growth of 1.2% versus prior year was driven by net price realization as expected, a shorter Easter offset solid everyday sales grow by approximately one point in Q1. We did see a larger increase in consumer demand from stock up trips at the end of the quarter with total Hershey U.S. retail takeaway, up over 10% in March. However, this did not materially contribute to net sales growth in the quarter as retailer inventory was depleted to satisfy much of this demand. As we look to the balance of the year, we did not expect COVID-19 to permanently change our base inventory level assumptions. Though, we expect continued volatility and trends over the coming months due to the virus disruptions. The International and other segments reported in organic constant currency sales decline of 5.8% versus the prior year quarter. This was largely attributable to COVID-19 related softness, particularly in China, also included in this segment are, our own retail location, and our travel retail business that Michele mentioned earlier. While these businesses so minimal COVID-19 impact during Q1, we expect a more significant impact in the second quarter, given the shelter in place restrictions that were implemented in late March and early April. Now, turning to profitability for the quarter, our lever for gross margin expansion continue to be effective, with a 90 basis point improvement in the first quarter, increasing adjusted gross margin to 46.6%. Net price realization drove the majority of these gains and in addition to some benefits from productivity, as we proactively built inventory to mitigate risks related to COVID-19, recall, we expect Q1 to be our strongest pricing quarter of the year as we benefited from both the final phase of our July 2018 price increase and the implementation of our July 2019 price increase. Pricing in Q1 was in line with expectation and remains on track for the year. These gross margin games enabled strong investment in our brands and capabilities, selling, marketing and administrative expense increased 4.8% versus prior year, driven by planned elevated advertising level and investments in strategic growth capabilities. Operating expense for capabilities, including our ERP and supply chain program, or slightly ahead of expectations for the quarter due to timing, however, remain on track for the year. Recall, we also increased our incentive program for key levels in our organization in Q4 of 2019. For the full year, there's minimal impact from these changes versus 2019. However, due to the timing of the decision last year, the related incentive expense will be unfavorable in Q1, Q2 and Q3 and favorable in Q4. Adjusted operating profit increased by point 2% in the first quarter versus the prior period, and adjusted operating profit margin came in at 23.1%, reflecting a 20 basis point declines versus the same period last year. Gross margin gains were more than offset by operating expense timing. Adjusted earnings per share diluted were $1.63 for the quarter, an increase of 2.5% versus the same period last year. Continued growth margin strength and favorable tax enabled additional business investment and offset the Easter sales headwind and the International COVID-19 pressures to deliver solid overall earnings growth. Note the favorable tax in Q1 was driven by the tightening of tax credit. And we did not expect material changes to the full year tax outlook we provided in January. Given our strong cash flow and balance sheet, we are confident we will be able to manage through the current crisis, including maintaining strong liquidity. We believe we have adequate liquidity to meet our operating, investing and financing needs through operating cash flow, further supported by access to bank lines and commercial paper. At the end of the first quarter, we had approximately $1.1 billion in cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet with $261 million in operating cash flow from the first quarter. We will continue to evaluate the situation moving forward and plan to prioritize cash utilization to meet our liquidity needs. Our strong free cash flow and healthy balance sheet continue to remain a core strength and competitive advantage in these uncertain times. Recall in January, we announced two significant investments for 2020 and 2021, including the ERP transformation and the supply chain capacity and capability initiative. We plan to continue to move these projects forward, as both investments are strategically important for long-term growth. That said, as Michele mentioned, we did pause certain aspects of these projects, and reprioritize other capital projects to enable our teams to focus on the current crisis. This is anticipated to be late our ERP implementation by approximately one year. As a result, we now expect capital spending in 2020 to be approximately $400 million to $450 million, rather than the $500 million we communicated in January. In addition to investing for growth, returning cash to our shareholders remains a key priority now and over our 126 year history. This morning, we announced the second quarter dividend, which is our 362nd consecutive quarterly dividend on the common stock. Additionally, the company repurchased $150 million of common stock in the first quarter under the $500 million authorization approved by the Board in July 2018 $260 million remain available for repurchases under this program. We also repurchased $19 million of common stock in connection with the exercise of stock options. We remain confident that our capital stewardship and allocation priorities will allow for continued strong and sustainable shareholder return. Let's move now to a discussion of our financial outlook and expectations for the balance of the year. Due to the rapidly evolving situation and the high degree of uncertainty, we do not believe we are able to estimate the full year financial impact with reasonable accuracy, and therefore, believe it is prudent to withdraw our fiscal 2020 full year guidance at this time. As we navigate this dynamic situation, we understand transparency is more important now than ever before. The uncertainty around a few key variables and the subsequent impact these could have to our outlook influenced our decision to withdraw guidance. These variables include the length and severity of the pandemic, the shape and timeline for recovery; the associated impact on retail restrictions both in the U.S. and internationally; the changing consumer behavior from shelter at home restrictions, including potential impacts to participation in key season; and the ability of our supply chain to execute and meet customer and consumer needs. Each of these variables could have significant implications to our growth and profitability. Michele shared with you the trends that are impacting the retail environment and consumer behavior. Some of these sales risks and opportunities also have impacts on profitability, namely risks related to our high margin, instant consumable products, particularly in the convenience class of trade, and our refreshment brands could dilute profitability. The announced compensation program for the manufacturing team along with increased plant sanitation and personal protective equipment, will add approximately $25 million to $30 million of incremental costs. However, we are seeing some efficiencies in the plant from running our largest, most efficient SKUs, which is helping to partially offset some of these expenses. Let me now spend a minute on our supply chain productivity initiatives. We had a strong start to productivity in Q1 with over $20 million of savings. However, to enable our teams to focus on COVID-19 priorities, we have deprioritized some planned productivity initiatives worth approximately five to $10 million in Q2. We remain confident in our ability to deliver against our long-term productivity goals. While commodity prices for some of our key ingredients have recently declined, given our hedging program, we expect minimal benefits to 2020. These declines do, however, improve the profile for 2021 versus our outlook in January. Operating expenses are expected to increase approximately $10 million to $15 million as a result of a new incentive program for sales representatives and increased sanitation and personal protective equipment. We anticipate savings related to travel and entertainment, given travel restrictions and social distancing practices to at least partly mitigate these impacts. While we feel there is too much uncertainty at this point to provide a reasonable estimate of the full year financial impact related to COVID-19, we want to provide reassurance that we are being both proactive and agile in managing our performance as the pandemic unfolds. We build inventory in the first quarter to anticipate demand and limit disruptions. We've taken a hard look at capital spending and reprioritize to ensure adequate resources to address both COVID-19 related projects and those critical for strategic growth. We are dynamically adjusting our trade and advertising plan. We are actively monitoring the commodity and financial markets for long-term opportunities. All of these decisions are being made with the priority of ensuring the safety of our employees and communities, while being fully prepared for the recovery. Michele and I could not be prouder of our team for bringing their best every day. This forward leaning, agile mindset, and high performance culture will help us persevere through this crisis and seize opportunities in the recovery. We are confident the uncertainty we face is temporary and then our decisions and adaptive operating model will help us forge relationships with customers and consumers, allowing for sustained long-term growth. Now, let me turn it back to Michele for some closing remarks. Thank you. Yes and I want to add, of a good complete answer. We have good visibility into the costs I think for Q2 and Michele went through most of the things like the incentives and the sanitation are well known and we talked about those in the prepared remarks. The productivity piece, the 20 that we saved in Q1 doesn't come or doesn't go away in Q2, but we would have expected to add to that, and you need to grow and that's the piece that won't happen that we had in the plan. And then maybe the third piece that we touched on a little bit sort of implied as we talked about the top line as there is probably going to be some negative mix impact coming through, again, thinking about refreshment in convenience store impacts in the total mix. And that's probably a $5 million to $10 million gross profit impact for the year. Good morning. Yes, right now our supply chain team has done a fantastic job and so aside from cocoa some of our more specialty small ingredients even certainly in the first quarter as COVID starting to get traction they bought some of those ahead to get ahead of it. Right now, I think we feel pretty strong about our cocoa supply, I can tell you our procurement team is very deep into that market on a good day, and they are even deeper here in looking at alternative suppliers and so. So, far harvest looks strong and we don't see anything in the medium term, that causes a lot of concern on cocoa supply. Good morning. Good morning Bryan. Good morning. Good morning. The cost impact on a full year basis will be a net negative. I think we're not giving guidance for the full year until all of the other puts and takes on the variables that we're watching will come into play. Obviously, depending on the shape of the recovery, we would expect to see improvement in those costs, after we get past the challenge in Q2. But I don't think there is enough new savings to offset some of the deeper incremental costs we are going to face in Q2. Yes, I'd say we're always looking at everything in the portfolio, testing where its best place is and so no COVID impact on that. Yes, they are small."

            "content": "Thank you, Melissa. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I hope, first of all, that you and your loved ones are safe and healthy. We are all experiencing an unparalleled and rapidly evolving global pandemic. Our thoughts go out to those that have been impacted and we'd like to extend our sincere thank you to all of the heroes working to keep people safe during this difficult time. As you all know, food companies play an important role during this crisis, helping to ensure a steady food supply and supporting local economy. We recognized that Hershey is not only a food manufacturer, but also an important link in the broader food supply chain, particularly with farmers and other raw material suppliers that rely on us. I could not be more proud of The Hershey team and how they are responding to this situation, first and foremost, with the care and support they are showing for each other, their families, partners, and communities. But also with their relentless energy and passion to continue to safely operate with excellence. I'd like to extend a heartfelt thank you to all of them, especially to those in our manufacturing plants and those working at retail to make moments of goodness for our consumers during these difficult times. The situation continues to evolve so rapidly that it's difficult to predict the future with much certainty. While comparisons can certainly be drawn to weather related disruptions or natural disasters or recessions, the reality is that we have never seen so many factors at play at the same time on such a global scale. But we are committed to being transparent about what we are seeing in the marketplace and what we are doing to respond. We will continue to be forthcoming as we navigate this uncharted territory and we believe we will have more visibility in the coming months as the situation stabilizes. Let me start by saying pre-COVID-19, our business was on track versus our expectations, both in Q1 and our outlook for the full year. Now, let me share some details around what we are doing from an operations perspective, before I discuss what we are seeing in terms of consumer behavior. The health and safety of our Hershey team remains paramount in our decision-making and action. Food safety has always been at the center of our day-to-day operations, and that will continue. As the pandemic spreads, we are monitoring the changing environment daily and we are adapting as the situation evolves. We've put in place more stringent operating procedures and safety protocols to help ensure the well-being of our employees, their families, and everyone with whom they interact. We are doing our best to enable social distancing and other safety and cleaning protocols across all functions. And meet our commitments to support consistent community food supplies and the needs of our retail partners. As you would expect all of our corporate and commercial employees who are able to, are working remotely. A big thank you to our IT team who have done an outstanding job making the transition to virtual work as seamless as possible. And also to our HR team for the wealth of resources, they continue to provide our employees to effectively manage work remotely. Currently, all of our manufacturing plants remain open and we continue to operate our supply chain with limited disruption. As the situation began to unfold, we built inventory in both raw materials and finished goods to mitigate risks and to help us to continue meeting demand. This proactive approach coupled with our experienced and dedicated team has enabled us to consistently deliver strong customer service levels. Our first quarter case fill rate was over 98.5% with a 99% case fill rate in March. And despite incremental marketplace challenges in April, our case fill rates remain close to 98%. Utilizing flexible scheduling, the majority of our sales reps remain in stores, partnering with our retailers to provide much needed support. This continued in-store presence, combined with our strong customer service, has driven confectionery share gains of almost 300 basis points during the past month. Our manufacturing and retail employees have shown amazing dedication and resilience and we have implemented incentives to recognize these contributions for employees who can safely work to keep our operations running. We have closed our own retail locations, including our Chocolate World Store in Hershey, Pennsylvania; Times Square, New York; and Las Vegas from most of Q2. While sales in our retail locations are relatively small in proportion to our total business, we do expect several months of closures to have an effect. In addition to our retail stores, there are several other parts of our business that are seeing an outsized impact, including our food service business and our travel retail business, both of which are seeing channel decline of 75% to 80%. And we saw a meaningful category decline in China during a key seasonal gifting window in the first quarter. Combined, these businesses represent approximately 6% of our sales. Now, let me share a little bit about what we're seeing with the consumer as it relates to our core business in the U.S. Pre-COVID-19, our business was tracking in line with expectations with retail takeaway up a little over 2% and confectionery share gains of about 20 basis points. Easter, an NCAA March Madness were sold in and merchandised in store. Our key innovation was largely in markets, including Reese's Take 5 and KitKat Duo and many of our key customers began selling our new thins items before any retail disruption occurred. Similar to many other food manufacturers, we saw a benefit from consumer stock up in March, though to a lesser degree than meal-oriented categories. This was consistent with our expectations and what we typically see with weather-related pantry loading. Total Hershey retail sales growth accelerated to 10% in March. This growth was across all classes of trade, with particular strength in food, mass, and dollar channels. We were in a great position to support this increase foot traffic and demand as we had strong merchandising and ample inventory in stores as we geared up for Easter and our NCAA promotion. We delivered a solid Easter season despite the significant disruptions we saw in both the retail environment and in consumers' lives. Recall we did expect the season to decline versus last year, given Easter was a week earlier this year. Overall, our selling was in line with expectations. Retail takeaway got off to a strong start and sell-through was pacing ahead of expectations heading into the final week. We did, however; see large changes in the macro environment during that final week. This impacted consumer trips and overall category performance and sell-through. Throughout the season, including a difficult final week, our teams executed well. We delivered retail takeaway and sell-through ahead of competition. While our sell through came in slightly below expectations, we expect minimal impact to the P&L or to retail takeaway in the coming weeks. As a reminder, confectionery retail takeaway for the beginning of April is elevated due to the earlier Easter. We anticipate takeaway in the second half of April to be pressured as a result of this shift. Please keep this in mind when you're evaluating retail trends in the next few weeks, particularly as it relates to quantifying any COVID-19 related impacts. Now, let me spend a few minutes discussing some of the changes we are seeing on our everyday performance. As I mentioned, we experienced the lift in March due to consumer stock up. Our grocery and snacks businesses in particular saw increases in both household penetration and basket size. Hershey syrup, baking chips and cocoa all grew approximately 30% during March, and trends have remained strong as families are spending more time together at home baking. Our Skinny Pop and Pirate's Booty businesses grew approximately 20% and gain share. While March trends were strong, the situation has evolved rapidly in April. As a result, we've seen shifting consumer behavior. More regions have been acted shelter-in-place guidelines. Retailers have limited the number of consumers in stores as well as operating hours. And the medical community is recommending individuals wear masks in public and limit grocery store trips unless essential. A significant number of American households are not working and experiencing meaningful financial pressures. All of this has impacted traffic into stores, length of time in stores, and the amount of discretionary goods people are purchasing. While many consumers have shared, how our categories are helping them cope during this time and bond with their families. They've also shared how their shopping priorities have changed. Within salty snacks, DSP brands have begun to outperform due to stronger in-stock and merchandising levels. In addition, we've seen a shift to lower price per ounce offerings as many consumers experience financial constraints. As a result, Skinny Pop and Pirate's Booty have experienced share declines and softening performance over the past three to four weeks. For our confectionary business, we've seen declining sales in the convenience class of trade as trips have slowed. This represents approximately 15% of our North American sales. While we still have an opportunity to capture impulse purchases at checkout in other classes of trade, the significant changes we've seen in overall trips and basket size, over the past several weeks has limited the amount of flow back we've seen to other classes of trade. In addition, the government category has been significantly impacted by social distancing. These categories are much more functional than emotional and they've experienced declines of 40 to 50% over the past several weeks. One of these trends that I've just discussed have softened, growth in other areas of our portfolio remain strong. E-commerce growth has accelerated meaningfully, as many of you would expect and have likely observed yourselves, the number of consumers purchasing groceries online has increased significantly over the past several years. Our research indicates that 45% of consumers have used one or more online grocery options in the past four weeks, 23 points of them -- 23% of which use these services for the first time. We've seen similar trends for confection with household penetration also doubling over the past month. Consistent with these broader trends, our overall e-commerce growth rate has accelerated significantly with growth over 120% in March versus 60% in January and February. We are seeing growth across fulfillment models and across occasions, including in our Candy Dish offering, seasonal items and our single serve items. At one retailer 80% of the full year digital sales plan was achieved in the month of March alone. In the week leading up to Easter, 43% of Easter sales at this retailer were purchased online. And at another retailer, we were able to make more Easter items available online and shift inventory to maximize sell-through as consumer behaviors changed mid-season. As we've shared in the past, profitability in this key e-commerce segment is relatively in line with total company average margins and that continues to be the case as trends have recently evolved. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on these trends given the strong investment and enhanced capabilities we have implemented over the past several years. Our take-home confection business such as our bags of Kisses and miniatures are growing nicely. Baking chips, cocoa and syrup are also seeing elevated growth as families spend more time together in the kitchen. Throughout this pandemic, our proactive approach with our supply chain is paying dividends. Strong customer service has enabled us to partner with our retailers to consistently capture these consumer opportunities and maintain a strong presence in store. As I mentioned earlier, our case fill rate for the first quarter was very strong and has continued into April, despite the increasingly difficult operating environment. This tremendous work by our manufacturing and sales teams is evident in our recent market share performance. Hershey confectionery category share gains were up over two points in March and are up over three points to-date in April. Now, let me spend a few minutes discussing our international markets. As you all know, these markets represent a smaller percentage of our overall sales, but they're an important growth driver for our business. Whilst, specifics vary by country, we've consistently seen more COVID-19 related pressure in these markets than in the United States. This is driven by several factors, including more restrictions on manufacturing and retail in some countries, as well as less discretionary income, which impacts consumer's ability to afford non-essential goods like chocolate. Parts of our business continue to perform well, including non-confectionery products like syrup, spreads, and milk. And we're winning confectionery share in the modern trade and e-commerce channel. However, some of our 2020 growth initiatives that focused on increasing geographic and traditional trade distribution have been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe there's still tremendous long-term opportunity for us in our international markets, and we're maintaining an appropriate level of investment to capture these opportunities once the situation stabilized. In both our U.S. and international markets, we are actively reevaluating priorities and resourcing to adjust as the situation evolves. Like many companies, we are partnering with our retailers to make sure we have the right level of promotional support during these unique times. Our best-in-class retail sales force is a tremendous asset to help continue executing important promotional programs such as Seasons, S'mores, and Reese's Lovers. We are evaluating our media plan and adjusting both levels of support, messaging and channel when appropriate. For example, we've adjusted our S'mores copy to emphasize family consumption at home versus larger community and friend gatherings. We have taken savings from events like NCAA March Madness and Olympics and reallocated some to digital and our Reese's Lover promotion this summer, while leveraging some of that to cover incremental COVID-19 manufacturing and selling costs. We are proactively planning for Halloween and partnering with our retailers to be prepared for a strong recovery, while also making smart choices to mitigate risk if consumer behavior remains impacted. This includes optimizing our portfolio and price point mix and activation timing, as well as amplifying our e-commerce plan. Our ability to quickly pivot and adapt to the changes, along with our strong balance sheet and cash flow gives us confidence in our ability to manage through these disruptions and emerge stronger. While we are highly focused on managing the pandemic, we are also continuing to advance strategic imperatives that will be critical levers for us to drive the business going forward. We are however, taking a prudent approach and moderating the pace of some of these work streams, so that teams can adequately focus on the situation at hand. Specifically, we've chosen to selectively pause aspects of our ERP project, until all of our functional experts are able to focus on the critical design phase. We will continue to advance the finance and data work stream efforts of our ERP project, while we delay supply chain and order to cash efforts. We expect this to delay our overall implementation by about one year. Given the current demands on our supply chain team, as well as a desire for cash flow flexibility, we've also altered the pacing on our recently announced supply chain project. We do not expect any of these delays to have a material impact on our future growth ambitions, including those we have planned for 2021. Now, before I turn it over to Steve to share details on our Q1 performance, I wanted to take a minute to update you on some strategic choices we are making unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic. In order to better prioritize resources against assets that, fit our business model and scale capabilities, we are working to divest our crates, shorts in burger and to global brands. We will share more information regarding these divestitures in the future. It's important to note that our learnings from recent acquisitions have underscored the importance of assets scale and margin profile. We are obsessed with scale assets closer to $100 million, with high margins that enable brand investment to drive growth. These are great brands that continue to resonate with consumers, but they require a different go to market model that we believe is better supported by other owners. These actions will enable us to prioritize our recently acquired scale assets, within salty snacks and nutrition bars. Now, let me turn it over to Steve. Thanks Steve. As we look ahead, we expect the environment to remain volatile as the COVID-19 pandemic and consumers financial security both evolve. But we remain confident in the strength and resiliency of our category and brands over the long-term, and our remarkable leaders and employees who are executing against our strategies, reacting to current changes, and capitalizing on the opportunities that this change presents. The Hershey Company has more than 125 years of experience managing through tough, fast moving, and unprecedented moments in time; two World Wars, economic depressions and recessions, and other momentous events. Each time we plan, we took action, and we learned and adapted. And we kept our focus on making the best decisions for our employees, our partners, our stockholders, our communities, and the consumers that we serve. This moment in time is no different. It calls for us to be our best working together with compassion and understanding to do what's best for our global society. And we believe that this resilience will only make us stronger in the days and the years ahead. Steve, Melissa, and I are now available to take any of your questions. Thanks, Andrew. Good morning. Yes, absolutely. So, relative to Halloween, I know that you were asking about -- and there was actually a fourth lever of e commerce. So, let me talk about each of those. So, first of all, we are looking at the portfolio because we have seasonally dressed items for Halloween. We also have in the season, everyday assortment bags that play a key role. So, one area we're looking at is how do we mitigate potential risk of not knowing what consumer behavior will be by really optimizing what's the right balance of seasonal and everyday type items? We're evaluating the price points relative to understanding that some consumers may be financially strapped. How do we look at some of those higher price points and make sure that we have enough entry level price points and that the balance of the portfolio across price points, accounts for the fact that there will be some consumers going through financial pressures. Activation timing is really trying to keep our pulse on -- we know that we can impact these seasons based on when we set the season, we know that consumers will buy a season to bring the product in their house and there's some celebration in the house before the community events of Trick or Treat. And so leaning in a little bit earlier on some of the timing is a very reasonable option that we're discussing with our retail partners to be able to capture more celebration outside of just the Trick or Treat occasion. And then lastly, we are seeing e-commerce really dial up in Easter we saw that and so we are increasing our investments and activity to really have a great presence in Halloween, the right portfolio, bundled solutions across the needs for Halloween. So, those are really the key actions there. Yes. No, that includes China and also our world travel retail business, which of those stores that -- product we sell in duty-free stores in airport. Thank you. Thank you. Hey, Rob, let me start by addressing some of that. So, first of all, I would say we do have greater visibility to Q2 because we're already halfway into the quarter. So we do have stronger visibility there. As you may recall, we had planned for a difficult Q2 prior to COVID as a result of some of our year-on-year lapse. And then our decision to close our retail locations for most of the second quarter, that's a known that's within our control. Certainly the impacts that we're seeing with restaurants closed in the second quarter that's a known that we can see the known impact on food service, the reduction in flights, we can see that that's a known relative to travel retail and then we also had some elements of cost that are knowns which include manufacturing and retail incentives, one-time costs on PPE and safety protocols. So, we do have a lot of visibility around those things. Relative to the kind of the gap or the disconnect in Q1 between retail and shipment, let me address that and then I'm going to let Steve make some other comments about Q2. If you look at Q1, you can really break up that differential with about half the differential with retail being ahead of shipments was driven by Easter. As you know, we always have Easter in Q1, but the amount of Easter that gets consumed in Q1 is all dependent on the timing of the Easter holiday. This year, Easter was a bit earlier than last year and therefore, much more of the season was actually consumed, taken away in Q1 versus last year. The other half of the differential in the retail sales to shipments, part of it is innovation. We shipped Take 5 and Kit Kat Duos in December to set up for strong merchandising in Q1. So, you got shipments in December, you got the takeaway in Q1, and then the other component is some inventory. So, some of course are, but as we've worked out with our retail sales reps and partnered closely with retailers, even before that we had worked with them with a lot of our partners to have our team go in during off hours to try and bring our product and set displays when they're either work consumers in the store or at the very lowest periods of time. So, I would say, well, there is some impact. I would say, largely we've partnered really closely with retailers to work around that, both in terms of the safety and social distancing of our employees as well as helping the retailers to kind of protect and manage the number of people in their store. But largely, they've been really supportive and appreciative of the extra help which they desperately need obviously as consumers are purchasing a lot. Hey David. Good to hear from you. Yes, David. The large majority of the cost increases really do hit in Q2. If you think about the biggest pieces of that the manufacturing and retail incentives, one-time costs around PP&E, the pull back on productivity was around Q2, there is some mix impact with the pressure around refreshment and C-store. And so if you look at that, by far the biggest impact is in Q2. Some of the PP&E and safety will continue throughout the year. And then there are some potential offsets, less travel that will have the benefit of throughout the year. We continue to kind of look at trade in DME optimization. There could be commodities, but not a large number. And as it relates to the inventory, I think, my gut would be that at some point we get a little bit of that back, but we don't know for sure and we definitely don't know that it will be in Q2. In fact, if I was just looking at what's going on in the world right now and at retail, my gut would be that likely wouldn't be in Q2, but instead, would be some point later in the year. Yes, I mean it's better than we anticipated. It's better than we saw in February, but it's clearly in a ramp-up recovery. So, it's not close to back to normal yet. But we are watching that on to leverage any insights and I think the biggest insight there is just the move from offline to online is very real, it's continued and just like we think it will here in the U.S. Yes, what we need for the year, like those quantities are already here. So, they're out of that region. So, as we look at this year, we're in good shape and that gives us time and we're working closely with those governments as well. Obviously, this is important crop for that geography and we're working closely with them to make sure that they are set up to handle it. No, that's okay. Some of that falls into our broader specialty business and that might be another 2% to 3% of sales again some impact. Good morning. Okay. Let me do my best on that one to try a great set out. So, C-store is about 15% of our sales. It's declining about 10%. E-commerce is about 2% of our sales and we're seeing the growth rate double there. Now, of course, that's just what we've seen recently. So, all of these are the recent trends. So, of course, I can't predict exactly how that will play forward. Walmart and mass channels and dollar stores, grocery have had pretty good trends as people are really shopping there. They are frequenting those places and also all of those places tend to have or many of them and e-commerce leg that's being leveraged. I'd tell you the other place we are seeing some softness is around drug. So, drug and C-store are the two channels that I think we've seen the biggest softness, plus there were initial huge stock-ups of the initial stock up behavior with huge at clubs, that's moderated a bit. Melissa might have to come back and give you maybe more of the details around the specifics on each piece of trade. But I would say C-store is 15% and drug in that probably 8% range of our total business, and those are the places that are most pressured and then, of course, the rest kind of fall in the middle. If we look at take impulse, take-home and seasonal clearly the softness on impulse is a little bit less than you see in terms of the 10% decline in C-store, because we do still have business coming through, food, drug and mass, so less than that 10%. Take-home obviously driving our growth and seasons we had a really good Easter. So, at this point, what we're gearing up to do is to -- we met our expectations, our sell-in, our net sales shipments, we fell just short on takeaway. So, seasons, I call kind of a wash and then take-home is where we're seeing the strength. But Melissa can give you more details I think offline on that. The sell-in was on expectation. The sell-through was -- yes, was a little bit weaker than we anticipated. Really strong sell-through up until the final week. The final week of Easter happened at the same week that the government started to recommend the consumer is not going to grocery stores, unless it was essential and many of the big retailers started limiting the number of consumers they would allow in their store at one time. And we saw a direct impact on that, on that last week of Easter. But basically that will not cause that softness in the sell-through in the last week really shouldn't impact the P&L. Hi Bryan. Yes, I would say, largely, we have flexibility in our manufacturing. I mean we already have a portfolio of products that we're meeting e-commerce demand and that demand has been across every pack type whether it's candy dish, whether it is instant consumables, et cetera, we already have a multitude of pack sizes that we've always done. This is a category that that lives on many different pack types for many different occasions. And then certainly as we're doing some of our supply chain work going forward, one of our goals is to put an even more automation to hopefully improve margins as we do that, but we are well set up to be able to adapt to different packs and sizes right now. Yes, we are. And we think we're well positioned there. As you know, we had just gone through a big SKU rationalization program to get rid of some of the smaller SKUs and on the normal course of business, as we grow our business, we have all of our SKUs categorized with the very highest movers, there is a must haves, must be protected at all cost and then we kind of go through our portfolio. So, we've always managed our business in that way. So, we've been well set up to serve in that priority environment. I mean the other -- that would be the other 15%, basically the other between the difference between 33% and 15%, I would say, largely. Let me just think about-- Yes, that's what I was trying to think how much would be in those specialty channels spending would be the biggest piece of that. We have some in Club as well in terms of reseller packs at Sam's. I mean, I guess I would estimate, I'm going to say may be 15% maybe fundraising Lending Club and specialty are 5%, so I'd say maybe 15% goes through drug and mass. It's tracking much better than the C-store. It really varies by channel. The drug piece would be the softest piece because overall drug is just not getting as much traffic. I think a lot of people are using drive through all options; people are trying to stay away from smaller stores. So, the larger majority of that is really going through mass and grocery. It's still softer than take-home, but it is still growing in some of our retailers. Yes, I mean I think with less trips, certainly there is some risk there and that creates some of -- some bit of a mix and sales risks. However, I guess the other thing I'd ask you to think about is, as we look at our e-commerce business, we have instant consumable strength in e-commerce. So, one of our biggest selling items has been instant consumable, both singles, as well as we sell case packs that have maybe 24 instant consumable items in them. And given that our margins are strong, we don't really discount and bulk the instant consumable items. Driving the growth there, our goal there is to continue to drive the growth there which offsets how the consumer behavior is evolving and changing. I think the other opportunity is really for us to just kind of drive against kind of the push that as consumers have less trips they're also executing bigger baskets and so really focusing on that as an opportunity as well. Thank you. You too. Yes, I guess, first I'd start by saying, we feel good about our pricing strategy for the year and our current initiatives are on track and we really don't expect any material changes as a result of COVID. So, we were expecting in that two to two and half points of pricing in 2020 and we continue to believe that, that will be the case. As we look at promotional spending, at this point in time in our category a lot of our promotional spending is utilized to drive display. So, we are unlike some other categories that are less impulsive where people use price to have a temporary price reduction and really low pantry. That's not really how our category works. So, given our retail sales team is out there in force, we're continuing to get display. And so we aren't seeing a big pullback. There could be some small coupled -- couple of million dollars that come back from trade, but I think in general, we're continuing to drive against that. And then really relative to the -- we're just trying to be sensitive to the consumer environment around the financial constraints which is one reason that we continue to believe some of our promotional support makes sense than the display. And then during the holidays just making sure we have the right array of price point. So, I don't think about that as being an absolute reduction in price, because that's really not about the price realization per pack, it's just more what is the absolute price point. So, that consumers have options if they want to buy multiple or a bigger pack, they can and if they're going to buy less, so that's less kind of about the price per pound. Does that answer your question? Yes, I would say net-net, we think we're okay, yes. Sure. Yes, I mean we feel good about our ability to drive the business and capture share online. We're looking at total online share is a little difficult because there are a lot of unique businesses that have direct to consumer businesses online. But if we look at kind of the big retailers and the pure play big retailers in that space, yes, I feel pretty good that that we should be able to continue to drive share there. Yes, I would absolutely attribute it to our customer service levels. So we've been able to maintain incredibly high customer service levels at that 98%, 98.5%, 99% depending on the month. I think within that we have had very good availability across our portfolio. So, we've been pretty much able to meet the specific product demands as well. So, huge kudos and credit to our manufacturing team who has just done an outstanding job of being ahead of this, building inventory ahead of this, getting raw materials in ahead of this, working with their teams and all of our manufacturing employees who supported doing this. And then I would also say having our retail sales reps out there building displays, stocking shelves, that has also been a very positive impact. So, yes, I would say a lot of it is about the strength of our company in the past has always been a lot around operational excellence and execution, and I think that's really benefiting us on top of course the fact that we feel great about the brands and the programs we've had out there, but I do think that's been a difference maker. No, I mean, I'd say the only -- we've probably heard similar things as you had regarding a couple of competitors in the category, who may have supply, not a solid position on supply. Yes, I mean, obviously, we didn't get as big of a stock up as like say some of the main meal categories. So, I don't think that that there is a huge backlog. But certainly as we get through the quarter, that will be something that we will learn more about. We do know that the things that are selling best or things that are around take-home occasions, snack size assortment bags, six packs of Hershey Bars for people to make S'mores at home. Twizzlers which one of the key uses for Twizzlers is when you're watching movies or TV, so I think we know which items are getting consumed the most rapidly. And like I said, we don't have a huge stockpile, but that is something that will play out in Q2 and we'll get a better feel for how quickly people utilize those. We also, know, hey, they are baking a lot at home and so there are other indulgent categories that we're competing with for those usage occasions at home. Thank you. Hi. Yes. So, as we mentioned, we do have a lot of visibility into Q2 of some of the things that we know will hit us. We mentioned the 6% of the business, a lot of those businesses essentially being closed or down based on governmental regulations. We certainly know that we've got in that $45 million of cost that will hit in Q2. If you add up manufacturing and retail productivity some of those elements, so we do have that at the same time, we still don't know how the rest of the quarter will play out and we're seeing that every single week we get new pieces of news or information that make it difficult to know if something else is coming our way. And certainly, then I think as we look to the rest of the year, we have significantly less visibility there. We certainly have tried to share what we think the biggest risks and opportunities are in the portfolio. The opportunities we're driving at, how we're managing against the risks, but much less visibility there. So, yes, I would say that's where we kind of stand. Yes, international is definitely an area that remains a risk. Each country, each area is in a different state in the growth or stage of the pandemic and each government is acting quite differently. So, we have some markets like Mexico or India, India is really on a lockdown for four weeks. We have some of those markets where it's difficult for our employees to actually get to work, based on what's happening with public transportation, based on government regulations about people in certain areas, not traveling to other areas. So, we are facing a lot in those markets. And I'd say that's really primarily in Mexico and India as the two biggest impacts. But yes, it is in that camp of more uncertain at this point in time. Yes, I would say there is a lot of uncertainty in international such that I'm not really sure that I could say for sure how that's going to play out. I think that's one of the uncertainties for Q2. Good morning. Yes, we haven't made a lot of big wholesale changes in promotions, because our promotions are really geared against display, because our retail sales teams are still out there and are able to build those displays and obviously there remains a lot of space in stores given outages in certain categories. We continue to be focused on making sure that we are really driving as much of our spending as possible to display any place that we didn't have any kind of temporary price reduction. We are trying to pull back on those and then certainly we are trying to gear the spending around the right programs that are relevant at this point in time. So, we continue to look at where we are there. We continue to partner with retailers in terms of how we meet their needs. At this point in time, I would say we are largely executing according to our plans for the year, but always looking if there is opportunity where promotions aren't going to make sense. They aren't going to drive consumers like a temporary price reduction. I don't think, well, how we convert that more to a display driving initiative or use it for something else. Are you saying a net negative or a push on total cost impact to the business? Steve, do you want to talk to that? So, it depends on the location. Clearly for the Hershey-based store, there is big seasonality in the summer, because we are right outside Hershey Park. So, that one is highly seasonal. Las Vegas, I would say not so much and Time Square has a bit of a SKU to summer and to holiday because it's driven by that traffic, but not quite as much of a seasonal SKU. I don't think that what we are going through right now would have any impact on that content on our long-term strategies. What I would say is, some of it may shift a bit. So, certainly, I think there has been a step change in e-commerce that just now occurred that probably would have taken longer to occur in society around consumers' adoption of e-commerce around retailers' readiness. It would be smaller things like that, but largely our strategies remain unchanged. Our big initiatives in terms of what we think is important remain unchanged as well. That was pre-COVID. That's been under way. It has been Q1, late Q4, probably started in Q4 or early Q1 activity to explore and to begin that work. I mean they're small."

With that, I will turn it over to the Operator for the first question. Operator At this time we will be conducting a question-and-answer session.\nOperator: Our first question is from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning, Andrew.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Hi there. I guess my question is it seems like the plan of this year is, is Hershey\u2019s going to look to certainly leverage greater SG&A to more than offset some of the expected gross margin pressure during the year. I guess my question is how does the company balance sort of leaning more heavily on SG&A this year to hit certain targets, including less aggressive marketing spend, albeit in light of capacity constraints? How do you balance that with continuing to lean in on reinvestment to protect as much of the sort of the current momentum and the market share that\u2019s been gained in the last two years, really to benefit the outyears, right, of \u201923, \u201924 and sort of beyond?\nMichele Buck: As you know, we take a pretty balanced approach in terms of focus on delivering the short term as well as making sure that we are building all the capabilities and continued investment to build the long term. So, as it relates to\u2014let me start with some of our SG&A. We think it\u2019s important to continue to build capabilities. Some of the places that we have been very focused are in the areas of ERP, obviously, so that we can really get a solid foundation of technology that we think will bring us tremendous benefit going forward in the future. We incur a lot of the expense now, and frankly, more of the benefit in the future. Also, in terms of digital as a big investment area, specifically we\u2019ve had a big focus in advancing our capabilities to deliver more sophisticated targeting and get more efficiency in media. So we believe some of those lean-ins are really important to help us build those capabilities for the future. As we look at brand investment, as you know we are big believers in our business model that brand investment is key. We have always been very solid spenders, and we continue to believe that. We have moderated some of that spending as we\u2019ve had supply challenges and constraints to make sure that we keep our very strong returns on that investment, so it\u2019s a balancing act. Some of the investments in media have enabled us to get to efficiency so that we are still delivering a pretty strong number of consumer impressions out there. We feel good about where our share of voice is. So, we\u2019re really trying to balance that and say, \u201cOkay, we\u2019ll moderate a bit now in brand investment,\u201d but certainly keep our eye on it as we go forward to make sure that we continue to protect that for the long term.\nAndrew Lazar: Right. Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Steve, do you have anything to add to that?\nSteve Voskuil: No, I think you hit the highlights. We have a compensation reset that happens as we set new targets, and so that gives us a little bit on benefits side to deploy against the things that Michele said.\nAndrew Lazar: Right. Then just briefly, Steve, I guess where you say Hershey is right now with respect to sort of retail inventory levels and I guess finished goods inventory as well, relative to where the company might typically see itself sort of at this time of the year? Just trying to get a sense of what sort of inventory refill opportunity there might be moving forward, obviously as capacity allows. Thanks so much.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. As we formed our guidance for next year, we have an assumption inside there that there is an opportunity for some inventory build back into the network. Of course, we\u2019ve also got some inventory building to do on our side, but from a retail distributor standpoint as well and that\u2019s part of our guidance.\nAndrew Lazar: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thank you for the question. I wanted to get a sense of what you\u2019re seeing from competition. Is your competition facing the same supply chain constraints that you\u2019re facing, and therefore, should we assume that you\u2019re expecting a year of market share gains? Or do you expect to hold share this year? Do you expect them to reduce media as well?\nMichele Buck: Relative to the competition, yes, we would say everyone in the category seems to be having similar challenges, just as I would say pretty broadly in the industry that\u2019s the case. We anticipate the situation relative to delivering on demand to be about comparable across the competitors. Relative to market share, we believe that we will hold share this year. As you know, we\u2019ve had some really significant gains over the past two-year period of time. We will have more tepid share performance in the first half of the year, building to a bit more strength in the second half due to laps alone. And relative to share of voice on advertising, we do track that and we feel really good about where we are from an advertising share of voice perspective.\nRobert Moskow: Okay, great. Maybe a follow-up. Gross profit dollars, for the core business, not including the acquisitions, should we still assume that your gross profit dollars are growing? This is kind of a backhanded way to figure out what kind of gross margin I should expect for 2022.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. Gross margin dollars are going to grow. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, from a margin standpoint we expect there to be some dilution comparable to what we saw in \u201921. But from a dollars standpoint, yes, up year-over-year.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. All right, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nNik Modi: Thank you. Good morning everyone. Just a housekeeping item and then just a broader question. I was hoping you could maybe just aggregate the shipping days and the elasticity impact that you discussed in the prepared remarks, if there\u2019s any perspective you can give on the magnitude of each. Then, in the prepared remarks you also indicated you\u2019re looking at historical elasticities when you think about this year, but as we\u2019ve seen across the broader CPG landscape elasticities have been better than expected, so I\u2019m just trying to get clarification. Are you assuming kind of what you\u2019ve seen historically, like pre-COVID? Or if you could just provide some context there.\nMichele Buck: Let me start and answer your elasticity question. I\u2019ll give it to Steve to do the disaggregation. Nik, what we are assuming for this year is historical elasticities. To date on our pricing we have seen a little bit better performance versus historical. As we go into this year, we want to carefully keep our eye on the potential impact of broad inflation on the consumer. We know that there\u2019s been reduction, obviously, in government stimulus and SNAP, and with the inflation across the board it\u2019s just a top of mind watch out area for us, and that\u2019s why we really chose to say historical price elasticities is what we think is a smart and prudent planning move for us. Steve, do you want to talk about disaggregation?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. Just to break that out a little bit, the shipping days we would estimate to be about a 2 point impact on the quarter. And from an elasticity standpoint, if you kind of took that to the side, if you took the shipping days to the side, pounds were about flat in the quarter, if that helps give you some idea.\nNik Modi: That\u2019s very helpful. Then, Michele, just one more question. Obviously the issue with out-of-stocks has been a pervasive problem for everyone and labor obviously is a big part of that. Is this one of those scenarios where you just kind of have to manage through it and don\u2019t really have a good handle on when things are going to start getting better? I mean, I guess because it\u2019s so labor dependent.\nMichele Buck: Well, I guess what I would say is we have a lot of actions in place to drive continuous improvement relative to our own supply. So certainly yes, there is no certain end state where I can tell you this is where the switch flips. But what I can tell you is we have had numerous programs underway. So first of all we focused a lot on optimizing demand. How do we get the most efficiency out of the capacity we have? By reducing complexity in changeovers, prioritizing SKUs, part of that included working with retailers to double and triple face our core items, which is always a great move because they are very high velocity so that makes a lot of sense. As it comes to supply, we are continuing to invest in incremental capacity. There is incremental capacity that will gradually come online as we go through this year and also into 2023 and 2024. We\u2019ve also made some significant investments in manufacturing labor. Frankly, last year was a real challenge. Our people did real yeoman\u2019s work to just do whatever was needed to produce as much volume as possible, but it really wasn\u2019t sustainable in terms of having a reasonable employee value proposition for those folks. And so we have invested in labor. We won\u2019t get the benefit of that immediately because it takes time to train people, to get them up to speed, to be as efficient as our current workforce, but we do think it\u2019s important and a lot of that really just helps us to manage some of the overtime as well. So, we do have a lot of activities underway. We think that we will make continuous improvement, but under no circumstances would we really be out of the woods totally; we will continue to have pressure throughout the year. Our goal is just to continue to make improvements.\nNik Modi: Okay. Thanks much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJason English: Good morning, folks. Thanks for slotting me in.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nJason English: Congrats on strong results and some sustained momentum. The cumulative volume growth in North America over the past two years of, at my calculation roughly 7%, it\u2019s obviously a real stand-out here, especially given that it contrasts to what was very little growth before COVID. My question is kind of on that focus. How much of the volume that you picked up during COVID do you think is durable? How much is at risk of leaking back out as we kind of come out the other side of this? What\u2019s embedded in your planning assumptions? I know there\u2019s a lot there and it\u2019s a bit tricky to unravel, but I would love your view on it.\nMichele Buck: We\u2019ve really tried to do a good dissection and deep dive to understand that as best possible, and I would tell you I think there are a number of things going on. First of all, we do know that there are some COVID related impacts. The change in consumer behaviors with consumers spending more time at home has clearly benefited some of our brands and categories because they\u2019re around their homes more to consume our products, and our products are more eaten in those types of environment than out and about restaurant environments, et cetera. I think that based on what we\u2019re seeing in consumer behavior, I think that while more people \u2013 and people have become more mobile, there also is a change of behavior that I think is here to stay to some degree, right? People enjoy spending time with their families. They appreciate them more given the COVID situation. They\u2019ve gotten comfortable, some of them, the portion who are flexibly working and want to continue some of that. So I believe that some of that is here to stay. At the same time, we also did implement a number of new strategies in our business over the years that we think have also helped us. We really tried to do a better job of balancing innovation and the core to get more sustainable growth. And we have seen that, that had an impact on the business. I think we also think we\u2019ve gotten smarter about pricing, where we have multiple levers on list price and price pack architecture that we can utilize. So I guess I\u2019d tell you, we believe that there\u2019s part of both of that. So we do think that there is a sustainability and underlying sustainability, may not be all of it. But in addition to us, in particular, I think the category\u2019s relevancy has just increased during COVID. So those are some of our thoughts, Rob, I hope that\u2019s helpful.\nJason English: No, that\u2019s helpful. On \u2013 sticking on the topic of volume. It looks like your guidance for next year is predicated on fairly firm volume. But you say you\u2019re assuming historical elasticities, which should be a net negative drag and maybe some of this COVID stuff comes back out. What are the offsets? Is this like the inventory reload later in the year on a catch-up? Or where are you seeing the offsets of that elasticity?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yes, a couple of things. One, we touched on it earlier was the inventory. So we are assuming some inventory rebuild with retailers and distributors. That\u2019s a component seasons \u2013 as a component of season were fantastic this past year. You get another 90% sell-through for holiday, and that will help from an ordering for this year. So we\u2019re leaning into seasons. And then continuing to activate against our brands and go-to-market strategy, a portion of that innovation, a portion of that is just working with our retail team to make sure we\u2019re bringing a new programming that we can support from a capacity standpoint. So those are the biggest factors offsetting the elasticity.\nJason English: Understood. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nMichele Buck: Thanks, Jason.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question\nMichael Lavery: Good morning. Thank you\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning\nMichael Lavery: You mentioned the stimulus benefits in snap in particular. And clearly, there\u2019s some risk there. But can you give a sense of what, if anything, you\u2019re hearing from consumers directly in terms of how they may have reacted with elevated benefits? And just how much of your performance could have been driven by that? Because we survey consumers. It looks like confection is the category that may have had the least benefit of all. Is that consistent with what you\u2019re seeing? Or can you just give us a sense of how you think about some of the risk around that?\nMichele Buck: Yes. We do think that there could have been less benefit. That\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing as well for us than for others. So I do think that\u2019s correct. At the same time, we do know that there\u2019s significant pressure out there, and we just want to really keep our fingers on the pulse of it to make sure that we aren\u2019t missing something. I mean certainly, we\u2019re not a category where there\u2019s a big private label component and people can easily just say, \"I\u2019m going to still participate but switch to lower brands.\" That\u2019s always been a benefit for us during times like this, but we do understand the pressure consumers are under.\nMichael Lavery: No, that\u2019s great color. And then just on some of your outlook where you \u2013 from a planning perspective, can you give a sense of some of the timing you expect for any of the inventory restocking? And you touched on the SKU rationalizations. How significant are those? I know you\u2019re swapping them out for higher velocity items. Is that a net positive? Is there timing for that, for anything we should keep in mind from how we think about modeling the year?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. I\u2019ll take the first part of that. If we look at the inventory deal, we\u2019re kind of planning it to spread evenly over the year. Obviously, it\u2019s gated a little bit by our capacity coming online. And so that\u2019s one factor. If I look more broadly at the sales profile for the year, we\u2019ll have more M&A benefits on the top line. In the first half of the year, we\u2019ll have more pricing benefit in the top line for the first half of the year, but the inventory build will be spread more evenly. On the SKU side, we see a minimal impact from that for the reasons Michele talked about, where we\u2019ve had to make choices for things we can supply. We\u2019ve been able to gain more facings and sell more core product. So net-net, that hasn\u2019t been a big factor. And we always \u2013 we had done SKU rent before we got into COVID just to make sure we were always thoughtful when we did add new innovation SKUs and make sure we had good velocity on those products. So we don\u2019t see a big impact.\nMichael Lavery: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Zaslow with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question\nKen Zaslow: Hey, good morning guys.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Hey Ken.\nKen Zaslow: Just two questions. One is you\u2019re hitting your 9% to 11% EPS growth in a capacity-constrained environment with higher labor costs, even with lower ad spending. If we \u2013 you are in a normalized environment, how much incremental EPS growth? Or how would you kind of frame the pent-up that may not be in the 9% to 11% as you emerge from this capacity constraint issues?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. That\u2019s a tough one to kind of think about because there are so many interconnected variables inside that equation. We\u2019ve got the robust volume, which is driving very high utilization on assets \u2013 too high, to be honest, which is why we\u2019re adding capacity. So you pick up some benefits there. But a lot hangs on that relative with the pricing drop through in response to commodity costs. So that\u2019s a tough one to say. There are too many interconnected components inside the P&L, Ken, to really probably give you a clear answer for that.\nKen Zaslow: Would you think it would be higher or lower? And I\u2019ll leave that question, and then I have another question.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Even that\u2019s kind of hard, Ken, because if I start at the very top, we would probably not be taking as many price increases as we\u2019ve taken, but for the need to cover the costs that we have coming through both commodities and the rest of the P&L. And so even at that very top line level, it\u2019s hard to say how the construction then below the rest of the P&L would flow through.\nKen Zaslow: Okay. Then my second question is with Pirate\u2019s Booty and Skinny Pop, you guys are obviously crushing it on the sales line. What were the key learnings that has changed your acquisition strategy with that? And what are you going to apply to Dots that continues to keep this \u2013 the snacking business at these levels, right? So your acquisition strategy has clearly evolved into something that has been quite successful. Can you talk about where the evolution is done and how you apply it to Dot\u00e2\u0080\u2122s?\nMichele Buck: Absolutely. We know that at the beginning of our journey into snacks, we had some challenges in some of our first acquisitions. And I guess it goes to maybe you catch a few toads on the way to the prince. But we learned a lot about what we\u2019re good at and what we\u2019re not good at. And we established some principles. And one of those principles was there\u2019s a certain size threshold that\u2019s critical for us in order to absorb a business and be able to really build it from there. We\u2019re not good creators of very small businesses and making them big. We also understand that our business model is all about a high gross margin, a strong gross margin that enables us to invest to grow capabilities and invest in our brands. And we got very, very stringent about those guidelines and those criteria for success. We focused a lot on building capability. Frankly, we didn\u2019t have a lot of M&A capability. And so we got a lot smarter about how to do the right due diligence, what were really the key questions we needed to understand. We started to see what we have to know going in. And I think as we did each acquisition, we got better at that. So with Pirate Booty and Skinny Pop, we got amazing brands. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re good at, is really getting a brand that has a strong consumer following. We\u2019d like to see brands that have tremendous repeat but low household penetration because that\u2019s \u2013 as consumers love them, and we can apply our capabilities to expanding distribution and investing to create awareness of the brand. The other thing we learned was the importance of supply chain. And early on, we had some struggles absorbing a lot of these smaller companies, didn\u2019t have their own supply chain. So thus, you saw when we went forward and bought Dots, we decided to buy the co-manufacturer Pretzels Inc. as well. So I think we\u2019ve consistently applied those lessons. As I said, we built a lot of capability and muscle along the way and got better at those key criteria of support of the brand\u2019s margins and the right supply chain.\nKen Zaslow: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you guys\nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Good morning. Thanks so much. I just wanted to follow up on one thing. I know you talked about investing in digital capabilities. And I hear the goal, part of it is advancing targeting and efficiency in media. I guess I\u2019m not quite sure what the mechanics are there and why those efforts would cost a good deal of capital. And maybe I\u2019m digging a little bit too deeply here. I just \u2013 those things historically seem to be more about learning, education, hiring consultants to help you in capital. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of connecting the dots there, if I can.\nMichele Buck: Sure. So one of the things that we have seen has been really critical is what\u2019s the data set. In the past, we relied on our own internal data set that we would analyze and do a traditional marketing mix modeling kind of activities. But we\u2019ve really created what we think is a proprietary approach to what we\u2019re doing, investing in other data sources and then integrating them into ours, building the tools that allow us to do that, utilizing the cloud across what we\u2019re doing. And so a lot of that has been in investing in those different areas to truly kind of break out in this space.\nKen Goldman: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I may just be missing it, but I hear that \u2013 I see in the press release and in the prepared remarks commentary on strong innovation. I\u2019m not sure I see a list of products that you would consider strong innovation. I can\u2019t recall Hershey ever not listing the new products as a new \u2013 as the year starts. And I realize this year is a little bit unusual, just as last year was. But I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of what those new items are that you\u2019re most excited of \u2013 or for and how you might qualify them?\nMichele Buck: Absolutely. I mean I\u2019d start by saying, first, hey, given where we are in a capacity-constrained world, our first focus is the core, the core, the core. And if we are masking out capacity with the core, we\u2019re really balancing what\u2019s the right innovation to continue to drive news, but we also want to be very efficient and we just want to maximize throughput. But that said, we do have several items that we are excited about. Reese\u2019s Potato Chip, Kit Kat Dark Chocolate with Strawberry, Kit Kat Hazelnuts. We also have, importantly, some really great new pack types. So we\u2019ve talked to you about price pack architecture, and we\u2019ve put a lot of focus on understanding different consumer occasions and where there was a need or an opportunity for a pack type that best meets that occasion and drives incremental consumption. So we\u2019re really excited about two of those. One is called the Pantry Pack. And think about that as \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I\u2019m going to describe it as almost a case of your product or a case pack of your product that\u2019s designed to sit easily either in your refrigerator or in your pantry that you can easily get out multiple units of single-serve product. And then we also have an item that\u2019s called the Super King. We have a standard bar, which is a smaller instant consumable item. We have a king-sized bar, which is a bigger instant consumable item. And consumers identified interest in Super King, which is an instant consumable pack that has more products and more individual units for sharing. And those pack types have tended to be really great innovation for us over time, highly sustainable.\nKen Goldman: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just a couple of quick ones for me. First, just \u2013 as we\u2019re looking at the gross margin guidance that you\u2019ve given for 2022. Just what do the acquisitions \u2013 are the acquisitions accretive, dilutive or neutral to gross margins?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. On the gross margin line, they\u2019re dilutive. And you can get a little sense for that with the new segmentation detail that we provided, but particularly dropping those in versus where before does create some dilution.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And then I know there\u2019s been a few comments, Steve, that you\u2019ve \u2013 or questions around just phasing. Could you just help us a little bit if \u2013 with regards to how we should think about the phasing, I guess, of margins through the year? So does pricing help a little bit more later in terms of gross margins? Just any guidance or any color you can provide in terms of how we should be thinking about the phasing of costs over the course of the year.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yes. We have \u2013 if I go back to kind of first half, second half, I won\u2019t get down to the quarters, but we expect to see tougher laps \u2013 a lot more pricing in the first half of the year. But we expect to see probably tougher gross margin in the first half. And probably Q2, in particular, will be a tough, just looking at the lap that we had last year. And we would expect to see gross margins \u2013 again, everything else equal in the plan, gradually improving as we get to the fourth quarter next year.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And then, Michele, in the prepared remarks, there was a comment around Salty Snacks talking about being in a position, I think, to integrate \u2013 more efficiently integrate future acquisitions. Can you just touch on that a little bit, just what that means?\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. So we\u2019re at a point now, where we are continuing to build scale in Salty Snacks. We started with SkinnyPop and Pirate\u2019s Booty. With the Dots business, we have sizable brands and so we are really looking at what is the optimal way to build the operating model around that entire piece of business. And that includes everything from \u2013 obviously, right now, we\u2019re very focused on integrating Dots and Pretzels Inc. But what\u2019s our end state of \u2013 from an operating model, how we operate, from a supply chain network, how we operate. This array of products do not require condition distribution, so they are very different than our core portfolio. So that\u2019s really the work that we\u2019re talking about there.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Great. And then last one for me. Plain household is very activated right now around the Cadbury Bunny Tryouts.\nMichele Buck: All right.\nBryan Spillane: All right. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks, guys.\nMichele Buck: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Growe: Hi. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nChris Growe: Just to add an editorial remark following Bryan there, we\u2019ve really enjoyed Super King. They\u2019re very dangerous, by the way, but we do enjoy those as well in our household here. I just had two quick ones. There\u2019s a comment in the prepared remarks about you have pricing coming through but that won\u2019t fully offset cost inflation. You also threw in though some manufacturing investments and that kind of thing. So, I just want to get a sense of how much inflation you have and then will pricing offset inflation but there\u2019s other factors that may weigh on the gross margin. Is that the way to think about it, or do you have any more color on that, Steve?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, a couple of things. In general pricing will offset the majority of our inflation. If I look at our commodity basket, we\u2019ve got the biggest increases year-over-year in places like sugar and dairy and packaging materials and specialty ingredients. We have pretty good visibility into that. We\u2019ve talked in the past about our hedging program and that gives us a pretty good picture. We\u2019ve also got inflation from a labor standpoint, and as one of the things that Michele said, labor and manufacturing value proposition is one area that we\u2019re leaning in pretty strongly this year. That\u2019s a differential investment than what we\u2019ve done in the past. And so, to answer your question, yes, pricing offsets the majority of the inflationary pieces, but it doesn\u2019t fully offset the additional investment that we\u2019re also making to improve the value proposition for employees.\nChris Growe: Okay. Have you given a level or a range of inflation for the year? Just to get a level set on where you are right now.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, so as we look across, I\u2019ll say the commodity basket but also other sources of inflation, you\u2019re talking mid to high single digits.\nChris Growe: Okay. Thank you. Then, just to be clear, your capacity that stands today, can you produce enough to meet demand, or are you still using third parties more heavily? Things like that that are going to weigh on the gross margin in addition to other inflation, given the fact that you\u2019re trying to catch up on production here.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. Today we don\u2019t have enough capacity to meet all the consumer demand. We\u2019ve had some floor manufacturing lines come online in 2021. We have more in Reese\u2019s and PayDay and Jolly Rancher Gummies that will come online in 2022. But even with that we feel like we\u2019re behind consumer demand. There is inflation through co-mans and partners in the network. Inflation flows through those lines just like it does from an internal standpoint and so that is a factor. But even as we rotate that outside support into internal production, we\u2019re still going to have inflation on the same labor lines and some of the materials lines.\nChris Growe: Okay, thank you. Then just one thought \u2013 I\u2019m sorry. Go ahead.\nMichele Buck: I was just going to say and there\u2019s not a lot of material change in our use of co-mans. Some of the items that are in highest demand are items that we uniquely produce. If you think about the uniqueness of some of the forms of some of our big confection items, so while we are trying to use any external co-mans and network as we can, there are some that it\u2019s just not available because of the proprietary nature of our product.\nChris Growe: Makes sense. Thank you. I just want to follow on Bryan\u2019s question. I think he asked about Dots and I think you mentioned that as dilutive to margin. Is that dilutive to EPS as well? Perhaps you answered that, but I may have missed that.\nSteve Voskuil: No. The Dots deal is accretive to earnings in the first year and it\u2019s about a two-point benefit.\nChris Growe: Okay. Just wanted to be sure on that. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. I noticed you\u2019re calling the two segments Confectionary and Salty Snacks. Those are two different parts of that snacking mega segment that you might have shown in a chart years ago, in a past Analyst Day. You don\u2019t say Sweets versus Salty, for example, capturing even more of that. Does that mean that for the foreseeable future those are the two segments that are going to be the company\u2019s focus? If you just kind of roll back the clock, just how did we get here, that Salty is the best adjacent category for Hershey?\nMichele Buck: Certainly, if you look at our business, these are the largest two areas of our business today and thus from a reporting perspective is exactly where we went to how we segment the business. As you look at some of the bets we\u2019ve placed, I think some of the larger assets, at least on the scale of the acquisitions we\u2019re doing, do tend to be available there. We\u2019ve tended to like many of the assets we\u2019ve seen and the growth there. So that had always been in our eyes early on, was that the two incremental areas of incrementality for us beyond Confection that we were most excited about were salty snacking and better for you overall.\nDavid Palmer: I remember years ago there was some \u2013 it didn\u2019t always go great with some of the adjacent category acquisitions and there was some talk that you didn\u2019t have the \u2013 that going into another aisle wasn\u2019t always easy. Could you talk about the capability building that you\u2019ve done in parallel to these growth brands that you\u2019ve acquired that look like they have fantastic momentum, but in terms of the internal workings what have you done to really make sure that you\u2019re going to give us the best growth possible in terms of the salty snack area? Then I\u2019ll pass it on. Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Yes. So certainly, I think if we think about winning in the store, I think we\u2019ve built some scale in the warehouse delivered snack general space. So from a in-store perspective that\u2019s been a key area of focus, but I guess I\u2019d go back to really some of my earlier comments around M&A and where we\u2019ve really built the best capabilities. I think we got very tight about what an asset needs to look like in order for us to \u2013 for it to be attractive for us and be a good fit for us, and that\u2019s about it has to start to be \u2013 obviously after identifying the two areas of incremental opportunity, it has to be significant scale, $100 million and above, and have strong gross margins because that lets us build the brand. Go for brands that have very strong repeat, which signifies that they have got a loyal consumer base and there\u2019s a bear there that we can build from, that we can build awareness with consumers through advertising and we can increase distribution and availability. Make sure that we\u2019ve got a good solid supply chain plan, because our whole goal is going to be about growth and we have to be lined up to do that. And then really, given it was a focus, building our talent and our capabilities and our inter-workings and our process. We spent a lot of time on that and getting much more robust in terms of the talent that we\u2019re applying in these spaces. Accountability and ownership across the enterprise, both with our M&A team, with the commercial units that are picking this up, and building a lot of muscle in due diligence and every piece of that, whether it\u2019s legal, whether it is analyzing the business. I think all of those things have been key.\nDavid Palmer: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Powers: Yes. Thanks and good morning. Going back and just to round out the conversation you were having with Jason and others earlier around volume, is what you\u2019re saying that you expect volume in terms of consumption and consumer takeaway to perhaps trend negative year-over-year given elasticities, but that you think your own shipments can remain flat to up given the dynamics that Steve talked about with respect to the seasonal activity and the inventory rebuild? Is that the read, or am I misinterpreting?\nSteve Voskuil: No, you\u2019ve got it. That\u2019s exactly right.\nSteve Powers: Okay, great. And then if we could, just because we\u2019re kind of getting a first look at the Salty Snacks business kind of standalone, can we just drill down there may be and talk a little bit about how you expect that business to shake out, price versus volume, maybe margin progression-wise in 3/22? Just I don\u2019t know, anything to call out there as we think about that business standalone?\nSteve Voskuil: Like the other parts of our business we look at both price and volume, but volume is very strong right now on Skinny, Pirate\u2019s and Dots. And so in some ways we\u2019re facing the same challenges that we have on the Confection businesses; we need capacity and trying to solve for capacity to continue to unlock the volume momentum that we\u2019re seeing. That\u2019s probably I would say one of the biggest issues, just like it is for the Confection business right now, but price also plays a role.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks very much. Just have another question on the Salty Snacks side. Maybe it\u2019s a bit longer term strategic. Michele, obviously I realize business is doing very well, growth is excellent. Demand, as you were suggesting, cemented your top brands in the segment, it\u2019s very strong. But it\u2019s still obviously a very small piece of your total company, total portfolio, and margins are still a bit obviously lower than your much higher scaled confection business. So if you think forward a few years, is there an argument to be made that maybe there can be some kind of overall margin progression up for Hershey, but that would likely be driven by the Salty Snacks area, just given increased scale, attention, media spend, what have you? I also kind of ask this in the context of kind of where your total company operating margin has been over the prior, call it seven years. Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Yes. I mean, we see a lot of opportunity in front of us. As you mentioned, we have been building scale, so you could say that we are subscale but we see tremendous opportunity for efficiencies and synergies as we integrate and gain scale. As we\u2019ve taken on these businesses, for us job one these are growth businesses. We bought them to accelerate our growth and to participate in high-growth segments that were very appealing to consumers. First and foremost, we wanted to go after that. Then, as you know, it takes some time to get to the right ultimate structure, the right phase of integration and really build towards that efficiency. And so we\u2019re in the middle of that right now. It will take us a few more years, but you see the growth rates from a top line perspective and a lot of the work that we\u2019re doing on the operating model and on the supply chain network are intended for us to drive up the margins to take advantage of the synergy that we think exists.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Fair enough. And then just quickly, obviously, we\u2019re close to Valentine\u2019s Day, smaller holiday for you, Easter if forthcoming and usually large. If we just think year-over-year, I guess just any perspective color in terms of demand you kind of feel so far with conversations with retailers relative to last year, which was obviously strong. And then, like, are there material differentiating factors in how you would actually provide supply for that season? Versus last year where demand was already high, and you did well and had decent supply. That\u2019s it. Thanks.\nMichele Buck: We\u2019re feeling good about both seasons. We see both of them being up versus prior year. We know that for us we had record sell-throughs throughout the seasons and that always leads to a strong season for us the next season, and also, it\u2019s a bit of a longer Easter season and that bodes well for us as well. So we\u2019re focused on working really closely with our retailers to get them the product that they\u2019re looking for, but we are anticipating that we\u2019ll be able to see growth on both those seasons.\nRob Dickerson: All right, super. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Feeney: Thanks so much for taking my question. With so many companies really struggling to take pricing, and I measure that in terms of not so much the level of pricing but the adjusted gross margin compared with the apparent elasticity, which in your case you out-gross margined trend year-over-year at negative 40 basis points is all world and the elasticity is limited. What specifically is it do you think about your categories or your company execution, your corporate mindset, that has allowed you to communicate and execute this pricing better than peers in the rest of the industry? I\u2019d just love to hear your perspective on that because I know you\u2019ve invested a lot in the kind of capabilities, not just now but I mean that\u2019s been a buzzword for Hershey for years as far as understanding what the data is telling you about your ability to price. Is it that? Is it the people? What is it?\nMichele Buck: I mean, I\u2019ll take a crack at a few things. First of all, I think that we all believe that at the root of that is having great brands that consumers see the value in. And right, it\u2019s about the consumer value proposition. It\u2019s one of the reasons that over the years we\u2019ve been such strong believers in investing in our brands, because the more we invest the greater awareness, the greater connectivity consumers have, and with that connectivity they\u2019re more connected to the brands, they don\u2019t want to switch to another brand. And so I think, I would say fundamentally I think that\u2019s one key thing that\u2019s an advantage for us. Secondly, we have had great analytics over the years. We\u2019ve always had a big focus on our elasticity models. You know that over time we\u2019ve always focused on pricing pretty aggressively is one of the tools in our toolkit to deliver our P&L and to deliver our business. And I think we just continued to try and take that capability to the next level all the time as we\u2019ve broadened it to, okay, we can get the insights on pricing in our category. Then we started to look at cross-category price elasticity so we could understand any trade-offs that could occur between our category and other categories. Then we started to invest in price pack architecture and look at how could we generate price realization without a list price but by changing the game. So I guess, I would say to me at the heart of it are those things, and I wouldn\u2019t underestimate as well the trusting relationships we have with our retailers. We\u2019ve always taken an approach of looking out for what\u2019s best for the category, not being so self-serving and so I think our retailers appreciate that and work really hard with us to get to the right outcomes because of that.\nJonathan Feeney: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nPamela Kaufman: I wanted to see if you can elaborate on what level of pricing growth is embedded into your guidance for 2022. And in terms of demand elasticity, it seems you experienced some elasticity in Confectionary, but this wasn\u2019t as evident in Snacks. Do you have different expectations for demand elasticity within Salty Snacks versus Confectionary? And how will pricing growth vary across the North America segments?\nSteve Voskuil: I\u2019ll take the first one. Overall pricing that we\u2019ve assumed in the plan is 5 points to 6 points. In terms of the difference with the Salty Snacks business, really not a big difference from an elasticity standpoint is the way we look at that and plan for that. Those two are pretty similar. The last question I might have missed. Was there a third one? Or was that it?\nPamela Kaufman: That was it. Thank you for that. And on media spend, can you elaborate on what your plans are for media investment in 2022? Do you expect it to increase? I know you mentioned that it will be stronger in the back half of the year, but how should we think about it overall? And what are some of the key initiatives there?\nMichele Buck: So, our dollars will be up slightly for the year in media. More of the increase will come towards the back part of the year as we\u2019re in an increasingly better supply position. And there aren\u2019t really a lot of big changes fundamentally in terms of how we\u2019re advertising. We do a significant portion of our spending that is in digital like we have been for many years and so there\u2019s not a big shift in how we\u2019re spending the dollars.\nPamela Kaufman: Great. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful.\nOperator: Our next question is from John Baumgartner with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning. Thanks for the question.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nJohn Baumgartner: Just building on, coming back to John Feeney\u2019s question and your areas of focus and sort of differentiation. Michele, can you speak to where you feel you are right now on the distribution side? You\u2019ve had quite a bit of success these last few years in terms of gaining new front end displays, modernizing middle of the store and the packaging there, the self-checkouts. At this point, where is your focus regarding those efforts for 2022 and beyond? Where are the opportunities that remain for TDPs and distribution and quality placements from here? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Sure. I think some of the areas of focus for us going forward, self-checkout, queueing lines are a big area of focus. Right now, we\u2019re seeing a lot of retailers, given some of the pressure on labor, focusing there. And the other big area and push for us is in what I would call non-traditional channels. We have over the years kind of started distribution in areas like home improvement stores, and as our products have done well there it then gives us the opportunity to expand from having some instant consumable items to putting our take-home portfolio, to even putting seasons during those specific times. Those are the biggest opportunities for focus in 2022.\nJohn Baumgartner: Then I guess related, thinking about distribution internationally, whether it\u2019s Brazil, India, Mexico, you\u2019ve been expanding distribution there as well. How do you think about the opportunities, whether it\u2019s traditional trade, modern trade, what\u2019s sort of driving that? Is there a way to think about either ACV penetration or total outlet penetration? How much opportunity is left as you think about sort of reframing international growth going forward?\nMichele Buck: Our businesses in most of the international markets \u2013 set aside Canada where we\u2019re very developed \u2013 we continue to have distribution opportunities. If I looked at Mexico I would say yes, traditional trade is an untapped and an area of opportunity going forward. If I look at the other markets in which we do business, the bulk of the business in India is traditional trade and so there I would call it more just getting broad distribution is the opportunity and building scale, continuing to build scale in areas like Brazil. Western Europe, we\u2019ve had a lot of strength just in getting our brands in distribution across the board in modern trade, in the regular trade there. Great success with Reese. We\u2019re seeding growth in a lot of other countries through our export model, which is really just a distributor model where we get our products on shelf. Again, a lot of that is in either Western Europe or parts of EMEA.\nJohn Baumgartner: Great. Thanks, Michele. Thanks for your time.\nMichele Buck: Sure.\nOperator: We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session, and I will now turn the call over to Melissa Poole for closing remarks.\nMelissa Poole: Thank you so much for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll be available throughout the day for any additional questions you may have. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Steve Voskuil",
            "content": "Good morning. No, I think you hit the highlights. We have a compensation reset that happens as we set new targets, and so that gives us a little bit on benefits side to deploy against the things that Michele said. Sure. As we formed our guidance for next year, we have an assumption inside there that there is an opportunity for some inventory build back into the network. Of course, we've also got some inventory building to do on our side, but from a retail distributor standpoint as well and that's part of our guidance. Yes. Gross margin dollars are going to grow. As we talked about in the prepared remarks, from a margin standpoint we expect there to be some dilution comparable to what we saw in '21. But from a dollars standpoint, yes, up year-over-year. Yes. Just to break that out a little bit, the shipping days we would estimate to be about a 2 point impact on the quarter. And from an elasticity standpoint, if you kind of took that to the side, if you took the shipping days to the side, pounds were about flat in the quarter, if that helps give you some idea. Thank you. Sure. Yes, a couple of things. One, we touched on it earlier was the inventory. So we are assuming some inventory rebuild with retailers and distributors. That's a component seasons \u2013 as a component of season were fantastic this past year. You get another 90% sell-through for holiday, and that will help from an ordering for this year. So we're leaning into seasons. And then continuing to activate against our brands and go-to-market strategy, a portion of that innovation, a portion of that is just working with our retail team to make sure we're bringing a new programming that we can support from a capacity standpoint. So those are the biggest factors offsetting the elasticity. Good morning Sure. I'll take the first part of that. If we look at the inventory deal, we're kind of planning it to spread evenly over the year. Obviously, it's gated a little bit by our capacity coming online. And so that's one factor. If I look more broadly at the sales profile for the year, we'll have more M&A benefits on the top line. In the first half of the year, we'll have more pricing benefit in the top line for the first half of the year, but the inventory build will be spread more evenly. On the SKU side, we see a minimal impact from that for the reasons Michele talked about, where we've had to make choices for things we can supply. We've been able to gain more facings and sell more core product. So net-net, that hasn't been a big factor. And we always \u2013 we had done SKU rent before we got into COVID just to make sure we were always thoughtful when we did add new innovation SKUs and make sure we had good velocity on those products. So we don't see a big impact. Hey Ken. Yes. That's a tough one to kind of think about because there are so many interconnected variables inside that equation. We've got the robust volume, which is driving very high utilization on assets \u2013 too high, to be honest, which is why we're adding capacity. So you pick up some benefits there. But a lot hangs on that relative with the pricing drop through in response to commodity costs. So that's a tough one to say. There are too many interconnected components inside the P&L, Ken, to really probably give you a clear answer for that. Sure. Even that's kind of hard, Ken, because if I start at the very top, we would probably not be taking as many price increases as we've taken, but for the need to cover the costs that we have coming through both commodities and the rest of the P&L. And so even at that very top line level, it's hard to say how the construction then below the rest of the P&L would flow through. Yes. On the gross margin line, they're dilutive. And you can get a little sense for that with the new segmentation detail that we provided, but particularly dropping those in versus where before does create some dilution. Sure. Yes. We have \u2013 if I go back to kind of first half, second half, I won't get down to the quarters, but we expect to see tougher laps \u2013 a lot more pricing in the first half of the year. But we expect to see probably tougher gross margin in the first half. And probably Q2, in particular, will be a tough, just looking at the lap that we had last year. And we would expect to see gross margins \u2013 again, everything else equal in the plan, gradually improving as we get to the fourth quarter next year. Yes, a couple of things. In general pricing will offset the majority of our inflation. If I look at our commodity basket, we've got the biggest increases year-over-year in places like sugar and dairy and packaging materials and specialty ingredients. We have pretty good visibility into that. We've talked in the past about our hedging program and that gives us a pretty good picture. We've also got inflation from a labor standpoint, and as one of the things that Michele said, labor and manufacturing value proposition is one area that we're leaning in pretty strongly this year. That's a differential investment than what we've done in the past. And so, to answer your question, yes, pricing offsets the majority of the inflationary pieces, but it doesn't fully offset the additional investment that we're also making to improve the value proposition for employees. Yes, so as we look across, I'll say the commodity basket but also other sources of inflation, you're talking mid to high single digits. Yes. Today we don't have enough capacity to meet all the consumer demand. We've had some floor manufacturing lines come online in 2021. We have more in Reese's and PayDay and Jolly Rancher Gummies that will come online in 2022. But even with that we feel like we're behind consumer demand. There is inflation through co-mans and partners in the network. Inflation flows through those lines just like it does from an internal standpoint and so that is a factor. But even as we rotate that outside support into internal production, we're still going to have inflation on the same labor lines and some of the materials lines. No. The Dots deal is accretive to earnings in the first year and it's about a two-point benefit. No, you've got it. That's exactly right. Like the other parts of our business we look at both price and volume, but volume is very strong right now on Skinny, Pirate's and Dots. And so in some ways we're facing the same challenges that we have on the Confection businesses; we need capacity and trying to solve for capacity to continue to unlock the volume momentum that we're seeing. That's probably I would say one of the biggest issues, just like it is for the Confection business right now, but price also plays a role. Good morning. I'll take the first one.

            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Good morning, Andrew. As you know, we take a pretty balanced approach in terms of focus on delivering the short term as well as making sure that we are building all the capabilities and continued investment to build the long term. So, as it relates to\u2014let me start with some of our SG&A. We think it's important to continue to build capabilities. Some of the places that we have been very focused are in the areas of ERP, obviously, so that we can really get a solid foundation of technology that we think will bring us tremendous benefit going forward in the future. We incur a lot of the expense now, and frankly, more of the benefit in the future. Also, in terms of digital as a big investment area, specifically we've had a big focus in advancing our capabilities to deliver more sophisticated targeting and get more efficiency in media. So we believe some of those lean-ins are really important to help us build those capabilities for the future. As we look at brand investment, as you know we are big believers in our business model that brand investment is key. We have always been very solid spenders, and we continue to believe that. We have moderated some of that spending as we've had supply challenges and constraints to make sure that we keep our very strong returns on that investment, so it's a balancing act. Some of the investments in media have enabled us to get to efficiency so that we are still delivering a pretty strong number of consumer impressions out there. We feel good about where our share of voice is. So, we're really trying to balance that and say, \u201cOkay, we'll moderate a bit now in brand investment,\u201d but certainly keep our eye on it as we go forward to make sure that we continue to protect that for the long term. Steve, do you have anything to add to that? Relative to the competition, yes, we would say everyone in the category seems to be having similar challenges, just as I would say pretty broadly in the industry that's the case. We anticipate the situation relative to delivering on demand to be about comparable across the competitors. Relative to market share, we believe that we will hold share this year. As you know, we've had some really significant gains over the past two-year period of time. We will have more tepid share performance in the first half of the year, building to a bit more strength in the second half due to laps alone. And relative to share of voice on advertising, we do track that and we feel really good about where we are from an advertising share of voice perspective. Let me start and answer your elasticity question. I'll give it to Steve to do the disaggregation. Nik, what we are assuming for this year is historical elasticities. To date on our pricing we have seen a little bit better performance versus historical. As we go into this year, we want to carefully keep our eye on the potential impact of broad inflation on the consumer. We know that there's been reduction, obviously, in government stimulus and SNAP, and with the inflation across the board it's just a top of mind watch out area for us, and that's why we really chose to say historical price elasticities is what we think is a smart and prudent planning move for us. Steve, do you want to talk about disaggregation? Well, I guess what I would say is we have a lot of actions in place to drive continuous improvement relative to our own supply. So certainly yes, there is no certain end state where I can tell you this is where the switch flips. But what I can tell you is we have had numerous programs underway. So first of all we focused a lot on optimizing demand. How do we get the most efficiency out of the capacity we have? By reducing complexity in changeovers, prioritizing SKUs, part of that included working with retailers to double and triple face our core items, which is always a great move because they are very high velocity so that makes a lot of sense. As it comes to supply, we are continuing to invest in incremental capacity. There is incremental capacity that will gradually come online as we go through this year and also into 2023 and 2024. We've also made some significant investments in manufacturing labor. Frankly, last year was a real challenge. Our people did real yeoman's work to just do whatever was needed to produce as much volume as possible, but it really wasn't sustainable in terms of having a reasonable employee value proposition for those folks. And so we have invested in labor. We won't get the benefit of that immediately because it takes time to train people, to get them up to speed, to be as efficient as our current workforce, but we do think it's important and a lot of that really just helps us to manage some of the overtime as well. So, we do have a lot of activities underway. We think that we will make continuous improvement, but under no circumstances would we really be out of the woods totally; we will continue to have pressure throughout the year. Our goal is just to continue to make improvements. Good morning. We've really tried to do a good dissection and deep dive to understand that as best possible, and I would tell you I think there are a number of things going on. First of all, we do know that there are some COVID related impacts. The change in consumer behaviors with consumers spending more time at home has clearly benefited some of our brands and categories because they're around their homes more to consume our products, and our products are more eaten in those types of environment than out and about restaurant environments, et cetera. I think that based on what we're seeing in consumer behavior, I think that while more people \u2013 and people have become more mobile, there also is a change of behavior that I think is here to stay to some degree, right? People enjoy spending time with their families. They appreciate them more given the COVID situation. They've gotten comfortable, some of them, the portion who are flexibly working and want to continue some of that. So I believe that some of that is here to stay. At the same time, we also did implement a number of new strategies in our business over the years that we think have also helped us. We really tried to do a better job of balancing innovation and the core to get more sustainable growth. And we have seen that, that had an impact on the business. I think we also think we've gotten smarter about pricing, where we have multiple levers on list price and price pack architecture that we can utilize. So I guess I'd tell you, we believe that there's part of both of that. So we do think that there is a sustainability and underlying sustainability, may not be all of it. But in addition to us, in particular, I think the category's relevancy has just increased during COVID. So those are some of our thoughts, Rob, I hope that's helpful. Thanks, Jason. Yes. We do think that there could have been less benefit. That's what we're seeing as well for us than for others. So I do think that's correct. At the same time, we do know that there's significant pressure out there, and we just want to really keep our fingers on the pulse of it to make sure that we aren't missing something. I mean certainly, we're not a category where there's a big private label component and people can easily just say, \"I'm going to still participate but switch to lower brands.\" That's always been a benefit for us during times like this, but we do understand the pressure consumers are under. Good morning. Absolutely. We know that at the beginning of our journey into snacks, we had some challenges in some of our first acquisitions. And I guess it goes to maybe you catch a few toads on the way to the prince. But we learned a lot about what we're good at and what we're not good at. And we established some principles. And one of those principles was there's a certain size threshold that's critical for us in order to absorb a business and be able to really build it from there. We're not good creators of very small businesses and making them big. We also understand that our business model is all about a high gross margin, a strong gross margin that enables us to invest to grow capabilities and invest in our brands. And we got very, very stringent about those guidelines and those criteria for success. We focused a lot on building capability. Frankly, we didn't have a lot of M&A capability. And so we got a lot smarter about how to do the right due diligence, what were really the key questions we needed to understand. We started to see what we have to know going in. And I think as we did each acquisition, we got better at that. So with Pirate Booty and Skinny Pop, we got amazing brands. And that's what we're good at, is really getting a brand that has a strong consumer following. We'd like to see brands that have tremendous repeat but low household penetration because that's \u2013 as consumers love them, and we can apply our capabilities to expanding distribution and investing to create awareness of the brand. The other thing we learned was the importance of supply chain. And early on, we had some struggles absorbing a lot of these smaller companies, didn't have their own supply chain. So thus, you saw when we went forward and bought Dots, we decided to buy the co-manufacturer Pretzels Inc. as well. So I think we've consistently applied those lessons. As I said, we built a lot of capability and muscle along the way and got better at those key criteria of support of the brand's margins and the right supply chain. Sure. So one of the things that we have seen has been really critical is what's the data set. In the past, we relied on our own internal data set that we would analyze and do a traditional marketing mix modeling kind of activities. But we've really created what we think is a proprietary approach to what we're doing, investing in other data sources and then integrating them into ours, building the tools that allow us to do that, utilizing the cloud across what we're doing. And so a lot of that has been in investing in those different areas to truly kind of break out in this space. Absolutely. I mean I'd start by saying, first, hey, given where we are in a capacity-constrained world, our first focus is the core, the core, the core. And if we are masking out capacity with the core, we're really balancing what's the right innovation to continue to drive news, but we also want to be very efficient and we just want to maximize throughput. But that said, we do have several items that we are excited about. Reese's Potato Chip, Kit Kat Dark Chocolate with Strawberry, Kit Kat Hazelnuts. We also have, importantly, some really great new pack types. So we've talked to you about price pack architecture, and we've put a lot of focus on understanding different consumer occasions and where there was a need or an opportunity for a pack type that best meets that occasion and drives incremental consumption. So we're really excited about two of those. One is called the Pantry Pack. And think about that as \u2013 I don't know, I'm going to describe it as almost a case of your product or a case pack of your product that's designed to sit easily either in your refrigerator or in your pantry that you can easily get out multiple units of single-serve product. And then we also have an item that's called the Super King. We have a standard bar, which is a smaller instant consumable item. We have a king-sized bar, which is a bigger instant consumable item. And consumers identified interest in Super King, which is an instant consumable pack that has more products and more individual units for sharing. And those pack types have tended to be really great innovation for us over time, highly sustainable. Yes, absolutely. So we're at a point now, where we are continuing to build scale in Salty Snacks. We started with SkinnyPop and Pirate's Booty. With the Dots business, we have sizable brands and so we are really looking at what is the optimal way to build the operating model around that entire piece of business. And that includes everything from \u2013 obviously, right now, we're very focused on integrating Dots and Pretzels Inc. But what's our end state of \u2013 from an operating model, how we operate, from a supply chain network, how we operate. This array of products do not require condition distribution, so they are very different than our core portfolio. So that's really the work that we're talking about there. All right. Thank you. Good morning. I was just going to say and there's not a lot of material change in our use of co-mans. Some of the items that are in highest demand are items that we uniquely produce. If you think about the uniqueness of some of the forms of some of our big confection items, so while we are trying to use any external co-mans and network as we can, there are some that it's just not available because of the proprietary nature of our product. Certainly, if you look at our business, these are the largest two areas of our business today and thus from a reporting perspective is exactly where we went to how we segment the business. As you look at some of the bets we've placed, I think some of the larger assets, at least on the scale of the acquisitions we're doing, do tend to be available there. We've tended to like many of the assets we've seen and the growth there. So that had always been in our eyes early on, was that the two incremental areas of incrementality for us beyond Confection that we were most excited about were salty snacking and better for you overall. Yes. So certainly, I think if we think about winning in the store, I think we've built some scale in the warehouse delivered snack general space. So from a in-store perspective that's been a key area of focus, but I guess I'd go back to really some of my earlier comments around M&A and where we've really built the best capabilities. I think we got very tight about what an asset needs to look like in order for us to \u2013 for it to be attractive for us and be a good fit for us, and that's about it has to start to be \u2013 obviously after identifying the two areas of incremental opportunity, it has to be significant scale, $100 million and above, and have strong gross margins because that lets us build the brand. Go for brands that have very strong repeat, which signifies that they have got a loyal consumer base and there's a bear there that we can build from, that we can build awareness with consumers through advertising and we can increase distribution and availability. Make sure that we've got a good solid supply chain plan, because our whole goal is going to be about growth and we have to be lined up to do that. And then really, given it was a focus, building our talent and our capabilities and our inter-workings and our process. We spent a lot of time on that and getting much more robust in terms of the talent that we're applying in these spaces. Accountability and ownership across the enterprise, both with our M&A team, with the commercial units that are picking this up, and building a lot of muscle in due diligence and every piece of that, whether it's legal, whether it is analyzing the business. I think all of those things have been key. Yes. I mean, we see a lot of opportunity in front of us. As you mentioned, we have been building scale, so you could say that we are subscale but we see tremendous opportunity for efficiencies and synergies as we integrate and gain scale. As we've taken on these businesses, for us job one these are growth businesses. We bought them to accelerate our growth and to participate in high-growth segments that were very appealing to consumers. First and foremost, we wanted to go after that. Then, as you know, it takes some time to get to the right ultimate structure, the right phase of integration and really build towards that efficiency. And so we're in the middle of that right now. It will take us a few more years, but you see the growth rates from a top line perspective and a lot of the work that we're doing on the operating model and on the supply chain network are intended for us to drive up the margins to take advantage of the synergy that we think exists. We're feeling good about both seasons. We see both of them being up versus prior year. We know that for us we had record sell-throughs throughout the seasons and that always leads to a strong season for us the next season, and also, it's a bit of a longer Easter season and that bodes well for us as well. So we're focused on working really closely with our retailers to get them the product that they're looking for, but we are anticipating that we'll be able to see growth on both those seasons. I mean, I'll take a crack at a few things. First of all, I think that we all believe that at the root of that is having great brands that consumers see the value in. And right, it's about the consumer value proposition. It's one of the reasons that over the years we've been such strong believers in investing in our brands, because the more we invest the greater awareness, the greater connectivity consumers have, and with that connectivity they're more connected to the brands, they don't want to switch to another brand. And so I think, I would say fundamentally I think that's one key thing that's an advantage for us. Secondly, we have had great analytics over the years. We've always had a big focus on our elasticity models. You know that over time we've always focused on pricing pretty aggressively is one of the tools in our toolkit to deliver our P&L and to deliver our business. And I think we just continued to try and take that capability to the next level all the time as we've broadened it to, okay, we can get the insights on pricing in our category. Then we started to look at cross-category price elasticity so we could understand any trade-offs that could occur between our category and other categories. Then we started to invest in price pack architecture and look at how could we generate price realization without a list price but by changing the game. So I guess, I would say to me at the heart of it are those things, and I wouldn't underestimate as well the trusting relationships we have with our retailers. We've always taken an approach of looking out for what's best for the category, not being so self-serving and so I think our retailers appreciate that and work really hard with us to get to the right outcomes because of that. Good morning. So, our dollars will be up slightly for the year in media. More of the increase will come towards the back part of the year as we're in an increasingly better supply position. And there aren't really a lot of big changes fundamentally in terms of how we're advertising. We do a significant portion of our spending that is in digital like we have been for many years and so there's not a big shift in how we're spending the dollars. Good morning. Sure. I think some of the areas of focus for us going forward, self-checkout, queueing lines are a big area of focus. Right now, we're seeing a lot of retailers, given some of the pressure on labor, focusing there. And the other big area and push for us is in what I would call non-traditional channels. We have over the years kind of started distribution in areas like home improvement stores, and as our products have done well there it then gives us the opportunity to expand from having some instant consumable items to putting our take-home portfolio, to even putting seasons during those specific times. Those are the biggest opportunities for focus in 2022. Our businesses in most of the international markets \u2013 set aside Canada where we're very developed \u2013 we continue to have distribution opportunities. If I looked at Mexico I would say yes, traditional trade is an untapped and an area of opportunity going forward. If I look at the other markets in which we do business, the bulk of the business in India is traditional trade and so there I would call it more just getting broad distribution is the opportunity and building scale, continuing to build scale in areas like Brazil. Western Europe, we've had a lot of strength just in getting our brands in distribution across the board in modern trade, in the regular trade there. Great success with Reese. We're seeding growth in a lot of other countries through our export model, which is really just a distributor model where we get our products on shelf. Again, a lot of that is in either Western Europe or parts of EMEA. Sure."

With that, I will turn it over to the Operator for the first question.\nOperator: At this time, we'll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. One moment while we poll for questions. Our first question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. You may proceed with your question.\nJason English: Good morning, folks. Thanks for stepping me in.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Morning.\nJason English: Congrats. Good morning. Congrats on a strong quarter, particularly given the strength that you're cycling in the prior year. But despite the straight, I can't help but remember that Shivery (ph) snacks have lost some of their sweetness pre -COVID, with little, if any, volumetric growth. COVID has clearly rejuvenated demand. In your capacity expansion effort seems to suggest that you believe that demand is going to stick. So, my question for you is why? Why shouldn't we believe that that -- sorry, that that's manage it's going to leak back out in the next year or two?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. Jason, as we look at the growth that we've seen, the category growth has really been pretty broad-based. It's really cut across regions; it's cut across cohorts. As we speak with consumers, we hear that some of that elevation of those take-home behaviors and new routines that occurred during COVID, that some of those will stick and sustain. Perhaps not all of them, not to the degree to which people were suggested that they shouldn't leave their homes, but we do believe that some of those will stick and stay around based on what we're hearing and seeing. And we do also see some of that continued strength as people are out and about, and mobility increases and that we're seeing a pretty good balance there. The other thing we've heard from consumers repeatedly that we've seen over the years is the emotional aspect of the category and how it fits with good and happy moment. And as those happy moments have continue to increase, as people, I think, are starting to believe they see somewhat of a light at the end of the tunnel in us working through the pandemic, those moments of happiness that we're really associated with, we see continuing. So that's really our perspective; is a lot of those routines, we think some of which will just continue into the future. That said, there are a lot of unknown. We certainly -- none of us know -- knew any of this was going to happen, and so we can't perfectly predict the future. As a constant capacity investment, what we've tried to do is be really prudent in our investment strategy. So, we've learned in in places on brands where we have clearly seen sustained growth over time and there's a lot of proof points that capacity will pay off and Reese's is a great example of that. Frankly, there are a couple of other places where we had elevated demand that we held for a bit before leaning into that capacity until we really thought we were at a point where we could guarantee the ROI. It is a bit of a balancing act, but at this point, we are bullish on the future.\nJason English: That's helpful context. Thank you. And I too like happy moments. One more question than I'll pass it on. In your prepared remarks, you touched on your collaborate space planning of retailers and resulting acceleration growth for both you and your categories. Can you elaborate on that? What's going on with the initiative and maybe provide some specifics on the changes that are being enacted by the retailers? Thank you. And I'll pass it on.\nMichele Buck: I'm sorry, can you just repeat the very first part of the question I missed?\nJason English: Well, your collaborative space planning for retailers.\nMichele Buck: Yes. Okay.\nJason English: You were talking about it in your prepared remarks. Give us more specifically. What is it, what's happened, what are the changes that are being an asset on the back end of it?\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. So, I would say over time, given that strong partnership we've had with retailers and particularly a lot of our category management expertise around analytics, we've always partnered with retailers in terms of how to think about the placement of confection in their store and ways to optimize category growth. Whether that's looking at heat maps with how people travel through convenience stores or years back when we found underutilized face under the checkout counter and convenience stores, and we put category there. Recently, a lot of the focus from our retailers, or there's been a big focus around the labor shortage and thus, a push for even more presence of self-checkout. And so, we've partnered really closely with those retailers to increase the presence of the category at self-checkout and to maximize the presence in those queuing lines leading up to checkout and particularly self-checkout. I mean it's a perfect fit with some of the struggles they're having around labor and a great opportunity to get the category out there and make sure that people don't miss that chance to have that last impulse purchase. So, I think our retailers are always focused on what's going on in the environment that they need to address in terms of their store layout. And fortunately, we've been able to help them with some of that.\nJason English: Makes a lot of sense. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. You may proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just first off, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in terms of competitive response with respect to the pricing moves that you've announced and how that impacts your expectations on elasticity because obviously thus far while early, would seem like volume trends have held up remarkably well in response to the pricing that you've taken.\nMichele Buck: Sure. As we have always seen in this category, it tends to be a very rational category relative to pricing. Our most recent pricing actions are on track, and we have seen several competitors take pricing actions this year, including over the past several weeks and we don't really expect that we'll see any material changes in pricing on shelf versus the competition, any changes in GAAP, etc.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. And then I guess more to Steve. I certainly understand all the moving parts on the supply chain right now, which makes getting overly specific right on '22, certainly a bit of a challenge. But if we take it from the top-line, consumption trends remained very elevated, Hershey 's got more pricing coming through, and it's had inventories depleted for really what will be, I guess, 2 years in a row. So, I would think all these things provide a reasonably good line of sight to -- at least an eye on algorithm sort of taper year, at least on sales in '22. Again, unless I'm missing something, and please point it out if I am. On the profitability side next year, obviously, you've already talked about, and I understand there'll be a supply chain pressures at least through the first half of the year. I guess my question is, would you expect the year-over-year gross margin pressure to sequentially improve as you move through the first half as the pricing flows through and you make improvements to the supply chain or our gross margin pressures potentially you expect it to be as, let's say, severe in the first half is maybe what you're seeing in the back half of this year?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Maybe I'll just start with the top line as you started. I think you're right. As we look at it today, it's hard to point to something that would say you don't have an on algorithm top line, you don't have momentum. Coming out of this year, we've got long Easter. You mentioned pricing, which will be a bigger factor next year than it was this year, that we also had hoped we'd see some capacity improvements would give us some upside. And then at some point, inventory replenished. And I think that's hard to call, but that -- we would expect to see some of that certainly over the course of next year. So still volatile, but I agree with the first premise. And then as you get into gross margin, I think there's still are a lot of moving pieces. Some of the things I think we can directionally point to, obviously the pricing will have a tailwind on gross margin as we look at raw material. The raw material inflation wasn't a big factor for us this year. We expect it will be a bigger factor as we look at next year. Logistics inflation that we're seeing now, I don't think we see a reason yet for that to break at least through the first half of next year. We'll have less spot market activity because some of the -- we'll be, say, better positioned for some of the stronger consumer demand than we were particularly in the third quarter. we still expect to see some labor inflation. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we've increased headcount to respond to some of the additional demand. Packaging inflation at resins. I think we keep waiting for that to break and it's probably moderated, but it hasn't reverted back to other levels or lower levels. So, I think at least through the first half we're going to see that still remain a pressure point and then we will see how capacity plays out in the broader supply chain network. The challenges we've had with logistics and trucks, warehousing, and all of those labor implications. So, when you step back from all of that, I'd say the gross margin piece is still has a lot of moving pieces. I think will give more clarity, obviously, when we get to February and provide full guidance. But right now, I'd say, particularly, for the first half of the year, we're going to see a lot of those costs\u2019 pressures in place.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. You may proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Michele, I wanted to ask about the decision to reduce advertising for the year. I guess it makes sense in the context of supply chain challenges and if you can't get the inventory where you want, why advertise? But the stock's done well and your sales have done well because of the market share gains. And I just wanted to know if you think there's risk to market share erosion from this decision. Do you think your competitors are doing the same thing, so it won't matter? How did you evaluate the risk and reward of that?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So first of all, I would say there is not a strategic change to our business model. We remain committed to investing in brands at some of the highest levels in our industry across the peer group. So, there's nothing that has changed about the strategy, so I want to be clear about that. As we looked at the decision, it really was driven by the fact that we have such elevated demand. And given that the supply chain challenges just wouldn't enable us to be able to meet the further demand that we would create through our very impactful advertising, that it just didn't make sense. It put more pressure on the supply chain. And also, we probably wouldn't get a good ROI because we wouldn't be able to fulfill that incremental demand. If we look at our market share right now, we don't think that the advertising cuts that we had executed impacted our share in Q3. And we're not the only ones having supply chain challenges and issues. So overall, I think across the board, even in the industry, we're seeing a lot of people manage advertising to supply as a challenge. We'll continue to focus on optimizing it. We will invest as much as we can, as much as we think we can sell. Certainly, we're investing in capacity going forward and we are very agile in how we're handling support behind our brands.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And can you give us any update on Halloween? Will Halloween just blow right through inventory or were you also challenged to fulfill demand for Halloween just like other products?\nMichele Buck: Yes. It is a very strong Halloween season, the biggest that we've ever had, with very strong double-digit growth on top of the strengths that we had last year. We have done our very best to get as much product out there as possible. Certainly, I would say supply pressures hit every aspect of the business, so tallying season would be a piece of that. But we're really excited about the growths that we've seen year-to-date, both in the category, as well as our own business, and I'm seeing lots of very picked-over [Indiscernible] out there as I'm out in stores because it'd be a good trick-or-treat, they send everything we've purchased from consumers as well as the people really flock back to that behavior.\nRobert Moskow: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. You may proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thanks so much. I wanted to start by asking about your perception of your labor relations right now. We've had a couple of strikes obviously in the food-at-home industry. So, I'm just curious for any updates how you see the risks there and so forth.\nMichele Buck: Yes. Absolutely. We are very focused on our labor and the first and foremost, I would just want to again, publicly acknowledge and thank our manufacturing employees. We have folks in our plants who have been with the Company for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. And it's really their focus, their dedication from the very beginning, that has enabled us to demonstrate and deliver the growth that we've been able to during this very dynamic environment. So, we have very long focus and believed and operated in a way that we believe we have the best advocate for advocates for the needs of our people. We are in constant communication with our employees, and we're really focused on our total employee value proposition with those employees. We know that we have highly competitive wage rates, we have excellent benefits, and then we routinely benchmark all of that. But we're also very focused on the softer factors that are very important to our employees. And that includes, especially during these times of global supply chain challenge, work-life balance, stress management, flexibility in hours, being able to get time off. And so, we have an acted a lot of strategies to really try and help with that. We have an always on recruiting approach and we have really amplified our recruiting efforts this year to be able to successfully manage through the challenges and increase our net headcount. We've also leveraged the analytics to, as I said, understand some of the things most important to our workforce. So, we're very focused on that. We are very focused on prioritizing the needs of that group and continuing to look at ways that we can optimize the situation in terms of supply and demand. So, we feel pretty good about that.\nKen Goldman: Great. Thank you for that. And then a quick one for Steve. Steve, year-to-date, your corporate other expense line has been up fairly meaningfully from both 2020 and 2019. I realized that grows somewhat in line with sales. But I'm curious how we should think about when an ongoing annual number for that corporate line is, especially as we think about modeling 2022. Are there any potential one-time headwinds we should be thinking about that maybe go away next year or is this kind of a good runway to think about?\nSteve Voskuil: You'll see incentive compensation is one of the big pieces in there, and as we turn the page to next year, that'll be one item that resets. Otherwise, there's not as much change. We talked about this year we had some planned investments in ERP and digital. We'll have some of those kinds of investments I expect next year. We also had a little bit heavier medical claims and benefits impacts this year coming off of COVID. So that may or may not continue next year, but probably the incentive reset will be the biggest year-over-year change as we start the next year.\nKen Goldman: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. You may proceed with your question.\nBryan Spillane: Hi. Good morning, everybody.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nBryan Spillane: So, maybe just to tie one more up on '22. And, I guess Steve, just below the operating profit line, this year there has been some benefit from interest expense being lower. And I -- so I guess my question is just is we're looking in the next year and we're just looking at our models below the operating profit line. Is there anything that we should be thinking about in terms of puts and takes there?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. Nothing major. I think if I was to look at tax this year has been lumpy, but if I look at where we set the final guidance for the year from a tax standpoint and I look to next year, I'd expect relatively similar level for next year. We had some one-timers this year that will not recur next year. We talked about it in the second quarter and to some extent, this quarter as well. So, I can't take those out. And I look at the finishing tax position I see they the same interest expense. I don't expect a lot of change by flat year-over-year. So, I hope that helps. Not much movement year-over-year, other than the one-timers.\nBryan Spillane: Yeah. No, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up on the capacity expansion. I guess two questions related to that. One is, what type of investment is it? Meaning is it actual physical product production lines, or is it investments in further down the manufacturing, like packaging capacity? Just trying to get a sense of actually what type of capacity you're adding.\nMichele Buck: Yes, we're adding capacity on both. Both, in terms of product production, as well as packaging across multiple brands. I think we spoke before about building our agile fulfillment center. That is up and coming online. So, it's really across the board.\nBryan Spillane: And then if we're thinking about or if you could give us a sense of the capacity now that you're planning to add just where you stand now in terms of capacity utilization or available capacity. And I guess, what's underneath my question is, we've been adding incrementally to this -- to CapEx over the last couple of years, and just trying to get an understanding of whether we're going to stay in this elevated cycle for a while or are we getting to the point where you feel like you're going to have enough flexibility in capacity?\nMichele Buck: I'd start by saying capacity utilization varies by brand and piece of the business, so each brand is in a slightly different position. We certainly have invested several hundred million dollars to install at least 9 new lines since the pandemic began, and we do have more planned for '23 and for '24. But Steve, do you want to talk a little bit more about where we are in that total investment?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. If you look back really the last 2 years and this year, we have done a lot of infrastructure spending. So, we talked about the agile fulfillment center. We've got a Canadian DC that's in process, and of course, the ERP transformation, which is a big component as well. Now, I'd say we have to finish those projects of our pivoting more towards the capacity side. So, I think like we talked about machines packaging. So far, we haven't had the need to build buildings and infrastructure of that sort. But as we look at the total, next year, as we talked about a slight increase versus this year from a CapEx standpoint, really due to project timing this year more than anything else. And then, as we look further, I know we get more guidance on that, as we get into next year.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Thanks. I'll leave it there. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Modi with RBC Capital Markets. You may proceed with your question.\nNick Modi: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Michele, I wanted to ask about market share, if you could just give us some context. Obviously, I think a big question has been, how much of the share gains you -- Hershey has had over the last 12 to 18 months and how much of that was taken. Looks like quite a bit was taken. So can you just talk about where you see the most stickiness, where things have retrenched. And then obviously discussions are taking place now about 2022 shelf allocation. Just wanted to get some of your early thoughts on how you think you'll progress there.\nMichele Buck: Yeah, sure. Since the pandemic, we have been able to hold on to about 50% of the market share gains that we had realized. We see certain areas of the business where those numbers are very strong seasons in particular, as we mentioned in our remarks. We had gained 500 basis points and we held on to about 75% of that. Take-home also has been very strong in terms of our retention. So, we're pleased with what we've been able to hold onto. And as we continue to unlock more capacity and reinstate some of that advertising, we believe that we'll see some continued strengths going forward.\nNick Modi: And then just a follow-up on assortment because I know that's been a big area that retailers have been focused on given all the supply chain challenges. So, as you engage with retailers regarding space with some of your initiatives, how are you guys thinking about your overall assortment on the shelf?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So, I would say, we know that assortment bags are really big sellers with consumers. And there's been a trend towards that, particularly during the seasons and especially during Halloween. So, we have definitely seen that part of the category tick up relative to assortment bag. If I look broadly at assortments and what is on-the-shelf, what we've been trying to do is to optimize our portfolio of SKU for right now based on what consumer demand is, where the demand is, and availability of capacity. And we've really prioritized a lot of our core items that the core of the core of the core items, which are the highest velocity item even to the point where we're focusing in some places, on shelf you will see double facing of those items as opposed to the presence of perhaps some second or third tier items. So, we've spent a lot of time on this, and we think we've taken a really smart approach that has enabled us to generate that very positive demand and at the same time, maximize the available output that we have on capacity and on supply.\nNick Modi: Excellent. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. You may proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Good morning. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: Just wanted to come back to the trajectory of capacity relief. I know you've quantified the reload hit for this year. Just in terms of at least how you're planning for it, assuming that's all set for next year, can you give us sense of how you expect that to unfold and just how soon you can start to see a relief and reloading retailer inventories?\nMichele Buck: Steve, you want to talk about that.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. I think it's hard to call exactly how that's going to phase over next year. We've got -- as we've talked about in the prepared remarks, we've got capacity that's come online this year. We've got more coming online next year. And I think, between consumer demand and our capacity coming online, it's going to be a challenge to quarterly profile that. We'll hear more in February. I will have a better picture at that point.\nMichael Lavery: But and is the issue more the production lines or labor or is it both?\nSteve Voskuil: It's a bit of both. Labor only from availability. Like everyone, we've done a lot of hiring this year. We talked about it again in the prepared remark. We've increased headcount but we've also seen more attrition than we've had in the past. So, there's a labor component, but there's also a machine capacity component.\nMichele Buck: And I'd also say there has been a logistics and shipping component, as well, although we've been able to take some actions and have seen some improvement on that.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks. And you mentioned in the prepared remarks about the strength in unmeasured channels and just how your total sell-through is stronger than what we see in the measured channels. Can you give a sense of if there's any certain products or channels in particular driving that and just how sustainable it might be?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. I mean, we're seeing it the up versus the pre -pandemic levels. And I think over a 2-year, it's relatively in line with what we would call normal. So, low single-digit growth is kind of what you should be thinking there.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. You may proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Morning.\nAlexia Howard: Right. 2 questions from me. Firstly, you mentioned in the prepared remarks that some of the emerging markets are still holding up well. I wonder if you could give us a quick tour of India, Brazil, and Mexico. How long do all they collectively and what are the main initiatives that are in those areas? And then I have a follow-up.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah.\nMichele Buck: Steve, do you want to talk about the size and --\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. The 3 markets are doing well. I think, as we started the same point, I think on the second quarter call, but we are gaining share in all 3 of those markets in our key brands. And so, we're pleased with the progress that we're making. You can continue to see a fact from the top line due to the benefits of some of the go-to-market work, including the model in China but also efficiencies in the other markets. So, we're pleased with the way things are going with. We look to the fourth quarter, some of the same capacity challenges that we've seen in the U.S. and North America are going to have some impact on those markets as well. But really pleased -- with pleased with the distribution gains. We've seen the velocity and the share across those 3 markets.\nMichele Buck: I'd say in terms of the key initiatives, I would probably bucket them across in terms of it is investing in the core. So, India, we're still focused on the chocolate expansion and broadening that. In Mexico, we have both a strong chocolate portfolio as well as Pelon Pelo Rico in the sweets area and in Brazil continuing to fill out our portfolio. We launched Halloween in Brazil for the first time. We had a premium dark line that came out in Brazil a while back that's been very successful. And across all of those markets, investing to continue to build those brands and to build distribution I think are really the key priorities there.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And then as a follow-up. I didn't see any reference to the e-commerce channels in the prepared remarks this time around. Has that channel slowed down materially? Obviously, it was very elevated during the pandemic and I'm just wondering what's happening over there and whether that's becoming maybe less of a focus this year?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So overall, I think perhaps not totally unexpectedly, from a broad consumer perspective, overall trips to stores, both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce are up both versus 2020 and 2019. In-store trips have pretty much rebounded to the pre -pandemic level. And in e-commerce, what we've seen is the trips have largely maintained versus last year. But we have seen the dollar per trip go down as many of those consumers who were more exclusively purchasing in e-commerce, shifted more of their spend back into bricks and mortar. Most of the e-commerce shoppers are not exclusively e-commerce, they shop omni-channel. So, we saw some of that shifting occur. Relative to our business in particular, our e-commerce retail sales are up versus last year with our omni-channel partners, despite the significant growths that we had year ago. And also, despite the significant growth that we're seeing in bricks-and-mortar as well.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Powers, with Deutsche Bank. You may proceed with your question.\nSteve Powers: Thanks. Good morning. With the -- just back to the capacity question. Again, just with the timing of exactly when you might be able to alleviate pressure on those most capacity constraints of brands hard to call as you talked about with Michael, I guess I wanted to cycle back to Rob's question, just get a sense for how long you think this lower run-rate on marketing could continue, and how long you'd be comfortable letting it run, just given the competitive backdrop.\nMichele Buck: I think relative to the marketing investment, we're just going to -- we're continuously being agile and flexible. And as we are able to either bring new capacity online or make adjustments in how we are operating, because we've done -- we've had a lot of focus in things like freeing up additional capacity by reducing changeovers, by focusing on core SKU. So, I'd say we're in a period of continuous improvement both in terms of capacity investment and maximizing the capacity we have. So, we closely monitor that so that as we do see upticks, we can then quickly reassess and adjust our spending accordingly.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. All I would add is when we talked in the past about the analytics that we have around our media investment, and we put a lot of our own investment in building out that analytics capabilities. So don't think of the media tests as sort of a peanut butter approach. It's very surgical, very precise to the areas where we have capacity constraints and very protective of the high ROI core brand advertising.\nSteve Powers: Yeah. That makes sense. Just if I could, how much of those analytics and those considerations are driven by your internal -- aspects that are internal to you and your control in your capacity versus, versus the competitive backdrop, right? So, right now, it sounds like you and competitors are all on that kind of a similar spot. And so, as you pull back, you're not overly concerned about share of voice being lost, etc. But if you got -- if you felt you were more offside on capacity relative to competitors and saw them picking things up, how does that affect you? And would you be ramping up ahead of capacity on marketing just to maintain that share of voice or how do you think about that?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. I know our retail sales team, has very strong presence to start the week. Between what's on air and what's on-shelf and what's being promoted. We have very good data coming back on what's happening from a competitive set. And all of that does feed into the decision as we think about how we're going to optimize our marketing and media spend.\nSteve Powers: Okay, great. Just one last question if I could. You called out the price increase executed recently in the U.S. and your expectation for pricing to play a bigger role in next year's growth, which makes good sense. Is there any color you can provide just in terms of the cadence of how you expect net-realized price to flow? Is it going to be relatively even throughout the year, is it -- does it build? Just any context there would be helpful. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. We're going to have more in the first half of '22. Think about the most recent price increase will kick in in the first quarter plus we'll have carryover from the price increases that we announced earlier this year. So, the first half will have more price relative to the back-half.\nSteve Powers: Perfect. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. You may proceed with your question.\nJonathan Feeney: Hey, good morning and thanks. Just a quick one for me. I'm trying to understand, for Q3 and your numbers, I'm off by a few days and your numbers probably they're mine, but clearly, I have 9, 7 for pricing in measured pricing in Q3, U.S. scanner channels. And that's significant -- when pricing broadly is -- at retail is ahead of what wholesale pricing appears to be, what's going on and does that tell us something about the kind of pricing you'd expect to flow through? And is there any possibility that retailers are margining up a little bit, at least relative to what you would consider standard operations. Thanks very much.\nSteve Voskuil: We're not seeing retailers margin up in a material way. What you do see is a lot of impact of mix and retail when you really got to click down to get down to pack type and see what's happening. And when you get down to that level, it's consistent. More than what you see when you look at just at the top level.\nJonathan Feeney: Got you. So, you say, it's more of a mix phenomenon then?\nSteve Voskuil: That's right.\nJonathan Feeney: Cool. Thanks very much.\nSteve Voskuil: You bet.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn this call back over to Ms. Melissa Poole for closing remarks.\nMelissa Poole: Thanks so much for joining us this morning. We'll certainly be available throughout the day for any additional questions you may have. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Voskuil",
            "content": "Morning. Sure. Maybe I'll just start with the top line as you started. I think you're right. As we look at it today, it's hard to point to something that would say you don't have an on algorithm top line, you don't have momentum. Coming out of this year, we've got long Easter. You mentioned pricing, which will be a bigger factor next year than it was this year, that we also had hoped we'd see some capacity improvements would give us some upside. And then at some point, inventory replenished. And I think that's hard to call, but that -- we would expect to see some of that certainly over the course of next year. So still volatile, but I agree with the first premise. And then as you get into gross margin, I think there's still are a lot of moving pieces. Some of the things I think we can directionally point to, obviously the pricing will have a tailwind on gross margin as we look at raw material. The raw material inflation wasn't a big factor for us this year. We expect it will be a bigger factor as we look at next year. Logistics inflation that we're seeing now, I don't think we see a reason yet for that to break at least through the first half of next year. We'll have less spot market activity because some of the -- we'll be, say, better positioned for some of the stronger consumer demand than we were particularly in the third quarter. we still expect to see some labor inflation. And as we said in the prepared remarks, we've increased headcount to respond to some of the additional demand. Packaging inflation at resins. I think we keep waiting for that to break and it's probably moderated, but it hasn't reverted back to other levels or lower levels. So, I think at least through the first half we're going to see that still remain a pressure point and then we will see how capacity plays out in the broader supply chain network. The challenges we've had with logistics and trucks, warehousing, and all of those labor implications. So, when you step back from all of that, I'd say the gross margin piece is still has a lot of moving pieces. I think will give more clarity, obviously, when we get to February and provide full guidance. But right now, I'd say, particularly, for the first half of the year, we're going to see a lot of those costs' pressures in place. You'll see incentive compensation is one of the big pieces in there, and as we turn the page to next year, that'll be one item that resets. Otherwise, there's not as much change. We talked about this year we had some planned investments in ERP and digital. We'll have some of those kinds of investments I expect next year. We also had a little bit heavier medical claims and benefits impacts this year coming off of COVID. So that may or may not continue next year, but probably the incentive reset will be the biggest year-over-year change as we start the next year. Yeah. Nothing major. I think if I was to look at tax this year has been lumpy, but if I look at where we set the final guidance for the year from a tax standpoint and I look to next year, I'd expect relatively similar level for next year. We had some one-timers this year that will not recur next year. We talked about it in the second quarter and to some extent, this quarter as well. So, I can't take those out. And I look at the finishing tax position I see they the same interest expense. I don't expect a lot of change by flat year-over-year. So, I hope that helps. Not much movement year-over-year, other than the one-timers. Yeah. If you look back really the last 2 years and this year, we have done a lot of infrastructure spending. So, we talked about the agile fulfillment center. We've got a Canadian DC that's in process, and of course, the ERP transformation, which is a big component as well. Now, I'd say we have to finish those projects of our pivoting more towards the capacity side. So, I think like we talked about machines packaging. So far, we haven't had the need to build buildings and infrastructure of that sort. But as we look at the total, next year, as we talked about a slight increase versus this year from a CapEx standpoint, really due to project timing this year more than anything else. And then, as we look further, I know we get more guidance on that, as we get into next year. Good morning. Yeah. I think it's hard to call exactly how that's going to phase over next year. We've got -- as we've talked about in the prepared remarks, we've got capacity that's come online this year. We've got more coming online next year.

The 3 markets are doing well. I think, as we started the same point, I think on the second quarter call, but we are gaining share in all 3 of those markets in our key brands. And so, we're pleased with the progress that we're making. You can continue to see a fact from the top line due to the benefits of some of the go-to-market work, including the model in China but also efficiencies in the other markets.

We look to the fourth quarter, some of the same capacity challenges that we've seen in the U.S. and North America are going to have some impact on those markets as well. But really pleased -- with pleased with the distribution gains. We've seen the velocity and the share across those 3 markets. Yeah. All I would add is when we talked in the past about the analytics that we have around our media investment, and we put a lot of our own investment in building out that analytics capabilities. So don't think of the media tests as sort of a peanut butter approach.

        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Good morning. Yeah. Jason, as we look at the growth that we've seen, the category growth has really been pretty broad-based. It's really cut across regions; it's cut across cohorts. As we speak with consumers, we hear that some of that elevation of those take-home behaviors and new routines that occurred during COVID, that some of those will stick and sustain. Perhaps not all of them, not to the degree to which people were suggested that they shouldn't leave their homes, but we do believe that some of those will stick and stay around based on what we're hearing and seeing. And we do also see some of that continued strength as people are out and about, and mobility increases and that we're seeing a pretty good balance there. The other thing we've heard from consumers repeatedly that we've seen over the years is the emotional aspect of the category and how it fits with good and happy moment. And as those happy moments have continue to increase, as people, I think, are starting to believe they see somewhat of a light at the end of the tunnel in us working through the pandemic, those moments of happiness that we're really associated with, we see continuing. So that's really our perspective; is a lot of those routines, we think some of which will just continue into the future. That said, there are a lot of unknown. We certainly -- none of us know -- knew any of this was going to happen, and so we can't perfectly predict the future. As a constant capacity investment, what we've tried to do is be really prudent in our investment strategy. So, we've learned in in places on brands where we have clearly seen sustained growth over time and there's a lot of proof points that capacity will pay off and Reese's is a great example of that. Frankly, there are a couple of other places where we had elevated demand that we held for a bit before leaning into that capacity until we really thought we were at a point where we could guarantee the ROI. It is a bit of a balancing act, but at this point, we are bullish on the future. I'm sorry, can you just repeat the very first part of the question I missed? Yes. Okay. Yes, absolutely. So, I would say over time, given that strong partnership we've had with retailers and particularly a lot of our category management expertise around analytics, we've always partnered with retailers in terms of how to think about the placement of confection in their store and ways to optimize category growth. Whether that's looking at heat maps with how people travel through convenience stores or years back when we found underutilized face under the checkout counter and convenience stores, and we put category there. Recently, a lot of the focus from our retailers, or there's been a big focus around the labor shortage and thus, a push for even more presence of self-checkout. And so, we've partnered really closely with those retailers to increase the presence of the category at self-checkout and to maximize the presence in those queuing lines leading up to checkout and particularly self-checkout. I mean it's a perfect fit with some of the struggles they're having around labor and a great opportunity to get the category out there and make sure that people don't miss that chance to have that last impulse purchase. So, I think our retailers are always focused on what's going on in the environment that they need to address in terms of their store layout. And fortunately, we've been able to help them with some of that. Sure. As we have always seen in this category, it tends to be a very rational category relative to pricing. Our most recent pricing actions are on track, and we have seen several competitors take pricing actions this year, including over the past several weeks and we don't really expect that we'll see any material changes in pricing on shelf versus the competition, any changes in GAAP, etc. Yes. So first of all, I would say there is not a strategic change to our business model. We remain committed to investing in brands at some of the highest levels in our industry across the peer group. So, there's nothing that has changed about the strategy, so I want to be clear about that. As we looked at the decision, it really was driven by the fact that we have such elevated demand. And given that the supply chain challenges just wouldn't enable us to be able to meet the further demand that we would create through our very impactful advertising, that it just didn't make sense. It put more pressure on the supply chain. And also, we probably wouldn't get a good ROI because we wouldn't be able to fulfill that incremental demand. If we look at our market share right now, we don't think that the advertising cuts that we had executed impacted our share in Q3. And we're not the only ones having supply chain challenges and issues. So overall, I think across the board, even in the industry, we're seeing a lot of people manage advertising to supply as a challenge. We'll continue to focus on optimizing it. We will invest as much as we can, as much as we think we can sell. Certainly, we're investing in capacity going forward and we are very agile in how we're handling support behind our brands. Yes. It is a very strong Halloween season, the biggest that we've ever had, with very strong double-digit growth on top of the strengths that we had last year. We have done our very best to get as much product out there as possible. Certainly, I would say supply pressures hit every aspect of the business, so tallying season would be a piece of that. But we're really excited about the growths that we've seen year-to-date, both in the category, as well as our own business, and I'm seeing lots of very picked-over [Indiscernible] out there as I'm out in stores because it'd be a good trick-or-treat, they send everything we've purchased from consumers as well as the people really flock back to that behavior. Yes. Absolutely. We are very focused on our labor and the first and foremost, I would just want to again, publicly acknowledge and thank our manufacturing employees. We have folks in our plants who have been with the Company for 20 years, 30 years, 40 years. And it's really their focus, their dedication from the very beginning, that has enabled us to demonstrate and deliver the growth that we've been able to during this very dynamic environment. So, we have very long focus and believed and operated in a way that we believe we have the best advocate for advocates for the needs of our people. We are in constant communication with our employees, and we're really focused on our total employee value proposition with those employees. We know that we have highly competitive wage rates, we have excellent benefits, and then we routinely benchmark all of that. But we're also very focused on the softer factors that are very important to our employees. And that includes, especially during these times of global supply chain challenge, work-life balance, stress management, flexibility in hours, being able to get time off. And so, we have an acted a lot of strategies to really try and help with that. We have an always on recruiting approach and we have really amplified our recruiting efforts this year to be able to successfully manage through the challenges and increase our net headcount. We've also leveraged the analytics to, as I said, understand some of the things most important to our workforce. So, we're very focused on that. We are very focused on prioritizing the needs of that group and continuing to look at ways that we can optimize the situation in terms of supply and demand. So, we feel pretty good about that. Good morning. Yes, we're adding capacity on both. Both, in terms of product production, as well as packaging across multiple brands. I think we spoke before about building our agile fulfillment center. That is up and coming online. So, it's really across the board. I'd start by saying capacity utilization varies by brand and piece of the business, so each brand is in a slightly different position. We certainly have invested several hundred million dollars to install at least 9 new lines since the pandemic began, and we do have more planned for '23 and for '24. But Steve, do you want to talk a little bit more about where we are in that total investment? Yeah, sure. Since the pandemic, we have been able to hold on to about 50% of the market share gains that we had realized. We see certain areas of the business where those numbers are very strong seasons in particular, as we mentioned in our remarks. We had gained 500 basis points and we held on to about 75% of that. Take-home also has been very strong in terms of our retention. So, we're pleased with what we've been able to hold onto. And as we continue to unlock more capacity and reinstate some of that advertising, we believe that we'll see some continued strengths going forward. Yes. So, I would say, we know that assortment bags are really big sellers with consumers. And there's been a trend towards that, particularly during the seasons and especially during Halloween. So, we have definitely seen that part of the category tick up relative to assortment bag. If I look broadly at assortments and what is on-the-shelf, what we've been trying to do is to optimize our portfolio of SKU for right now based on what consumer demand is, where the demand is, and availability of capacity. And we've really prioritized a lot of our core items that the core of the core of the core items, which are the highest velocity item even to the point where we're focusing in some places, on shelf you will see double facing of those items as opposed to the presence of perhaps some second or third tier items. So, we've spent a lot of time on this, and we think we've taken a really smart approach that has enabled us to generate that very positive demand and at the same time, maximize the available output that we have on capacity and on supply. Steve, you want to talk about that. And I'd also say there has been a logistics and shipping component, as well, although we've been able to take some actions and have seen some improvement on that. Yeah. I mean, we're seeing it the up versus the pre -pandemic levels. And I think over a 2-year, it's relatively in line with what we would call normal. So, low single-digit growth is kind of what you should be thinking there. Good morning. Steve, do you want to talk about the size and -- I'd say in terms of the key initiatives, I would probably bucket them across in terms of it is investing in the core. So, India, we're still focused on the chocolate expansion and broadening that. In Mexico, we have both a strong chocolate portfolio as well as Pelon Pelo Rico in the sweets area and in Brazil continuing to fill out our portfolio. We launched Halloween in Brazil for the first time. We had a premium dark line that came out in Brazil a while back that's been very successful. And across all of those markets, investing to continue to build those brands and to build distribution I think are really the key priorities there. Yes. So overall, I think perhaps not totally unexpectedly, from a broad consumer perspective, overall trips to stores, both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce are up both versus 2020 and 2019. In-store trips have pretty much rebounded to the pre -pandemic level. And in e-commerce, what we've seen is the trips have largely maintained versus last year. But we have seen the dollar per trip go down as many of those consumers who were more exclusively purchasing in e-commerce, shifted more of their spend back into bricks and mortar. Most of the e-commerce shoppers are not exclusively e-commerce, they shop omni-channel. So, we saw some of that shifting occur. Relative to our business in particular, our e-commerce retail sales are up versus last year with our omni-channel partners, despite the significant growths that we had year ago. And also, despite the significant growth that we're seeing in bricks-and-mortar as well. I think relative to the marketing investment, we're just going to -- we're continuously being agile and flexible. And as we are able to either bring new capacity online or make adjustments in how we are operating, because we've done -- we've had a lot of focus in things like freeing up additional capacity by reducing changeovers, by focusing on core SKU. So, I'd say we're in a period of continuous improvement both in terms of capacity investment and maximizing the capacity we have. So, we closely monitor that so that as we do see upticks, we can then quickly reassess and adjust our spending accordingly."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin.\nMelissa Poole: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company second quarter 2021 earnings Q&A session.

Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck, and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. \nAndrew Lazar: Good morning, everybody.\nMichele Buck: Good morning, Andrew.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Hi. First off, I guess, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the cost to serve dynamic that you talk about in the prepared remark. I guess, it should not come as a surprise that 15% organic sales growth in a given quarter would kind of stress any supply chain, no matter how efficient. So, my question is, I guess, are there any structural investments needed in the supply chain going forward or any capabilities that were exposed by the volume spike? Or is it simply -- you sort of suck up the higher costs, as they\u2019re transitory, particularly the labor part, and not need to necessarily make any changes, as that sort of volume growth is really not likely sustainable at these extreme elevated levels.\nMichele Buck: So, Andrew, let me start, and then let me ask Steve to give some more details. I would say at the highest level, there are certainly key parts of our portfolio that have had just extraordinary growth, and we cited some of the numbers, for example, on Reese\u2019s. So, one thing that we are very focused on is investigating capacity behind the brands and businesses that we know have demonstrated track records of strong growth over time and particularly where we've seen strong spikes that we think will have continued strength going forward. Let me have Steve talk a little bit more about some of the other elements of cost and cost to serve.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. I would add on the structural side, one of the benefits is we\u2019ve been working on our supply chain 2.0 program and the Annville fulfillment center comes online later this year, that\u2019ll provide some additional flexibility and agility, so that will certainly be helpful. As Michele said, continuing to invest where we need to on capacity, especially on those fast-growing core brands like Reese. From a cost standpoint and getting into some of the pieces, clearly like you said, Andrew, putting that much pressure on the supply chain at one time pushed us in a number of spots. It pushed us from an overtime standpoint; it pushed us from getting to contract manufacturers and expanding some of their work off an onsite contract rate, and the same on the freight and warehousing side. So, I look at those as pressure points in particular on top of that, or as the result of the higher volumes. And then in addition, I would say labor rates in general and labor availability in general are a pressure point, beyond just volume. The market for labor is challenging, and so just like everyone, we want to make sure we are staying ahead of the curve on hiring, making sure our value proposition at our plants is attractive, and packaging inflation is similar. Packaging inflation we touched on a little bit on the last call. It\u2019s still a pressure point. I think we\u2019re still optimistic we\u2019re going to see that moderate as we go forward, but we haven\u2019t seen it yet. So, it is a combination of those transitory costs on the back of the higher volume, and a few things that are a little bit more sticky here as we look across the balance of the year.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks for that. And then, just using our back of the envelope math, it seems like the operating profit upside in the quarter maybe is roughly offset in equal parts by a higher full year tax rate and some of the higher costs that you\u2019ve talked about just now sort of leaving the full year EPS guidance intact. I just wanted to see if I had the magnitude of each of those impacts for the full year more or less right. It seems like they\u2019re of equal magnitude essentially.\nSteve Voskuil: No, I would look at it as the tax piece was by far the biggest impact on us not taking up our earnings guidance alongside the top line. I think if it wasn\u2019t for the tax piece, we would\u2019ve raised guidance. The cost to serve is a component, but think of that as the 10% or the 15% of the impact where the majority really was the tax impact in the quarter.\nAndrew Lazar: Really helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thanks. Steve, you mentioned that there\u2019s 130 basis point tailwind from inventory loading this quarter, and you said there\u2019ll be a deload in the back half. Two questions on this. First, what\u2019s your best estimate for how large the inventory reduction will be at retail in the back half?  Number two, I know it\u2019s not always easy to forecast this, but how should we think about the cadence of that? Is the majority in the third quarter, or the fourth quarter, just for modeling purposes?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. I think in terms of total magnitude for the back half, I think 1.5 to two points of impact. And I would -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019re clever enough to give you the precise quarter. I would say I\u2019d look at it across both quarters, maybe a little bit of skew to the fourth quarter.\nKen Goldman: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, I think it\u2019s fair to say there\u2019s some frustration among investors this morning that you didn\u2019t raise your EPS guidance. I recognize the $0.04 beat wasn\u2019t huge in the second quarter. There\u2019s some uncertainty around the world in the back half of the year, but your business is doing great. So, I\u2019m just curious, internally, was there any consideration of raising the bottom line guidance, or did you just feel it\u2019s a little early given some of the inflation and the macro risks?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. I think, again, but for the tax piece, we would\u2019ve risen or taken up our guidance. Certainly, there\u2019s caution in the back half relative to the inflation and cost to serve. I think we have our hands around what that looks like and have a pretty good bead on that. But if that were the only piece, we would\u2019ve taken up our guidance, but tax was really the piece that we had to take into account. And we want to make sure we\u2019re not sacrificing investment in the back half of the year.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. For perspective, tax was $0.17 on EPS, so very meaningful.\nKen Goldman: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thanks for the question. What do you think about the tax rate going forward for 2022, Steve? This looks like a one-time impact, so do you think you\u2019ll have an easy comp in 2022? And then secondly, you talk about some of the cost elements; some are structural, maybe some are short-term. Does any of this impact how you\u2019re thinking about pricing going forward for this year and for 2022?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. On the tax side, we look at it as a one-off, so if we were to reset next year -- and again, we\u2019ll talk a lot more later in the year about 2022. But as a starting point, we wouldn\u2019t factor this into the starting point for 2022. So, I hope that\u2019s helpful. And then from a pricing standpoint, and Michele can add on here, pricing is a key part of our strategy, maintaining and growing, our gross margin is a key part of our strategy. I\u2019d say we execute against the trend. We are very aware of the dynamics at play from an inflation standpoint and so on, what competitors are doing, what retailers are doing. So, we are evaluating that environment all the time. And as always, we\u2019re not going to kind of tip our hand as we think through it, but pricing is and will remain a key part of our strategy going forward.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. As you recall, we did take two different price increases earlier this year on our confection portfolio that will really just begin flowing through in the second half of the year. And we\u2019ll also have some upside from that in the first half of next year.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. All right. Well, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Hi, there. I guess, the first question is whether you can give us any thoughts on the gross margin outlook from here. Obviously, a lot of other companies are seeing an awful lot of pressure. I remember back in 2018 when there was freight cost inflation. I think you also saw some pressure. Input costs are going up, packaging costs are going up, and yet you held it pretty flat this time around. So, just some thoughts on that, and then I have a follow-up.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yeah. We were pleased with the Q2 gross margin. We were -- it was a little bit ahead of our plan, I think we managed it well, and of course, implied inside our guidance for the balance of the year is a little softening of the gross margin outlook from being up slightly to being in line with last year. And I think that performance in the face of the inflation that we\u2019ve seen would be good. But our goal, again, looking to next year, building on the last question a little bit, is we want to continue to grow gross margin over time. And we want to do that through a pricing strategy. We want to do that through productivity. We want to do that through all the levers to manage inflation and commodity cost, and so driving that forward remains an important goal. We\u2019ll give more color on next year\u2019s gross margin as we get closer to the end of the year, but that goal remains firmly in our mind.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. Great. And then just a question on the Lily's acquisition. You recently sold Scharffen Berger and DAGOBA. The company\u2019s been trying to make premium work for quite some time. What\u2019s the difference about Lily's that makes you confident that you can actually make this work this time, versus some of the problems that you\u2019ve had in the past? Thank you. And I\u2019ll pass it on.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. What we really like about Lily's is, it is a scale business, so it is close to that $100 million in size, whereas Scharffen Berger and DAGOBA were much smaller, in the $30 million range. And we\u2019ve found over time, and I think we\u2019ve shared this before that for us, a good acquisition being around close to that $100 million mark has been built enough that we can really best apply our capabilities around distribution, manufacturing, synergies, additional marketing, kind of more broad-based marketing, et cetera, to really help to make the acquisition a success. The other thing I would say is Lily\u2019s is single mindedly focused on better-for-you. So, while it is premium, it has a very distinct understandable benefit that those consumers understand, which is about the lack of sugar. That also gives us a lot of confidence that it fits very neatly into our operating model. As you know, we have already launched a broader portfolio of better-for-you on our core brands, and so that whole better-for-you area is a big point of focus for us. And there\u2019s some nice synergy in terms of our focus there.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: Just curious how you think about elasticity, and I know it can hard to measure. The ways we\u2019ve tried to come at it, you tend to score quite well. Does that -- is that your sense as well? And how do you think about that in terms of your pricing? How aggressive you may try to be or not be, and just how you anticipate the consumer response to that?\nMichele Buck: Yes. We have seen -- we have very complex and sophisticated price elasticity models where we look not only at price points within our own categories, price gaps, price thresholds, also around other snack items as well. I think over time, I think we\u2019ve consistently seen that our business, our brands and our category tend to be on the less elastic side versus perhaps some other categories, which is what gives us confidence in pricing power and the ability to take price when we feel it is the right time.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just a follow-up on Reese's. Can you give a sense for the organic Reese's launch, just how that might be tracking versus your expectations, and maybe a little bit of how it compares from a margin perspective? It looks like, with its price point, it\u2019s probably pretty nicely accretive. Is that directionally correct?\nMichele Buck: So, it is performing in line with our expectations. It is early days, but it\u2019s absolutely in line with what we expected. It is really in kind of a test-and-learn phase as we move forward. And it\u2019s not, I would say, a big material piece of our better-for-you launch at this point in time, as organic is a little bit more of a targeted offering than say, zero sugar or sugar free.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. And to your second part of your question, from a margin perspective, we do charge a higher price point for it. But it also does cost more, obviously, so the margins are comparable to the core.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Zaslow with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Zaslow: Hi. Good morning, everyone. I had just two quick questions. One is the tax, is it a cash item or a non-cash item? And then the second thing I\u2019ll ask is, implicitly, you\u2019re actually raising the EBITDA, which is more cash oriented. Am I not understanding it correctly?\nSteve Voskuil: So, the first question is for the second quarter, it\u2019s non-cash, but a portion will become or could become cash in the balance of the year, and that portion will probably be non-cash for the balance of the year, so it is a mix of both for the balance of the year. On your second question, yes, you\u2019re thinking about it the right way from an EBITDA standpoint.\nKen Zaslow: Okay. And then just to follow-up on this. The magnitude of the increase on the EBITDA exceeds the amount of cash that will be needed to pay the taxes. Is that a fair way? And then I\u2019ll leave it there. I just want to make sure I understand the tax, because it just seems like it\u2019s more -- if cash flow is actually coming up, not going down, based on what you\u2019re saying. I just want to make I\u2019m understanding it correctly.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, that\u2019s true, but I\u2019d say the caveat is time. All right. So, if you\u2019re looking at a longer period of time, it\u2019s more possible that a portion of that reserve could become cash. And so, if you\u2019re looking at next quarter or the balance of the year, that might lead to one answer. If you\u2019re looking at the next two years, it could be a different answer.\nKen Zaslow: Great. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nBryan Spillane: Hi. So, I guess, I wanted to maybe follow-up a little bit on Andrew\u2019s questioning at the beginning. And Michele, maybe just stepping back a little bit, this -- in this environment, right, where we\u2019re seeing not just higher cost inflation, but in addition to that, what\u2019s effectively labor shortages, right, and we\u2019ve seen this across a lot of the companies in our coverage universe. So, I guess, I had two questions related to that. One is, if supply chains are kind of running all out, just how you think about stimulating demand when there\u2019s some challenges just in terms of getting product on the shelf? And I guess the second is just, as you step back and you look at all these different dynamics in the economy and the environment in general, it\u2019s definitely a situation that is in some ways unique. Your perspective, have you seen some of this before? And maybe just how you\u2019re thinking about approaching planning for the business over the next, I don\u2019t know, 12 to 24 months, if we continue to be in this type of environment.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. It\u2019s certainly something that we spend a lot of time, thinking about and working on. And I guess what I would say is, yeah, we do realize that it is somewhat of a volatile time still, certainly with all the talk of the Delta variant and recent CDC guidance recently. It\u2019s all too much of a reminder that we clearly aren\u2019t fully out of the pandemic. And I personally believe, in September, we know that a lot of companies are implementing kind of a return to office. It seems like a lot of companies are doing that then. Kids going back to school. So, there will be more for all of us to learn about consumer behaviors and what some of those changes mean for that. The way that we think about the supply chain and managing where we are right now is, I guess in a couple ways. How do we maximize -- how do we efficiently maximize and profitably maximize revenue? And so, one of the key things we do focus on is really looking across the portfolio and focusing on really maxing out where we have available capacity and leaning into some of those brands and businesses with greater investment, reallocating investment to those businesses so that we can really take full advantage of that. If there are areas of the portfolio where we -- like a Reese, for example, I think we keep pointing out as an example because it\u2019s such a big piece of our business and growing at such a hefty rate. We have total confidence making big capacity investments on that one, just because of the track record and the dynamics around that. And then -- so we\u2019ll invest in capacity as a piece of that. And then there are parts of the portfolio where we\u2019re not going to lean in right away and invest in capacity, because we want things to play out a bit here more. So, we really leverage the breadth -- one of the strengths we have is the breadth of our portfolio. We\u2019ve got our seasonal portfolio with the consumable take home. We have a range of different brands. And so, we really try and leverage that as best possible to manage through. So, it\u2019s kind of a balance of investing to build supply chain even stronger, which we\u2019re always doing, but we\u2019re doing even more of that right now. Doing what we need now, kind of no regret move, and then planning for the future from a contingency perspective depending on what the potential outcomes are.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Thanks for that. If I could just follow-up with one quick one. Just as you\u2019ve sold in merchandising for holidays in the back half of the year and maybe just more in general, have service levels come up more as sort of a factor that retailers are focusing on? Like, you can sell a program or they can take a program, but are they more sensitive to actually planning to be in stock? Is that becoming more of sort of a factor in that decision-making right now?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. I mean, I would say absolutely. Retailers were under tremendous pressure this past year with all of the huge shifts that COVID caused on many manufacturers\u2019 businesses. They had, as we all know, tremendous issues with out-of-stocks. And so, their goal is to make sure they remain in stock. In fact, right now, we\u2019ve seen retailers really lean in a bit to inventory and carry a bit more inventory than they have in the past, because I think there\u2019s a little bit of a scarcity mentality. They want to make sure they have product. They also know that manufacturers are taking price, and so in some cases it may allow them to hedge a little bit there. So, I think it is definitely a focal area and, of course, something that we always focus on and are proud of how we\u2019ve been able to deliver for retailers. They\u2019ve continued to come to us, given how we were able to deliver during the worst of the pandemic last year, and have continued to rely on us this year.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Thanks, Michele.\nMichele Buck: Absolutely.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It seems there are no other questions at this time. I\u2019ll turn the floor back to Ms. Poole for any final comments.\nMelissa Poole: Thank you for joining us this morning. I\u2019ll be available throughout the day for any other follow-up questions you may have.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

            "content": "Good morning, Andrew. So, Andrew, let me start, and then let me ask Steve to give some more details. I would say at the highest level, there are certainly key parts of our portfolio that have had just extraordinary growth, and we cited some of the numbers, for example, on Reese's. So, one thing that we are very focused on is investigating capacity behind the brands and businesses that we know have demonstrated track records of strong growth over time and particularly where we've seen strong spikes that we think will have continued strength going forward. Let me have Steve talk a little bit more about some of the other elements of cost and cost to serve. Yeah. For perspective, tax was $0.17 on EPS, so very meaningful. Yeah. As you recall, we did take two different price increases earlier this year on our confection portfolio that will really just begin flowing through in the second half of the year. And we'll also have some upside from that in the first half of next year. Good morning. Yeah. What we really like about Lily's is, it is a scale business, so it is close to that $100 million in size, whereas Scharffen Berger and DAGOBA were much smaller, in the $30 million range. And we've found over time, and I think we've shared this before that for us, a good acquisition being around close to that $100 million mark has been built enough that we can really best apply our capabilities around distribution, manufacturing, synergies, additional marketing, kind of more broad-based marketing, et cetera, to really help to make the acquisition a success. The other thing I would say is Lily's is single mindedly focused on better-for-you. So, while it is premium, it has a very distinct understandable benefit that those consumers understand, which is about the lack of sugar. That also gives us a lot of confidence that it fits very neatly into our operating model. As you know, we have already launched a broader portfolio of better-for-you on our core brands, and so that whole better-for-you area is a big point of focus for us. And there's some nice synergy in terms of our focus there. Good morning. Yes. We have seen -- we have very complex and sophisticated price elasticity models where we look not only at price points within our own categories, price gaps, price thresholds, also around other snack items as well. I think over time, I think we've consistently seen that our business, our brands and our category tend to be on the less elastic side versus perhaps some other categories, which is what gives us confidence in pricing power and the ability to take price when we feel it is the right time. So, it is performing in line with our expectations. It is early days, but it's absolutely in line with what we expected. It is really in kind of a test-and-learn phase as we move forward. And it's not, I would say, a big material piece of our better-for-you launch at this point in time, as organic is a little bit more of a targeted offering than say, zero sugar or sugar free. Yeah. And to your second part of your question, from a margin perspective, we do charge a higher price point for it. But it also does cost more, obviously, so the margins are comparable to the core. Good morning. Yeah. It's certainly something that we spend a lot of time, thinking about and working on. And I guess what I would say is, yeah, we do realize that it is somewhat of a volatile time still, certainly with all the talk of the Delta variant and recent CDC guidance recently. It's all too much of a reminder that we clearly aren't fully out of the pandemic. And I personally believe, in September, we know that a lot of companies are implementing kind of a return to office. It seems like a lot of companies are doing that then. Kids going back to school. So, there will be more for all of us to learn about consumer behaviors and what some of those changes mean for that. The way that we think about the supply chain and managing where we are right now is, I guess in a couple ways. How do we maximize -- how do we efficiently maximize and profitably maximize revenue? And so, one of the key things we do focus on is really looking across the portfolio and focusing on really maxing out where we have available capacity and leaning into some of those brands and businesses with greater investment, reallocating investment to those businesses so that we can really take full advantage of that. If there are areas of the portfolio where we -- like a Reese, for example, I think we keep pointing out as an example because it's such a big piece of our business and growing at such a hefty rate. We have total confidence making big capacity investments on that one, just because of the track record and the dynamics around that. And then -- so we'll invest in capacity as a piece of that. And then there are parts of the portfolio where we're not going to lean in right away and invest in capacity, because we want things to play out a bit here more. So, we really leverage the breadth -- one of the strengths we have is the breadth of our portfolio. We've got our seasonal portfolio with the consumable take home. We have a range of different brands. And so, we really try and leverage that as best possible to manage through. So, it's kind of a balance of investing to build supply chain even stronger, which we're always doing, but we're doing even more of that right now. Doing what we need now, kind of no regret move, and then planning for the future from a contingency perspective depending on what the potential outcomes are. Yeah. I mean, I would say absolutely. Retailers were under tremendous pressure this past year with all of the huge shifts that COVID caused on many manufacturers' businesses. They had, as we all know, tremendous issues with out-of-stocks. And so, their goal is to make sure they remain in stock. In fact, right now, we've seen retailers really lean in a bit to inventory and carry a bit more inventory than they have in the past, because I think there's a little bit of a scarcity mentality. They want to make sure they have product. They also know that manufacturers are taking price, and so in some cases it may allow them to hedge a little bit there. So, I think it is definitely a focal area and, of course, something that we always focus on and are proud of how we've been able to deliver for retailers. They've continued to come to us, given how we were able to deliver during the worst of the pandemic last year, and have continued to rely on us this year. Absolutely."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for the Hershey Company. Thank you. You may now begin.\nMelissa Poole: Thanks, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the Hershey Company's first quarter 2021 earnings Q&A Session.

Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thank you for the question and obviously, really great results. I just wanted to get a little more color on your gross margin expectations for the year. You talked about transitory reasons for why gross margin would be down in first quarter. And I think \u2013 are you still guiding to gross margin expansion? And to what extent do you need like the incremental pricing to get that gross margin to turn the other way? And I would think some of these higher costs that you're talking about, like freight co-packing, it sounds like you'll need to keep doing those things beyond just first quarter, maybe a little more color there.\nMichele Buck: So let me have Steve take that one.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Happy to. So yes, we are still calling for modest gross margin expansion on a full year basis. As you noted and we had in the remarks, there were some transitory impacts in the first quarter, some lapping from last year, some also cost in response to the higher volume. As we look forward for the rest of the year, some of the things that are strengths for us, the productivity gains, the additional volume, the pricing that you referenced, all of that will be part of building that gross margin. So far, for the first quarter and even as we look out for the year, I would say our inflation assumptions are largely tracking to what we had in plan, and the one exception that we noted was packaging. And I think that is one we'll watch. Our expectation is that inflation will moderate some as the year plays out, impacted a bit by weather in Texas for the first quarter. So that's one we're watching, and then in any carry forward of incremental cost to support the higher volume. And with more runway here in the balance of the year, we'll have more opportunities to optimize between customer service and manufacturing capacity and the cost of support. So we're keeping a close watch on all those. But yes, at this point, we still see some gross margin expansion over the course of the year.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And one follow-up. The new price increase on grocery and non-chocolate, can you give us a sense of what it presents both in absolute terms and also on an annualized basis once its fully flows through?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. So we see it total pricing for this year across all the price increases, order of magnitude about 100 basis points, about half of that is the non-chocolate piece. And again, reference there is we haven't priced that part of the portfolio since 2014. So this is in line with our broader strategy. We've talked about of rotating and refreshing pricing in parts of the portfolio.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. So on an annualized basis, does that mean it's 1%, 2% to the total business? Or\u2026\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, annualized, it's about a point for this year. It's about 50 basis points.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.\nMichael Lavery: Good morning. Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: Just following on pricing a little bit. You said the 1 point to 1.5 on expectations for the year. And I mentioned that a lot of that reflects the pricing you just took and some of the promotional benefit in the first quarter. You also just mentioned that the packaging inflation should moderate. You've got some relatively benign things like cocoa costs and dairy at least so far. But if you were to look for more pricing, say, if packaging didn't come in the way you're expecting, how nimble can you be? And what sort of timing does it take to flow some of this through? How much upside to the 1 to 1.5, could we end up seeing?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. It depends on which parts of the portfolio that we would price. Obviously, the seasonal part takes a pretty long lead time. And so really, that's not something that would be in the card for this year. On an everyday basis, we probably need at least three to four months of lead time. And so you could say there's still some optionality there, if we were to see some worst case scenarios from a cost standpoint. Right now, that's not in the plan. I think we feel good about the plan that we have for pricing. But as I said, we'll monitor what's happening from a cost standpoint.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's great. Thanks. And just a follow-up on the e-commerce side. I believe you've said that those margins might be somewhere around 100 to 150 basis points lower, but as it scales, that should improve. How have you seen that change over this past year with the benefit of the surge and obviously, a bigger scale base now?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. From a dilution standpoint, I mean, you're in the right ZIP code. It's a bit dilutive to the overall margin. Obviously, that piece of the business, as we've talked about in prior calls, has gotten bigger. But at the same time, we continue to look for ways to drive efficiency there and optimize inside that business to bring those margins closer in line with the rest of the portfolio.\nMichael Lavery: Do you have a sense of just the timing for what that might take? Is that a multiyear process? Or would some of this surge that's kind of still sticking now would be a big help towards narrowing that gap?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. It's a multiyear process for sure. I mean, the scale does help. We get more scale across some of the investments and capabilities that we put there. So there is some benefit there in the present, but really to address the full dilution, it's going to be a multiyear process.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is coming from the line of Nik Modi with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.\nNik Modi: Yes. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had two questions. First is on just shelf space. So clearly, Hershey has done a phenomenal job on execution, gains in 2020, gains in early 2021. I'm just curious given how your momentum continues, if you would expect to see or have discussions with retailers, providing more space later this year, but also in 2022? That's the first question. And then the second question is just on \u2013 given the online momentum that you've been seeing and the clear stickiness that we've seen, how are you thinking about the supply chain and kind of reorienting the supply chain to make sure that you can continue to effectively execute as the online business continues to grow? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Good morning, Nik. So let me first go to the space question. As we started out for the year, we always have a focused plan, focused on balanced growth across all levers, driving base velocity, using media to accelerate growth, growth in seasons, distribution gains. So that's always a focus for us. And we are fortunate that we have been able, given the strength of our performance of our supply chain, particularly overall, but also during COVID and some of the needs of our customers to be able to provide some incremental SKUs that were very viable, that our customers were looking for, and we gained about five incremental SKUs for the year. And so certainly, with that comes some shelf space gains. So that's something we've been focused on. As we get that distribution and we get shelf space now, that certainly has some staying power as long as those SKUs perform, which we anticipate that they will. So we are continuing to be focused on that. And as we look throughout the year, believe, we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to drive distribution as well as shelf space gains. And certainly, that kind of coincides with some of the share gains that we have seen on the business have been driven by that. As we look at online momentum as it relates to our supply chain, we've talked before about Supply Chain 2.0, a big initiative that we have to really prepare our business and enable our manufacturing and supply chain for the future. And certainly, as we build that program and that initiative, one of the key legs that we were focused on was the agility to enable us to adapt to the changing retail environment and specifically, e-commerce being one of those areas, because a lot of the packs sold in e-commerce are slightly different than those sold across the business. So some of those investments that we're making there enable us to more efficiently at a better margin, develop the right packs that enable us to win in e-commerce. So big focus in Supply Chain 2.0 against that and in all of our new capacity builds.\nNik Modi: Thanks. Thank you, Michele.\nMichele Buck: Sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nJason English: Hey. Good morning, folks. Thank you for sliding me in. I want to come back to the question on pricing, but from a slightly different angle. Michele, if we look back in history, usually, you move Mars follows or Mars moves, you follow, and you follow a similar order of magnitude on similar products. And that consistency has obviously helped investors build confidence in the pricing architecture, the pricing discipline or the pricing power in the category. We're in a bit of a unique circumstance right now where Mars is moving one direction with a higher magnitude, and you're moving in a different direction with a much lower magnitude. And it strikes me is quite a unique moment in time where you guys are diverging. I guess I love a little more clarity to try to understand the motivation for you to go in a different direction? And what if any implications this may have in terms of that pricing discipline we've historically seen in the category?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So I continue to feel really good about this being a very rational category from a pricing perspective and there being strong discipline from that perspective. Our recent announcements regarding increasing price on seasons and also non chocolate and grocery are very consistent with the strategy we've been executing over the past couple of years of realizing price through different levers and on different parts of the portfolio. And we think that, that's proven effective for us to drive profitable growth and also be able to reinvest in the business, both for us and also for our retailers. But we do know that across competitors in the category, we each do have unique portfolios with different SKUs to our business across pack types and across brands, we have some different capabilities in terms of what we are good at executing and perhaps even different business needs at different points in time. And so while all the pricing isn't exactly pack-to-pack, exactly the same, what we think is important is while those tactics and products might differ, overall, category price realization is pretty consistent. And so if you look at us and you look at the largest player in the second largest player in the category, the magnitude and difference in terms of what we each are getting from price is probably a point or in that range. So it's a significant \u2013 it's not a significant difference between.\nJason English: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. You highlighted some recurring headwinds to your gross margin. I think there were some incentive payments, so comment on warehousing costs. Is there any color, Steve that you can provide on how much these may have added to your COGS or just took away from your margin? And do any of those incentive payments bleed into 2Q?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. So maybe just taking the incentive piece. So yes, we will see some additional incentives that I go versus prior in second quarter as well. As we get to the back half of the year, it's going to get a little bit narrower year-on-year. And so \u2013 but we'll definitely see some impact in the second quarter. We also have some year-over-year investments in capabilities. I think we touched on these a little bit in our last call, still some costs going through OpEx to support Supply Chain 2.0 that Michele mentioned and also the ERP program. So those would be, if I kind of look between the lines, some of the pieces year-over-year, that will be different.\nKen Goldman: Okay. And then as my follow-up, I may be pushing you a little harder than what you're willing to talk about, but it's hard not to notice that COCO, it was of the only commodities that hasn't retired lately, has come down actually sequentially in the last couple of months. So I know you don't talk about your specific commodity buys. But can you just walk us through a little bit about how you're looking to lock in maybe some of your favorable inputs a bit longer than you otherwise might have, just given how everything else has risen so much higher? It really could help you in terms of protecting your 2022 numbers at this point?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yes. I mean, you're right, Ken, we're not going to get too specific. Our hedging horizons vary. We kind of said in the past three months up to two years, depending on what's available on the market, liquidity, pricing, and I will say our commodities team is very good at interpreting the signals and trying to make smart moves with respect to that hedging program. Beyond that, we're probably not going to comment and said cocoa's moved around. It's down a little bit. I'll like you might interpret that as some opportunity if you were to be a little bit longer from a hedging standpoint, but we really don't want to say any more than that yet about 22.\nKen Goldman: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone. Hope you can hear me okay?\nMichele Buck: Yes, we can.\nAlexia Howard: Perfect. Okay. So I guess my first question is, I wonder if you can give us a little bit more detail and granularity around the away-from-home recovery, particularly in North America. Which regions, which channels, what exactly is playing out there that you're seeing that's so encouraging? And then my second follow-up question, I know you're not giving quarterly guidance, but obviously, 2020 was such an unusual year. And we're going to be lapping some interesting developments in the year ago period as we go into Q2. I think you mentioned the ad spend was going to be up materially in the second quarter. I'm just wondering whether you can give us any other pointers on how the top and the bottom line might be expected to develop? Or what the pluses and minuses are as we think about next quarter? Thank you. And I'll pass it on.\nMichele Buck: Sure. So relative to the away-from-home strength, I would say it is across the board. So first of all, we did see stronger foot traffic and consumer mobility in North America, and that was really, I believe, from the accelerated vaccine distribution as well as from the stimulus funds that were allocated and that not only drove strength in what we would call our core channels, kind of the more traditional channel, food, drug mass and even some pickup in convenience in Q1. It also had \u2013 there was also a very strong positive impact on our non-measured channels as well. So, food service, our own retail stores in a world travel retail some of those businesses that were really big decliners for us last year came faster than we anticipated. So I would say, it was pretty much across the board in terms of all of those venues improving a bit more than we had anticipated. So, some of it was due to the consumer traffic. And then, of course, we were able to also capture incremental distribution and merchandising in our US confection business. And given the strong sell-through that we saw, driven by mobility and foot traffic, strong sell-through Easter then led to accelerated shipments of some of our summer programs, which also helped us across the board. And then even beyond North America, we actually saw increased mobility in the international markets as well, a bit more than we had expected. So with that, I think those were unplanned for us in Q1. We certainly had planned to see those mobility improvements later in the year and have that in our plan, but not in Q1. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to talk a little bit about the quarters.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. From a quarterly standpoint, as we look at Q2, building on what Michele said, we've got a lot of momentum on the top line coming into Q2. We're able to merchandise early. Some of the summer season, that will get us off to a \u2013 to a strong start. As we go forward from there on the top line, you're going to see sales growth moderate. The last get tougher. You'll see pricing start to make a contribution more in the back half. And as Michelle said, our plan assumed mobility would begin to recover as we got to the back half. So that's less of a new piece of the story as we turn the corner on the midyear. And then we'll see some margin improvement as the year progresses. You mentioned ad spending for Q2. It's going to be up pretty big. Year-over-year, that was \u2013 the quarter last year where we made some adjustments, some pricing advantage because it was cheaper to buy and some pricing or some adjustments in how much we spent just in response to COVID. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the balance of the quarter.\nAlexia Howard: Very helpful. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning, everybody.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Michele, I know this can be a little hard to parse out sometimes. But as you think about how much of the gains that you've made the last couple of quarters, right, in distribution and shelf space, merchandising gains you've talked about, how do you think about like how much of those might be structural, right, based on a lot of the \u2013 the good stuff that you're doing around innovation and everything else versus a product of what's been clearly a more accommodative sort of competitive environment from a perspective of some others, whether it be supply chain missteps and things of that nature? So I'm just trying to get a sense, it's a hard one to answer, I know, but how sticky do you think some of those gains in market, right, that you've seen can be over time?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So I think you're right. It is a little bit tough to parse all of that out. So I would say we came into the year feeling really good about our strategies. And many of those we have laid out pre-COVID relative to really focused on we got to win at the top line with balanced growth, which is driving against distribution, the core innovation, seasons, pricing and volume growth. And I think what we're seeing on the business is that we are delivering on each of those elements. And so certainly, that is a piece that I think has staying power that some of the strategies we put in place relative to pre-COVID optimizing our balanced focus on the core and on innovation, not over rotating on innovation too much. Not over rotating on any one factor, balancing price volume, one of those things. So I think that there is some underlying strength there as well as a lot of the investments that we've made in our core capabilities in our manufacturing and our supply chain over the year that have enabled us to deliver perhaps at stronger levels than perhaps some others in the marketplace. And so some of that strength that we're seeing in terms of impact of media, those types of things, they're there without the COVID impact. We tend to always, as you know, strong category managers. So we do tend to do well when it comes to winning at retail. We have our proprietary retail sales force that enable us to do that. At the same time, I say, I guess, if I was going to parse out some places where some of the current dynamics maybe a little bit more transitory. Certainly, we have one more distribution than, I would say, it's probably at the historic level in terms of number of new items, because of our strength in being able to operate in this environment and our agility, we have won some incremental march [ph] associated with the competitive situation as well. So for me, I guess, I kind of \u2013 I narrow into probably those two factors being probably the biggest ones that are the most unique. And of course, the other one is that right now in Q1, you asked more about a couple of quarters, in Q1, in particular, we've kind of got that unique duality where we're seeing that we're benefiting both from away-from-home and from at-home behaviors, both being strong. And certainly, I think that, that can't sustain at the level that it did in Q1. So we do think that, that's going to moderate a bit. Does that help yes.\nAndrew Lazar: Yes. That's very helpful. It will be really interesting to see how much of the at-home moderates as mobility does return for the industry as a whole, obviously, it will be really interesting. But I hear your point about how strong both of those really were at the same time in Q1. So yes, that's very helpful. Thanks so much.\nMichele Buck: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is coming from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. I just wanted to touch on the international segment for a minute. I mean, obviously, performance in Q1 extremely strong. I think originally, right, the expectation was essentially for somewhat modest growth. Guidance now is up for the full year for the total company. And then I know you had comments in your prepared remarks just around basically playing it safe, right? There's some incremental lockdowns occurring, the visibility is that strong. But I guess kind of overall, the question is, could it be actually a lot stronger, right, than we would expect as we go through the year? Because it would seem as if kind of relative to what we're thinking about for North America, is that international piece does continue to play out. And obviously, given those compares are so much easier, it would seem as if the volume-driven year could actually be even more volume-driven off of that international piece as we progress through the year. So kind of simplistically, I'm just asking, I realize you don't have the visibility, but if things were to kind of self-correct and momentum were to continue in international, I mean, could you just not do much better on the top line than you're already currently guiding? That's all. Thanks.\nMichele Buck: First of all, I'd say, hey, we feel great that we are seeing strength across every piece of our business. In North America, in every component of North America, including US confection and amplify as well as in international. So that's great to see. And certainly, we did have a strong first quarter in international that was significantly ahead of our expectation. I think what was interesting for us was that despite this fact that COVID cases were high in many of those markets, consumer mobility still increased, and that drove demand for our category that was stronger than we anticipated. I think the potential concern and certainly, as you look at the news, you see this everywhere is there certainly are some pretty dire situations, especially in some of the markets that we're in, but certainly, India being one of those, where case counts are rising. There are other markets where the vaccination dissemination is going quite slowly. And as new lockdowns are implemented, we expect that those could hamper mobility and that these trends could moderate. So we know international, things are always volatile, but they certainly are even more volatile during this time. And those markets are not going to have linear behavior. So we expect that we'll see continued volatility. What we're trying to do is to drive what's within our control, and our teams are responding with tremendous agility in adapting the plans based on the stages and the status in each market. So we feel good that all of our key initiatives, whether it's our China transition to the new business model, a restart or upping again our focus in India on our chocolate initiative, all of those things are going well. But there's just a lot outside of our control, and we'll have to see how the year plays out. If things are positive, certainly, there could be upside. And \u2013 however, we also know that there could be downside as well.\nRob Dickerson: All right. Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Morgan Fletcher with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nMorgan Fletcher: Hi, good morning. Thank you for the question.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nMorgan Fletcher: So I guess my question is on how COVID may have changed your perspective on the portfolio maybe in inorganic, but also an inorganic way? We touched on e-commerce and supply chain earlier, but maybe if we could just go through more how you're looking at categories differently? Like baking mix has had very strong growth, while refreshments have seen decline. So just how you may be thinking about your portfolio on a category basis going forward? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think one of the things that we feel good about that COVID just reinforced was the strength of the breadth of our portfolio to be able to participate in different occasions. And so I would start first within core confections and say, we have a \u2013 our business splits a-third, a-third, a-third, instant consumables, which are all about people being out and about on the go; take home, which is all about people being at home and consuming the products there; and then seasons, which is all about celebrations. And so within confection, what we saw was, wow, normally, we might focus a bit more of our efforts on instant consumable. And when COVID hit, we were able to immediately shift media, in store merchandising, et cetera, more to our take-home portfolio. And we also saw that during a time like COVID, consumers were just hungry for connection and so the roles that our brands play during season to create that connectivity and traditions and rituals with something consumers just were so hungry for. So really leveraging the full breadth of that within confection was important. You raised baking and certainly, consumers were baking more, and we were able to leverage that as part of our portfolio. So I think what it really taught us was this ability to pivot to follow the consumer and to focus on the parts of our portfolio that were most relevant to them at that time. And as I think \u2013 if we think organic and inorganic likewise, we were able to take advantage of SkinnyPop which has done incredibly well during COVID. And certainly, we know that category like nutrition bars haven't done quite as well. So it's really playing on the pieces of your portfolio at the right piece of time, but having the options and the breadth across the portfolio to be able to meet those needs.\nMorgan Fletcher: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Michele Buck for closing remarks.\nMichele Buck: I'll turn it over to Melissa for closing remarks.\nMelissa Poole: Thank you for joining us this morning. I know, it's a busy day of earnings. As always, I will be available to answer any additional questions you may have. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Steve Voskuil",
            "content": "Sure. Happy to. So yes, we are still calling for modest gross margin expansion on a full year basis. As you noted and we had in the remarks, there were some transitory impacts in the first quarter, some lapping from last year, some also cost in response to the higher volume. As we look forward for the rest of the year, some of the things that are strengths for us, the productivity gains, the additional volume, the pricing that you referenced, all of that will be part of building that gross margin. So far, for the first quarter and even as we look out for the year, I would say our inflation assumptions are largely tracking to what we had in plan, and the one exception that we noted was packaging. And I think that is one we'll watch. Our expectation is that inflation will moderate some as the year plays out, impacted a bit by weather in Texas for the first quarter. So that's one we're watching, and then in any carry forward of incremental cost to support the higher volume. And with more runway here in the balance of the year, we'll have more opportunities to optimize between customer service and manufacturing capacity and the cost of support. So we're keeping a close watch on all those. But yes, at this point, we still see some gross margin expansion over the course of the year. Yes. So we see it total pricing for this year across all the price increases, order of magnitude about 100 basis points, about half of that is the non-chocolate piece. And again, reference there is we haven't priced that part of the portfolio since 2014. So this is in line with our broader strategy. We've talked about of rotating and refreshing pricing in parts of the portfolio. Yes, annualized, it's about a point for this year. It's about 50 basis points. Yes. It depends on which parts of the portfolio that we would price. Obviously, the seasonal part takes a pretty long lead time. And so really, that's not something that would be in the card for this year. On an everyday basis, we probably need at least three to four months of lead time. And so you could say there's still some optionality there, if we were to see some worst case scenarios from a cost standpoint. Right now, that's not in the plan. I think we feel good about the plan that we have for pricing. But as I said, we'll monitor what's happening from a cost standpoint. Yes. From a dilution standpoint, I mean, you're in the right ZIP code. It's a bit dilutive to the overall margin. Obviously, that piece of the business, as we've talked about in prior calls, has gotten bigger. But at the same time, we continue to look for ways to drive efficiency there and optimize inside that business to bring those margins closer in line with the rest of the portfolio. Sure. It's a multiyear process for sure. I mean, the scale does help. We get more scale across some of the investments and capabilities that we put there. So there is some benefit there in the present, but really to address the full dilution, it's going to be a multiyear process. Yes. So maybe just taking the incentive piece. So yes, we will see some additional incentives that I go versus prior in second quarter as well. As we get to the back half of the year, it's going to get a little bit narrower year-on-year. And so \u2013 but we'll definitely see some impact in the second quarter. We also have some year-over-year investments in capabilities. I think we touched on these a little bit in our last call, still some costs going through OpEx to support Supply Chain 2.0 that Michele mentioned and also the ERP program. So those would be, if I kind of look between the lines, some of the pieces year-over-year, that will be different. Sure. Yes. I mean, you're right, Ken, we're not going to get too specific. Our hedging horizons vary. We kind of said in the past three months up to two years, depending on what's available on the market, liquidity, pricing, and I will say our commodities team is very good at interpreting the signals and trying to make smart moves with respect to that hedging program. Beyond that, we're probably not going to comment and said cocoa's moved around. It's down a little bit. I'll like you might interpret that as some opportunity if you were to be a little bit longer from a hedging standpoint, but we really don't want to say any more than that yet about 22. Yes. From a quarterly standpoint, as we look at Q2, building on what Michele said, we've got a lot of momentum on the top line coming into Q2. We're able to merchandise early. Some of the summer season, that will get us off to a \u2013 to a strong start. As we go forward from there on the top line, you're going to see sales growth moderate. The last get tougher. You'll see pricing start to make a contribution more in the back half. And as Michelle said, our plan assumed mobility would begin to recover as we got to the back half. So that's less of a new piece of the story as we turn the corner on the midyear. And then we'll see some margin improvement as the year progresses. You mentioned ad spending for Q2. It's going to be up pretty big. Year-over-year, that was \u2013 the quarter last year where we made some adjustments, some pricing advantage because it was cheaper to buy and some pricing or some adjustments in how much we spent just in response to COVID. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of color on the balance of the quarter. Good morning."

            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "So let me have Steve take that one. Good morning. Good morning, Nik. So let me first go to the space question. As we started out for the year, we always have a focused plan, focused on balanced growth across all levers, driving base velocity, using media to accelerate growth, growth in seasons, distribution gains. So that's always a focus for us. And we are fortunate that we have been able, given the strength of our performance of our supply chain, particularly overall, but also during COVID and some of the needs of our customers to be able to provide some incremental SKUs that were very viable, that our customers were looking for, and we gained about five incremental SKUs for the year. And so certainly, with that comes some shelf space gains. So that's something we've been focused on. As we get that distribution and we get shelf space now, that certainly has some staying power as long as those SKUs perform, which we anticipate that they will. So we are continuing to be focused on that. And as we look throughout the year, believe, we feel pretty good about our ability to continue to drive distribution as well as shelf space gains. And certainly, that kind of coincides with some of the share gains that we have seen on the business have been driven by that. As we look at online momentum as it relates to our supply chain, we've talked before about Supply Chain 2.0, a big initiative that we have to really prepare our business and enable our manufacturing and supply chain for the future. And certainly, as we build that program and that initiative, one of the key legs that we were focused on was the agility to enable us to adapt to the changing retail environment and specifically, e-commerce being one of those areas, because a lot of the packs sold in e-commerce are slightly different than those sold across the business. So some of those investments that we're making there enable us to more efficiently at a better margin, develop the right packs that enable us to win in e-commerce. So big focus in Supply Chain 2.0 against that and in all of our new capacity builds. Sure. Yes. So I continue to feel really good about this being a very rational category from a pricing perspective and there being strong discipline from that perspective. Our recent announcements regarding increasing price on seasons and also non chocolate and grocery are very consistent with the strategy we've been executing over the past couple of years of realizing price through different levers and on different parts of the portfolio. And we think that, that's proven effective for us to drive profitable growth and also be able to reinvest in the business, both for us and also for our retailers. But we do know that across competitors in the category, we each do have unique portfolios with different SKUs to our business across pack types and across brands, we have some different capabilities in terms of what we are good at executing and perhaps even different business needs at different points in time. And so while all the pricing isn't exactly pack-to-pack, exactly the same, what we think is important is while those tactics and products might differ, overall, category price realization is pretty consistent. And so if you look at us and you look at the largest player in the second largest player in the category, the magnitude and difference in terms of what we each are getting from price is probably a point or in that range. So it's a significant \u2013 it's not a significant difference between. Yes, we can. Sure. So relative to the away-from-home strength, I would say it is across the board. So first of all, we did see stronger foot traffic and consumer mobility in North America, and that was really, I believe, from the accelerated vaccine distribution as well as from the stimulus funds that were allocated and that not only drove strength in what we would call our core channels, kind of the more traditional channel, food, drug mass and even some pickup in convenience in Q1. It also had \u2013 there was also a very strong positive impact on our non-measured channels as well. So, food service, our own retail stores in a world travel retail some of those businesses that were really big decliners for us last year came faster than we anticipated. So I would say, it was pretty much across the board in terms of all of those venues improving a bit more than we had anticipated. So, some of it was due to the consumer traffic. And then, of course, we were able to also capture incremental distribution and merchandising in our US confection business. And given the strong sell-through that we saw, driven by mobility and foot traffic, strong sell-through Easter then led to accelerated shipments of some of our summer programs, which also helped us across the board. And then even beyond North America, we actually saw increased mobility in the international markets as well, a bit more than we had expected. So with that, I think those were unplanned for us in Q1. We certainly had planned to see those mobility improvements later in the year and have that in our plan, but not in Q1. And with that, I'll turn it over to Steve to talk a little bit about the quarters. Good morning. Yes. So I think you're right. It is a little bit tough to parse all of that out. So I would say we came into the year feeling really good about our strategies. And many of those we have laid out pre-COVID relative to really focused on we got to win at the top line with balanced growth, which is driving against distribution, the core innovation, seasons, pricing and volume growth. And I think what we're seeing on the business is that we are delivering on each of those elements. And so certainly, that is a piece that I think has staying power that some of the strategies we put in place relative to pre-COVID optimizing our balanced focus on the core and on innovation, not over rotating on innovation too much. Not over rotating on any one factor, balancing price volume, one of those things. So I think that there is some underlying strength there as well as a lot of the investments that we've made in our core capabilities in our manufacturing and our supply chain over the year that have enabled us to deliver perhaps at stronger levels than perhaps some others in the marketplace. And so some of that strength that we're seeing in terms of impact of media, those types of things, they're there without the COVID impact. We tend to always, as you know, strong category managers. So we do tend to do well when it comes to winning at retail. We have our proprietary retail sales force that enable us to do that. At the same time, I say, I guess, if I was going to parse out some places where some of the current dynamics maybe a little bit more transitory. Certainly, we have one more distribution than, I would say, it's probably at the historic level in terms of number of new items, because of our strength in being able to operate in this environment and our agility, we have won some incremental march [ph] associated with the competitive situation as well. So for me, I guess, I kind of \u2013 I narrow into probably those two factors being probably the biggest ones that are the most unique. And of course, the other one is that right now in Q1, you asked more about a couple of quarters, in Q1, in particular, we've kind of got that unique duality where we're seeing that we're benefiting both from away-from-home and from at-home behaviors, both being strong. And certainly, I think that, that can't sustain at the level that it did in Q1. So we do think that, that's going to moderate a bit. Does that help yes. Thank you. First of all, I'd say, hey, we feel great that we are seeing strength across every piece of our business. In North America, in every component of North America, including US confection and amplify as well as in international. So that's great to see. And certainly, we did have a strong first quarter in international that was significantly ahead of our expectation. I think what was interesting for us was that despite this fact that COVID cases were high in many of those markets, consumer mobility still increased, and that drove demand for our category that was stronger than we anticipated. I think the potential concern and certainly, as you look at the news, you see this everywhere is there certainly are some pretty dire situations, especially in some of the markets that we're in, but certainly, India being one of those, where case counts are rising. There are other markets where the vaccination dissemination is going quite slowly. And as new lockdowns are implemented, we expect that those could hamper mobility and that these trends could moderate. So we know international, things are always volatile, but they certainly are even more volatile during this time. And those markets are not going to have linear behavior. So we expect that we'll see continued volatility. What we're trying to do is to drive what's within our control, and our teams are responding with tremendous agility in adapting the plans based on the stages and the status in each market. So we feel good that all of our key initiatives, whether it's our China transition to the new business model, a restart or upping again our focus in India on our chocolate initiative, all of those things are going well. But there's just a lot outside of our control, and we'll have to see how the year plays out. If things are positive, certainly, there could be upside. And \u2013 however, we also know that there could be downside as well. Good morning. Yes, absolutely. I mean, I think one of the things that we feel good about that COVID just reinforced was the strength of the breadth of our portfolio to be able to participate in different occasions. And so I would start first within core confections and say, we have a \u2013 our business splits a-third, a-third, a-third, instant consumables, which are all about people being out and about on the go; take home, which is all about people being at home and consuming the products there; and then seasons, which is all about celebrations. And so within confection, what we saw was, wow, normally, we might focus a bit more of our efforts on instant consumable. And when COVID hit, we were able to immediately shift media, in store merchandising, et cetera, more to our take-home portfolio. And we also saw that during a time like COVID, consumers were just hungry for connection and so the roles that our brands play during season to create that connectivity and traditions and rituals with something consumers just were so hungry for.

So it's really playing on the pieces of your portfolio at the right piece of time, but having the options and the breadth across the portfolio to be able to meet those needs.

As a reminder this conference is being recorded.  I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin.\nMelissa A. Poole : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's fourth quarter 2022 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our pre-recorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the pre-recorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call.

Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release.  Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck, and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil.  With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody.\nMichele Buck : Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: I guess just one from me. Trying to get a better sense of how you're thinking about elasticity for '23 versus what you saw in '22, which was very little? And what percentage increase in capacity you're expecting for this year? And I guess I asked because, if elasticity were to stay as benign as it has been, and you ramp some capacity, trying to get a sense of whether it could render your flat, just slightly down volume outlook for the year somewhat conservative, or will continued capacity constraints limit the potential for top line upside from here?\nMichele Buck : Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. As we look at price elasticities, we are assuming that they will be closer to last year than they were to historic, but not quite as good as last year. And as we look at our capacity, we will have low single-digit increases in capacity which do give us some ability to flex with demand as we see it. Steven, you can add.\nSteve Voskuil : No, that's fine. \nAndrew Lazar: Excellent. That's it. Thank you so much.\nMichele Buck : Thanks, Andrew. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks, and congrats, everyone, for such a great year. I wanted to know, the guidance for '23 is more aggressive than normal, like you normally start the year rather conservative. But this year, you're guiding above your normal algorithm. And I want to know if could kind of isolate what the key drivers are, and why you've raised it compared to three months ago. Maybe drilling down looks like gross margin is coming in better than you thought, maybe you could explain why.  And then also on market share. Are you expecting market share gains in confectionery in '23? Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil : Sure. Want me to start out. \nMichele Buck : Yeah, go ahead, Steve. \nSteve Voskuil : So just on, the big movers on the top line, obviously price driven, and we have good visibility into that. We saw that effect be part of the driver for the fourth quarter performance, but we see that carrying forward, especially through the first three quarters of next year. And we do have elasticity factors, as Michelle said in the last question. Our planning isn't quite down to the levels of historic elasticity, but something looks more like last year. And if you sort of drop further through the P&L, we do see some benefit from the gross margin side, as we could see more stabilization, the pricing coming down and some cost efficiencies, and a return to more historic levels of productivity.  Now we still have efforts for more productivity. But at least this year, we're starting to see something that we hadn't seen in the last two years. So those are some drivers through the P&L that far. On the market share side, yes, we do expect to have a positive market share next year. I think that's one that we're disappointed about this year and want to see turn the other direction Next Year. \nMichele Buck : Yeah, and some of that market share will be helped by the incremental marketing investment, as we've taken that up, as we have additional capacity online and certainly, the additional capacity as well. As we think about the pacing of the market share, you should think about it relative to the beginning part of the year will be slower, and we won't see those declines, probably till we get into the spring. But once we hit the spring that will really kick into gear. We know that we had some lost opportunity this year around seasons that we weren't able to fulfill totally all of the orders. And then also a little bit of a mix impact from refreshment, being a late rebounder given social behaviors, but we think that'll neutralize going.\nRobert Moskow: Okay, makes sense. Just one follow-up. On the gross margin side, are your cost, like inflation cost coming in better than you thought or is this really just productivity is accelerating more than you thought?\nSteve Voskuil : Yes, probably more on the productivity side. We have pretty good visibility in the cost, with the hedging program and so forth, particularly on commodities, and we're still expecting high-single-digit, year-over-year inflation through commodities, and a lot of the materials items and mid-single digits on things like labor and logistics and other supply chain costs. I don't think those assumptions have changed much from our outlook, but probably a little bit more productivity.\nRobert Moskow: Great. Thank you. \nMichele Buck : Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman : Hi, thanks. You're guiding to a gross margin of around 44.5% next year. I'm just curious for this coming year, what do you see as a, I guess, \u201cnormal level\u201d, if there is such a thing in this kind of environment? And I guess more specifically, if you can grow your gross margin by a healthy amount in an inflationary environment, is there any reason it can't ultimately get back to 45% or above?\nSteve Voskuil : Sure, again, our model is growing gross margin every year. That would be the goal. That's really part of the growth algorithm. And so we've had two years where that's been a challenge. We see that now turning for 2023 and really getting back on the algorithm. And so I would like to say it's price and inflation agnostic in terms of the strategy. How we get there will change based on the external environment. But yes, we do see restoring to gross margins that we had in the past and frankly, continuing to drive that forward.\nKen Goldman : And then, how do we think about the breakdown of sales growth and operating margins by segment in 2023? You gave a little bit there. But are there any unusual items we should be aware of for either of these segments, just as we consider our models, maybe drivers that aren't necessarily apparent at first glance?\nSteve Voskuil : Yeah, the only things that are unusual or different, I kind of go to salty, and we mentioned some of this in the remarks. Salty is going to have a strong top line. We're expecting that. We're also expecting to see gross margin improvement year-over-year. We saw some of that in the fourth quarter, finally seeing pricing catch up in that business a little bit to inflation. But still some room to grow.  But we'll see some reinvestment below that. And so we're going to activate more against the brands next year. We're going to do some capability investments between the lines to really scale up the infrastructure. And part of that infrastructure is the ERP transition that we talked about in the prepared remarks. And so that's probably the one area where I see strong sales growth, some gross margin improvement, less route through to off margin that we might see in a normal year on the back of those capability investments. Other than that, I think the other segments are probably, pretty traditional in terms of the growth characteristics. \nKen Goldman : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. \nBryan Spillane : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. My question is just around the advertising and consumer spend investments. And I guess I had two questions. One, in the prepared remarks, one of the things you talked about investing in is workforce. So I wanted to just understand, is that like more merchandisers and people in the field or something else? And then maybe I'll start with that, then I had one other follow up.\nMichele Buck : Yeah, I mean, as we look at some of the investments that we're making in our employee base, clearly, one of our key strategic goals this year is really to integrate scale our salty business. And so we are adding some increments of talent there to really make sure that we have the right skillsets, and that we have all the employee base and talent needed to do that heavy lifting and the work, some of that also around improving our planning system. Some of the things that whey we buy a smaller company, we need some more sophisticated capabilities.  Then obviously, given a lot of the work across the business on supply chain, where we are continuing to invest to build capacity and resiliency in the network, we have made investments in supply chain talent as well. \nBryan Spillane : Okay, but it's not specifically adding merchandisers or like front -- more people, frontline sales people? \nMichele Buck : Oh, no, no. \nBryan Spillane : Okay. Okay. And then the second, just was related to the kind of the thinking behind the double-digit increase in advertising and consumer spend. Is that partly a -- sort of a function of just inflation has been so persistent. Now obviously, you've got price increases on your own product lines, but consumers are just seeing -- have seen a lot of inflation across a lot of consumables. And is it -- if you're going to have that level of pricing, you really need to advertise in order to sort of make sure consumers stay engaged, because they're going have to start making some choices. Or was there something else that kind of drove the decision or the need to increase advertising at that rate?\nMichele Buck: Yeah, absolutely. So our long-term model, we believe in advertising. We've seen the impact and the returns that we get on advertising in terms of having very strong ROI. So we take a very databased approach to media spending, and we invest where we see that incremental profitable growth. Over time, we do know that that advertising builds consumer connectivity. And we know that, that consumer connectivity is -- what part of what helps us to have the elasticities that we do.  People are connected to our brands. And during the tough times, we know that that connectivity leads to them continuing to buy. So yes, it is important during an inflationary time, and we've done statistics over that, analysis to validate that. And then, as you know, we reduced spend last year really due to capacity constraints. And we did see an impact in demand on several of our brands. And so those are really the priorities where we are reinvesting this year. And we're also investing in some of our whitespace opportunities, like gummies and better for you to strengthen the business, as well as our salty brands, where we're really in a major growth mode, gaining household penetration, gaining market share, and we want to continue that momentum.\nBryan Spillane : Right. Thanks, Michele. \nMichele Buck : Sure. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. \nMichele Buck : Good morning. \nMichael Lavery: I just want to start by following up on the spending. Could you give us a sense -- I recognized last year, you adjusted spending to match your -- better aligned with the capacity limitations. But would this year be restored levels to sort of the optimal targets? Or do you still see that ramping into next year as well? We're just trying to understand a sense of, if you'll be back on your sort of steady run rate or kind of ideal level or if we're not even quite going to be there yet until maybe 2024.\nMichele Buck : Yeah, I mean we are always looking at the returns that we're getting on our spending, and making decisions as we go forward based on that. So we think that we're in a reasonable zip code. I think we've said before that we don't think we have to go back up to the very highest levels that we were at historically. We've done a great job over time, getting a lot of efficiency, getting very tight in our targeting, so that we're getting even greater returns. But I wouldn't also commit that this is the high mark, above which we're not going to move above. We're still probably not quite back to exactly the point we want to be.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, that's really helpful. And just want to unpack a little bit more if we can, a comment you made in the prepared remarks about seasons being a growth driver. You said it's off to a great start. Obviously, last year went really well as well. And so just would love to understand a little bit better how that unfolds and how to be thinking about that.\nMichele Buck : Yeah, we continue to anticipate very strong growth in the seasons. We've continued to see that in the category. Consumers, during the past several years, have even dialed up their interest in season. So it is a strong part of our portfolio. It's a place where we do very well. It's a place where there's a lot of emotional connectivity. There's an anchor event, people want to participate in those anchor events with the brands that they love. And so we think that there's opportunity. We had some missed demand that we weren't able to fully fulfill because of capacity. And we're going to be in a much better position this year to be able to more fully capture that opportunity.  And the first part of the year, as I mentioned earlier, from a share perspective, we won't be as strong as we anticipate that we will be for the seasons towards the back part of the year.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Cody Ross with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nCody Ross : Good morning. Thank you for taking our questions. I just want to go back to the last question on volume and perhaps unpack cadence throughout the year. You have increased capacity for seasons coming on, but you're also lapping the over shipment in the first half this year. Can you just unpack a little bit how you expect volume to progress throughout the year, understanding that you expect for the full year to be flat to slightly down? That's my first question. Thank you. \nMichele Buck : Steve, can you talk that through?\nSteve Voskuil : Yeah, going into the first part of the year, the seasons we've got already identified the volume and shipments there. So as Michele said, we still -- we're dealing with some capacity constraints leading into the seasons in the front part of the year. When you look at the year overall, we're not expecting any big material differences by quarter for volume.\nCody Ross : Okay, that's helpful. And then just one last question on capital allocation here. You're at the low end of your leverage target over the long-term. Are you beginning to look at making additional acquisitions or perhaps return more cash to shareholders in the upcoming years? Thank you.\nMichele Buck : I just say job one right now for us is integrating the amazing acquisitions that we bought SkinnyPop, Pirates and Dot's, and we're investing to leverage their full potential. However, we do always continue to be in the market, looking at assets that can continue to advance our strategies, expand our portfolio appropriately into high growth, consumer demand segments. And we certainly do have a lot of balance sheet flexibility to be able to do the right M&A, if it becomes available. \nSteve Voskuil : That's right. And I would say more broadly, from a capital allocation standpoint, no major changes. We definitely want to be giving back cash and repurchasing shares as part of our strategy. That puts good tension on the internal investments and M&A to make sure we're getting the best return. And so that's an area we'll continue to monitor. We've got a lot of CapEx this year. And so that's one thing that we're taking into consideration as we look at the overall balance of capital allocation.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Growe: Hi, good morning.\nMichele Buck : Good morning.\nChris Growe: Hi. I just had a question. First, if I could a bit of a follow-on to an earlier question, but in particular in the salty snacks division, with the margin being so strong, and in the fourth quarter and reaching over 20%. Was there anything unique to the quarter? And then I certainly heard about investments you want to make both internally and advertising throughout 2023. I guess I just want to understand how you expect the margin to fare throughout the year as margins expand, but just not to the level of which it did here in the fourth quarter.\nSteve Voskuil : Yeah, we're really pleased where the fourth quarter finished. Probably two things drove that. One we did have easier laps in the fourth quarter. And then second, you know, we said earlier, we are seeing pricing, catching up a little bit more to some of the inflation that we saw over the course of the years. We've got a little bit of a benefit of that. As we look to a margin for that business going forward and into next year, we want to again, on the gross margin line, expect to see some continued advancement. We got a lot of plans to still optimize that business. And we've talked before about streamlining the back office, streamlining the supply chain, network, better integrating all of that with our existing Hershey systems, and so forth.  And so in fact, we'll talk more about that when we get to our March Investor Conference, and spend some time on that. But have aspirations to continue to see that profile up over the course of the year. But as Michele said, we are going to reinvest some of that back between the lines to accelerate the top line to invest behind the brands. And then on the capability investments like ERP.  But I'd say the key takeaway is we have still high margin aspirations for that business as we look forward over the next couple of years. \nMichele Buck : And most of those will occur over the longer term. We don't expect significant margin expansion or margin expansion in '23. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, if I could on to understand how inventory will fare for the year. You talked about depleting some inventory late in the years. You've converted -- or moved to the new ERP system. Should inventory grow to the year and then you deplete it? Or does it hold this level? Then it goes just goes lower as you kind of move that inventory out? Have you built it already, I guess is the question, or do you expect to build more?\nSteve Voskuil : Yeah, we haven't built it already. I mean, there will probably be some build, not that material. I mean there's a limit to how much salty inventory we can build. But as we said, when we get to the fourth quarter, we expect a pretty significant depletion. And that's really just to allow the cutover between systems. And so on a net-net basis that will look like a negative for the year for that business. We would expect to see that come back next year, probably with a strong start to the year.\nChris Growe: Okay. Thanks so much for your time. \nSteve Voskuil : Sure. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Nick Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.\nNick Modi: Yeah, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hi, Michele, hi, I was hoping you could just comment on fill rates, kind of where you guys are now versus kind of where you'd like to be. And I know things are below where they have been historically. Just curious, is that just a function of capacity? There's also a labor component to that. And then I had a bigger picture question.\nMichele Buck : Yeah, so I would say our fill rates are much better than where they were. There's been some significant improvement versus last year, as we've been able to invest in capital and get additional capacity on the ground. So and really, there's minimal impact from labor. It was really, largely very much tied to capacity. Now we did step up in labor to enable us to be able to obviously execute against the capacity, and the incremental lines. But we're seeing less network disruption than we've seen in the past, not all the way back to the perfect situation it was before the pandemic, but it certainly improved.\nNick Modi: Right, thanks for that color. And then just the bigger picture question is, look these categories, especially on the chocolate and confectionery side, I think, clearly, we can see a renaissance. And maybe we can attribute some of that to COVID. But I'm just curious like, what does your research, internal research say about what's actually going on with the consumer and these categories? Because I think we can all agree the underlying trend rate has been much better than I think anyone would have expected a couple of years ago.\nMichele Buck : Well, certainly we know that snacking has been on the rise, has continued to be on the rise as a consumer behavior, pre-pandemic, and also post-pandemic. We know that there still is a bit more at home behavior versus folks cutting back on going to restaurants. And certainly that's a benefit across packaged goods snacking. We also know based on our insight that consumers are interested in snacking and particularly in confection and chocolate on two diametrically kind of opposed parts of their emotional state.  One is when they are incredibly happy and it's a treat time, and they want to treat themselves and the other is when there are downtimes, and they want a bright spot. But they do view these categories and especially chocolate as a part of kind of emotional wellness, what it does and how it makes them feel. And then of course I think that the more that we interact with consumers and this really hasn't changed over time, consumers have emotional connectivity to our brands. Our brands are more about the products -- more than just about the products. They are about the moments of connection. Many of them are used in special times. And we get letters all the time with people talking about the special role that some products played in their life.  They remember when they were with a friend, experiencing it or with their kids at a season. And I think that continues to be timeless, and perhaps has even dialed up a bit since the pandemic. \nNick Modi: Great. Thanks for that caller. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJason English : Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for fitting me in. My apologies I didn't get a chance to go through all the prepared remarks. We have a lot going on this morning. Apologies if you have answered the question. I have two quick things. First, the capacity expansion. You give some quantification for the year? What's the cadence? When should we expect to see that capacity coming along?\nMichele Buck : Yeah, it's going to be coming online throughout the year. And again, this sort of fits into a broader discussion we've had on capacity expansion. I think we've talked in the past, if you look at the 2020 to 2024, period, we were looking for a 15% ish increase in capacity across the network. And so what we're going to see in 2023 is going to be a low single digit contribution towards that goal. And I would kind of think about it coming in ratably over the course of the year.\nJason English : Okay, and the elevated CapEx, it sounds like it's a long slog. Should we expect this elevated level to continue into next year, for the year beyond as well?\nMichele Buck : Yeah, not at this level. But I would say at least for the next -- for 2024, we will have some amount of elevated capital. We will still be finishing off the ERP program, and still probably having some tail investments from a capacity standpoint. So those are the two things I would point to and, on the CapEx, as we talked about all the time, the majority of that CapEx is targeted on capacity expansion. If you click into that a large portion is driven by recent fantastic growth we've had there and recent capacity and network capacity has improved significantly. But we still have opportunities, some are recent, some in other brands to unlock more efficiency and capacity. And so that capacity expansion plus the ERP investments that will eventually drop out are the two kind of biggest components of the CapEx right now.\nJason English : Understood. The last question for me. I've always considered your European venture to be a bit opportunistic. It's a small tactical export business. Yet, recently, you've kind of carved it out as a standalone business. Does this signal anything in terms of your strategic intent on expansion in Europe?\nMichele Buck : No, not at all. If that's in reference to any of the talent changes that we made, they were really in the course of just normal development and expansion for people to get new opportunities. Europe continues to be small. We continue to feel that we are making great strides and seeing a lot of growth there. But there is no strategic change in our approach to that market at all. \nJason English : Understood. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. \nPamela Kaufman: Hi, good morning.\nMichele Buck : Good morning. \nPamela Kaufman: Can you talk about your key innovations planned for '23? And how are you thinking about the drivers of top line growth between innovation versus existing brands, where you've been capacity constrained?\nMichele Buck : Sure. So innovation continues to be an important part across our portfolio. And we have several items that are launching this year that we think will generate a lot of consumer excitement and merchandising. And if we look at our core confection business, the highlights there would be Reese's Stuffed with Reese's Puffs. We have a limited edition, which is a Reese's Creamy, and then a Reese's crunchy product. So a line of limited editions that let consumers pick their favorite, which texture they like. And then we have an exciting new kisses flavor that is called Milkilicious [ph], which is a kiss filled with a milk chocolate filling.  On our salty business, we launched as a limited time edition this year, a dot cinnamon sugar flavor. And so folks will see that in the market as it's been very successful. So those are probably the highlights of some of the biggest innovation. We continue with our strategy that we employed several years ago, that's really helped to accelerate our top line growth, which is while innovation is important and we will support innovation across the board, for news and excitement.  We really don't want to stray away from a primary focus on our core. Our core are brands that are sustainable. They have been out there for a long time. Consumers love them. The velocities on them will always be stronger than innovation. So across our entire portfolio, driving our core is job one. And then using new innovation for news and excitement.\nPamela Kaufman: Great, thank you. And just in terms of your organic growth outlook for '23, how are you thinking about the growth between North America confectionery and salty snacks? And maybe if you could just touch on some of the key growth drivers behind the salty snacks business for '23? \nMichele Buck : So I can talk about some of the growth drivers and then let me have Steve talk a little bit about the part of your question. So as we look at salty snacks, we will be, as Steve mentioned investing in marketing, so that we can continue to expand those brands and business and continue our growth in household penetration. So that is clearly an investment that will drive growth. We continue to have some level of distribution upside, especially on Dot's. We saw distribution upside as well as increased item counts in 2022. And we'll see some of that growth continue as we go through '23.  Once we get beyond that, we think will then start to be going more to velocity increases and price pack architecture opportunities. So those are some of the biggest ones. Investments in SkinnyPop, in advertising as well will continue to unlock growth potential. So I think those are some of the biggest growth drivers across the salty business. \nSteve Voskuil : Yeah, just at a very high level, from a projection standpoint, we're expecting high single digits, top line price being the primary driver there. And as we talked about earlier seasons, underneath best seasons, and then media investment behind the brands are going to be big components of that. On the salty side, double digit growth, which is, what we should expect from that business, and more is price there as well, but also volume. And again, as we said, there are two we're investing behind the brand. We have some distribution opportunities, as Michele mentioned.  On the international side, solid mid-single digit performance on the back of distribution, volume, some pricing as well, and some innovation. So at a high level, those are sort of the big targets.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nChristopher Carey : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. \nMichele Buck : Good morning. \nChristopher Carey : Steve, you gave good information on gross margin ranges for the year, a little bit on cadence with the Q1 and the impact of inflation. It's just striking to see high single digit commodities with labor, which is this dynamic of sticky inflation that we're seeing, across the staples landscape. But clearly you have good visibility into that outlook. I guess what I'm wondering is, this is going to be a probably a volatile environment for inflationary drivers, namely commodities over the next year.  And I'm just trying to frame if there is a change in the commodity outlook. Is that something that changes your own outlook? Or are you so locked in on costs at this point, that it's we have good visibility on the year and we're fairly locked in. And that's really more of a consideration, from a year from now, something like that. I have a quick follow-up.\nSteve Voskuil : Sure. On the -- in general, we have pretty good visibility, I would say across cost and commodities. I'd say the hedging program gives us some of that visibility. The caveat is that if you look at the last two years, where we've been bitten, in some cases, those are the things that we don't hedge and have been volatile, things like packaging, and resins and specialty ingredients and so dairy. So those are ones that I think we keep an eye on and movements at some of those, material movements can move the needle on. We saw some of those material movements in the last few years.  I think our expectation is some of that will settle down and with that settling down in our visibility into the rest of the talks. I agree with you it's still potential for volatility, but we feel we've sort of picked the guidance range to try to accommodate most of that volatility.\nChristopher Carey : Okay, that makes sense. One quick follow-up and perhaps something that's even better suited to, the Investor Day coming up. But this sounds confidence on long term margin improvement. And clearly we saw an inflection in the snacks business today with positive commentary on the medium term in that business. So when you think about that long term margin between the confection the sack size do you have any sense of what would be driving that between those segments? Or is it more of a holistic target for the organization over time? Thanks so much.\nSteve Voskuil : Yeah, that is a great one for the investor conference. And -- but I will say, our expectation is we want to see margin improvement across all parts of the business, all segments. And so we've seen a lot of improvement in international in recent years. But we have the same expectation that that's going to continue also. And that we're going to optimize and grow but grow in a sustainably profitable way there.  Salty, probably expectations, given the capital that we've deployed in those acquisitions and the opportunity, we touched on things like private label and the impact that still has on the business as we look to the future. Opportunities to extract more margin out of that business. And in always on the confection side, we want to have a model that drives margin accretion.\nChristopher Carey : Okay, thanks for the answers. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. A question on gross margin in this latest quarter, especially versus the third quarter. The reason I'm asking for color about what might have been your biggest unlocks that fourth quarter is because on a one and multi-year basis, it looks like pricing was rather similar to the third quarter. Yet your margin trend improved. And that fourth quarter was actually higher than it was in the in the fourth quarter of 2019. So any color about unlocks and gross margin would be helpful?\nSteve Voskuil : Yeah, I think the biggest drivers that we touched on, we did have some better productivity dropping through supply chain efficiencies that had ramped up and essentially, Michele said we're not all the way back in terms of that supply chain efficiency. But we'll get to see an uptick in the fourth quarter. And then the -- I'll say the volume growth on the elasticity side, helping dropping some fixed costs absorption through the P&L as well. Those are probably at the point, just a couple of things, those are the ones I point to.\nDavid Palmer: And just a big picture question, one I've been thinking about is in a during this COVID era, clearly, at home snacking did well. You guys have made your own thunder with s'mores and your Seasons. And you've seemed to have a pretty good visibility into what you're doing each year in seasons. And so it looks like you're going to -- you're poised to have a pretty good 2023. But I'm wondering just as you just think about the overall energy for at home snacking as an occasion, do you have a view about whether that can sustain in terms of its growth rate?  I wonder about this not just for Hershey, but for other companies as well. Any comments there would be helpful? Thanks.\nMichele Buck : Sure. So let me start by saying as much as we have benefited on our take home business, with at home snacking, our instant consumable business has also been quite strong. So we've really seen growth across all what we say, all three segments of our business seasons, take home and instant consumable. We don't expect that we're going to lose volume on those segments going forward. So we don't see a reversal in the trend.  But we would say that growth may moderate. We would expect it to moderate a little bit versus where it's been as consumers just shake out into their normal ongoing behavior. \nDavid Palmer: Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Steve Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nSteve Powers : Yes. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to go back to the two topics you talked about already. The A&P investments and the workforce investments just a little bit, drilling down into those. Just any -- on the A&P side any notable phasing of the incremental spending that you're planning and if so just the drivers, of that phasing, if you could. And then on the workforce side, Michele, you walk through a number of priorities, especially on the salty side, and I think there makes sense and they are frankly, intriguing. I guess, question is, where are you with those hires? Is that something that we should anticipate?  You kind of have in the near term pipeline and in the investment show up early in the year and carry forward? Or is it something that builds and is more the spending progressively layers out as the year goes on? Just where you are in in making those hires that you talked about earlier? Thank you.\nMichele Buck : Yeah, so as we looked at the investments in marketing spending, you should think about the confection investments being fairly stable throughout the year. On salty, our investments will be more front loaded during the year because of the -- towards the end of the year is when we're doing the S'more conversion. So we're really going to you know drive the volume harder at the beginning and those investments harder at the beginning of the year.  On SG&A spend, we will see that across the quarters, and especially beginning in Q1. \nSteve Powers : Okay. Okay. Thank you very much. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nMax Gumport : Hey, thanks for the question. Just one for me, and it's on gross margin. So you expect gross margins to be up 40 to 50 basis points year-over-year in 2023, given net price realization and higher levels of productivity, which are expected to offset inflation. But it sounds like 1Q '23 gross margins will be pressured due to lack of a timing benefit related to inventory valuation last year. I'm trying to get a sense if you could close frame the magnitude of that 1Q, '23 impact. Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil : Yeah, so you're exactly right. For quarter one that will be our most pressured gross margin quarter. In fact, I expect we will be still down year-over-year for the first quarter because of those laps. And I don't know if that I'll dimension -- get specific as the guidance for that. But you're exactly right. That'll be our most pressured gross margin quarter.\nMax Gumport : Right, I'll leave it there. Thanks very much. \nSteve Voskuil : Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. First off, Michele, in confection, you're bringing more capacity online, increasing brand spending as well. But how are you thinking about in store activation at this point? I think going back pre-COVID, there was an increased focus in the aisle with the king size and some different shelf sets. Then you move to the checkout lines, and then you would take in some shelf space for magazine [ph] and non-consumable. So as we think about 2023, and I guess even beyond at this point, where the levers you see as most impactful from here? Where do you can you still benefit from activation going forward?\nMichele Buck : So we are always looking to optimize across the entire mix of levers that we have to drive activation. Managing the shelf distribution, shelf space is always a priority. There were some areas as we were lighter on capacity, where we were unable to fill some of those distribution needs. So we see some of that ahead of us as an opportunity as we have improved service. We talked a little bit earlier about the marketing spending where we had pulled back again, because we were lighter on capacity, so reinstating, that.  We know that there's a very strong return on that, reinvesting the front end. Retailers are always looking at how they optimize front end space. And so we partner with them. And we continue to see opportunity there. And as we look at our in store promotional spending, we do believe that getting visibility and display in store is important to our business. That said, our promotional spending is below COVID levels. And we've seen that we've continued to be able to drive the business, where those promotion levels are today.  So that's not a key priority to reinstate back to the past.\nJohn Baumgartner : Okay, thanks for that. And then Steve, on the salty snacks margin. There was a lot of noise this year, you mentioned the catch up on pricing. You had the warehousing in Q4. You had some reduced promo and advertising spending. As we think about the sequential increase in margin from Q3 to Q4, is it possible to bucket those tailwinds across the different elements? Or maybe what do you think the underlying run rate is for segment margin exiting '22? Is mid-teens, high teens, just trying to think about the moving pieces versus the structural improvements there, just far. Thank you. \nSteve Voskuil : Yeah, it's a fair question. There have been a lot of movements across the quarters. I think, think about run rate in the mid teens. That's probably a good baseline to operate from let's say. There will still be movement across the quarters, probably, especially as we look to the back half of this year with that ERP transition that we talked about. As we get further into the year we will give more color to some of that variability. But if you think about mid-teens, that's probably a good starting spot.\nJohn Baumgartner : Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Feeney: Good morning. Thanks very much. So it's been about 15 points or so over the past two years of pricing. And I was wondering if you could characterize -- I know that's data driven. But I wonder if you characterize how much of that was driven by this narrative about rising costs and if costs continue to moderate or even decline, should we expect some -- is the expectation from the retailer that some of that pricing goes away if costs go down, or has this just all been a change in the conversation to let's work together to grow the category? Just curious about how much risk do you have, if cost in fact start to moderate or decline? Thank you. \nSteve Voskuil : Sure. \nMichele Buck : No, we always work together with retailers to try and maximize category growth. That is our fundamental premise, especially being leaders in all of the categories that we are in. If the category is growing, we feel really good that we will benefit from that growth. Historically, there hasn't really been a move in the category to execute price declines or price rollbacks. As prices kind of have gone up, they have tended to stick in the marketplace, as a matter of principle of how that category dynamics have worked.  And what we really try and do is to leverage some of that favorability in price in our holistic model, to reinvest for growth, whether that's reinvesting in capabilities to get smarter about managing the shelf with the retailer, helping them to find new points of interruption, or whether that is incremental consumer investment.\nJonathan Feeney: Makes sense? Thank you. \nSteve Voskuil : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question and answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Poole for any final comments. \nMelissa A. Poole : Thank you so much for joining us this morning. We will be available for any follow-up questions you have. Have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Voskuil",
            "content": "No, that's fine. Sure. Want me to start out. So just on, the big movers on the top line, obviously price driven, and we have good visibility into that. We saw that effect be part of the driver for the fourth quarter performance, but we see that carrying forward, especially through the first three quarters of next year. And we do have elasticity factors, as Michelle said in the last question. Our planning isn't quite down to the levels of historic elasticity, but something looks more like last year. And if you sort of drop further through the P&L, we do see some benefit from the gross margin side, as we could see more stabilization, the pricing coming down and some cost efficiencies, and a return to more historic levels of productivity.  Now we still have efforts for more productivity. But at least this year, we're starting to see something that we hadn't seen in the last two years. So those are some drivers through the P&L that far. On the market share side, yes, we do expect to have a positive market share next year. I think that's one that we're disappointed about this year and want to see turn the other direction Next Year. Yes, probably more on the productivity side. We have pretty good visibility in the cost, with the hedging program and so forth, particularly on commodities, and we're still expecting high-single-digit, year-over-year inflation through commodities, and a lot of the materials items and mid-single digits on things like labor and logistics and other supply chain costs. I don't think those assumptions have changed much from our outlook, but probably a little bit more productivity. Sure, again, our model is growing gross margin every year. That would be the goal. That's really part of the growth algorithm. And so we've had two years where that's been a challenge. We see that now turning for 2023 and really getting back on the algorithm. And so I would like to say it's price and inflation agnostic in terms of the strategy. How we get there will change based on the external environment. But yes, we do see restoring to gross margins that we had in the past and frankly, continuing to drive that forward. Yeah, the only things that are unusual or different, I kind of go to salty, and we mentioned some of this in the remarks. Salty is going to have a strong top line. We're expecting that. We're also expecting to see gross margin improvement year-over-year. We saw some of that in the fourth quarter, finally seeing pricing catch up in that business a little bit to inflation. But still some room to grow.  But we'll see some reinvestment below that. And so we're going to activate more against the brands next year. We're going to do some capability investments between the lines to really scale up the infrastructure. And part of that infrastructure is the ERP transition that we talked about in the prepared remarks. And so that's probably the one area where I see strong sales growth, some gross margin improvement, less route through to off margin that we might see in a normal year on the back of those capability investments. Other than that, I think the other segments are probably, pretty traditional in terms of the growth characteristics. Yeah, going into the first part of the year, the seasons we've got already identified the volume and shipments there. So as Michele said, we still -- we're dealing with some capacity constraints leading into the seasons in the front part of the year. When you look at the year overall, we're not expecting any big material differences by quarter for volume. That's right. And I would say more broadly, from a capital allocation standpoint, no major changes. We definitely want to be giving back cash and repurchasing shares as part of our strategy. That puts good tension on the internal investments and M&A to make sure we're getting the best return. And so that's an area we'll continue to monitor. We've got a lot of CapEx this year. And so that's one thing that we're taking into consideration as we look at the overall balance of capital allocation. Yeah, we're really pleased where the fourth quarter finished. Probably two things drove that. One we did have easier laps in the fourth quarter. And then second, you know, we said earlier, we are seeing pricing, catching up a little bit more to some of the inflation that we saw over the course of the years. We've got a little bit of a benefit of that. As we look to a margin for that business going forward and into next year, we want to again, on the gross margin line, expect to see some continued advancement. We got a lot of plans to still optimize that business. And we've talked before about streamlining the back office, streamlining the supply chain, network, better integrating all of that with our existing Hershey systems, and so forth.  And so in fact, we'll talk more about that when we get to our March Investor Conference, and spend some time on that. But have aspirations to continue to see that profile up over the course of the year. But as Michele said, we are going to reinvest some of that back between the lines to accelerate the top line to invest behind the brands. And then on the capability investments like ERP.  But I'd say the key takeaway is we have still high margin aspirations for that business as we look forward over the next couple of years. Yeah, we haven't built it already. I mean, there will probably be some build, not that material. I mean there's a limit to how much salty inventory we can build. But as we said, when we get to the fourth quarter, we expect a pretty significant depletion. And that's really just to allow the cutover between systems. And so on a net-net basis that will look like a negative for the year for that business. We would expect to see that come back next year, probably with a strong start to the year. Sure. Yeah, just at a very high level, from a projection standpoint, we're expecting high single digits, top line price being the primary driver there. And as we talked about earlier seasons, underneath best seasons, and then media investment behind the brands are going to be big components of that. On the salty side, double digit growth, which is, what we should expect from that business, and more is price there as well, but also volume. And again, as we said, there are two we're investing behind the brand. We have some distribution opportunities, as Michele mentioned.  On the international side, solid mid-single digit performance on the back of distribution, volume, some pricing as well, and some innovation. So at a high level, those are sort of the big targets. Sure. On the -- in general, we have pretty good visibility, I would say across cost and commodities. I'd say the hedging program gives us some of that visibility. The caveat is that if you look at the last two years, where we've been bitten, in some cases, those are the things that we don't hedge and have been volatile, things like packaging, and resins and specialty ingredients and so dairy. So those are ones that I think we keep an eye on and movements at some of those, material movements can move the needle on. We saw some of those material movements in the last few years.  I think our expectation is some of that will settle down and with that settling down in our visibility into the rest of the talks. I agree with you it's still potential for volatility, but we feel we've sort of picked the guidance range to try to accommodate most of that volatility. Yeah, that is a great one for the investor conference. And -- but I will say, our expectation is we want to see margin improvement across all parts of the business, all segments. And so we've seen a lot of improvement in international in recent years. But we have the same expectation that that's going to continue also. And that we're going to optimize and grow but grow in a sustainably profitable way there.  Salty, probably expectations, given the capital that we've deployed in those acquisitions and the opportunity, we touched on things like private label and the impact that still has on the business as we look to the future. Opportunities to extract more margin out of that business. And in always on the confection side, we want to have a model that drives margin accretion. Yeah, I think the biggest drivers that we touched on, we did have some better productivity dropping through supply chain efficiencies that had ramped up and essentially, Michele said we're not all the way back in terms of that supply chain efficiency. But we'll get to see an uptick in the fourth quarter. And then the -- I'll say the volume growth on the elasticity side, helping dropping some fixed costs absorption through the P&L as well. Those are probably at the point, just a couple of things, those are the ones I point to. Yeah, so you're exactly right. For quarter one that will be our most pressured gross margin quarter. In fact, I expect we will be still down year-over-year for the first quarter because of those laps. And I don't know if that I'll dimension -- get specific as the guidance for that. But you're exactly right. That'll be our most pressured gross margin quarter. Thank you. Yeah, it's a fair question. There have been a lot of movements across the quarters. I think, think about run rate in the mid teens. That's probably a good baseline to operate from let's say. There will still be movement across the quarters, probably, especially as we look to the back half of this year with that ERP transition that we talked about. As we get further into the year we will give more color to some of that variability. But if you think about mid-teens, that's probably a good starting spot. Sure. Thank you."

            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Good morning, Andrew. Yeah. Thanks, Andrew. As we look at price elasticities, we are assuming that they will be closer to last year than they were to historic, but not quite as good as last year. And as we look at our capacity, we will have low single-digit increases in capacity which do give us some ability to flex with demand as we see it. Steven, you can add. Thanks, Andrew. Yeah, go ahead, Steve. Yeah, and some of that market share will be helped by the incremental marketing investment, as we've taken that up, as we have additional capacity online and certainly, the additional capacity as well. As we think about the pacing of the market share, you should think about it relative to the beginning part of the year will be slower, and we won't see those declines, probably till we get into the spring. But once we hit the spring that will really kick into gear. We know that we had some lost opportunity this year around seasons that we weren't able to fulfill totally all of the orders. And then also a little bit of a mix impact from refreshment, being a late rebounder given social behaviors, but we think that'll neutralize going. Thanks. Yeah, I mean, as we look at some of the investments that we're making in our employee base, clearly, one of our key strategic goals this year is really to integrate scale our salty business. And so we are adding some increments of talent there to really make sure that we have the right skillsets, and that we have all the employee base and talent needed to do that heavy lifting and the work, some of that also around improving our planning system. Some of the things that whey we buy a smaller company, we need some more sophisticated capabilities.  Then obviously, given a lot of the work across the business on supply chain, where we are continuing to invest to build capacity and resiliency in the network, we have made investments in supply chain talent as well. Oh, no, no. Yeah, absolutely. So our long-term model, we believe in advertising. We've seen the impact and the returns that we get on advertising in terms of having very strong ROI. So we take a very databased approach to media spending, and we invest where we see that incremental profitable growth. Over time, we do know that that advertising builds consumer connectivity. And we know that, that consumer connectivity is -- what part of what helps us to have the elasticities that we do.  People are connected to our brands. And during the tough times, we know that that connectivity leads to them continuing to buy. So yes, it is important during an inflationary time, and we've done statistics over that, analysis to validate that. And then, as you know, we reduced spend last year really due to capacity constraints. And we did see an impact in demand on several of our brands. And so those are really the priorities where we are reinvesting this year. And we're also investing in some of our whitespace opportunities, like gummies and better for you to strengthen the business, as well as our salty brands, where we're really in a major growth mode, gaining household penetration, gaining market share, and we want to continue that momentum. Sure. Good morning. Yeah, I mean we are always looking at the returns that we're getting on our spending, and making decisions as we go forward based on that. So we think that we're in a reasonable zip code. I think we've said before that we don't think we have to go back up to the very highest levels that we were at historically. We've done a great job over time, getting a lot of efficiency, getting very tight in our targeting, so that we're getting even greater returns. But I wouldn't also commit that this is the high mark, above which we're not going to move above. We're still probably not quite back to exactly the point we want to be. Yeah, we continue to anticipate very strong growth in the seasons. We've continued to see that in the category. Consumers, during the past several years, have even dialed up their interest in season. So it is a strong part of our portfolio. It's a place where we do very well. It's a place where there's a lot of emotional connectivity. There's an anchor event, people want to participate in those anchor events with the brands that they love. And so we think that there's opportunity. We had some missed demand that we weren't able to fully fulfill because of capacity. And we're going to be in a much better position this year to be able to more fully capture that opportunity.  And the first part of the year, as I mentioned earlier, from a share perspective, we won't be as strong as we anticipate that we will be for the seasons towards the back part of the year. Steve, can you talk that through? I just say job one right now for us is integrating the amazing acquisitions that we bought SkinnyPop, Pirates and Dot's, and we're investing to leverage their full potential. However, we do always continue to be in the market, looking at assets that can continue to advance our strategies, expand our portfolio appropriately into high growth, consumer demand segments. And we certainly do have a lot of balance sheet flexibility to be able to do the right M&A, if it becomes available. Good morning. And most of those will occur over the longer term. We don't expect significant margin expansion or margin expansion in '23. Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just a quick follow-up, if I could on to understand how inventory will fare for the year. You talked about depleting some inventory late in the years. You've converted -- or moved to the new ERP system. Should inventory grow to the year and then you deplete it? Or does it hold this level? Then it goes just goes lower as you kind of move that inventory out? Have you built it already, I guess is the question, or do you expect to build more? Yeah, so I would say our fill rates are much better than where they were. There's been some significant improvement versus last year, as we've been able to invest in capital and get additional capacity on the ground. So and really, there's minimal impact from labor. It was really, largely very much tied to capacity. Now we did step up in labor to enable us to be able to obviously execute against the capacity, and the incremental lines. But we're seeing less network disruption than we've seen in the past, not all the way back to the perfect situation it was before the pandemic, but it certainly improved. Well, certainly we know that snacking has been on the rise, has continued to be on the rise as a consumer behavior, pre-pandemic, and also post-pandemic. We know that there still is a bit more at home behavior versus folks cutting back on going to restaurants. And certainly that's a benefit across packaged goods snacking. We also know based on our insight that consumers are interested in snacking and particularly in confection and chocolate on two diametrically kind of opposed parts of their emotional state.  One is when they are incredibly happy and it's a treat time, and they want to treat themselves and the other is when there are downtimes, and they want a bright spot. But they do view these categories and especially chocolate as a part of kind of emotional wellness, what it does and how it makes them feel. And then of course I think that the more that we interact with consumers and this really hasn't changed over time, consumers have emotional connectivity to our brands. Our brands are more about the products -- more than just about the products. They are about the moments of connection. Many of them are used in special times. And we get letters all the time with people talking about the special role that some products played in their life.  They remember when they were with a friend, experiencing it or with their kids at a season. And I think that continues to be timeless, and perhaps has even dialed up a bit since the pandemic. Yeah, it's going to be coming online throughout the year. And again, this sort of fits into a broader discussion we've had on capacity expansion. I think we've talked in the past, if you look at the 2020 to 2024, period, we were looking for a 15% ish increase in capacity across the network. And so what we're going to see in 2023 is going to be a low single digit contribution towards that goal. And I would kind of think about it coming in ratably over the course of the year. Yeah, not at this level. But I would say at least for the next -- for 2024, we will have some amount of elevated capital. We will still be finishing off the ERP program, and still probably having some tail investments from a capacity standpoint. So those are the two things I would point to and, on the CapEx, as we talked about all the time, the majority of that CapEx is targeted on capacity expansion. If you click into that a large portion is driven by recent fantastic growth we've had there and recent capacity and network capacity has improved significantly. But we still have opportunities, some are recent, some in other brands to unlock more efficiency and capacity. And so that capacity expansion plus the ERP investments that will eventually drop out are the two kind of biggest components of the CapEx right now. No, not at all. If that's in reference to any of the talent changes that we made, they were really in the course of just normal development and expansion for people to get new opportunities. Europe continues to be small. We continue to feel that we are making great strides and seeing a lot of growth there. But there is no strategic change in our approach to that market at all. Good morning. Sure. So innovation continues to be an important part across our portfolio. And we have several items that are launching this year that we think will generate a lot of consumer excitement and merchandising. And if we look at our core confection business, the highlights there would be Reese's Stuffed with Reese's Puffs. We have a limited edition, which is a Reese's Creamy, and then a Reese's crunchy product. So a line of limited editions that let consumers pick their favorite, which texture they like. And then we have an exciting new kisses flavor that is called Milkilicious [ph], which is a kiss filled with a milk chocolate filling.  On our salty business, we launched as a limited time edition this year, a dot cinnamon sugar flavor. And so folks will see that in the market as it's been very successful. So those are probably the highlights of some of the biggest innovation. We continue with our strategy that we employed several years ago, that's really helped to accelerate our top line growth, which is while innovation is important and we will support innovation across the board, for news and excitement.  We really don't want to stray away from a primary focus on our core. Our core are brands that are sustainable. They have been out there for a long time. Consumers love them. The velocities on them will always be stronger than innovation. So across our entire portfolio, driving our core is job one. And then using new innovation for news and excitement. So I can talk about some of the growth drivers and then let me have Steve talk a little bit about the part of your question. So as we look at salty snacks, we will be, as Steve mentioned investing in marketing, so that we can continue to expand those brands and business and continue our growth in household penetration. So that is clearly an investment that will drive growth. We continue to have some level of distribution upside, especially on Dot's. We saw distribution upside as well as increased item counts in 2022. And we'll see some of that growth continue as we go through '23.  Once we get beyond that, we think will then start to be going more to velocity increases and price pack architecture opportunities. So those are some of the biggest ones. Investments in SkinnyPop, in advertising as well will continue to unlock growth potential. So I think those are some of the biggest growth drivers across the salty business. Good morning. Sure. So let me start by saying as much as we have benefited on our take home business, with at home snacking, our instant consumable business has also been quite strong. So we've really seen growth across all what we say, all three segments of our business seasons, take home and instant consumable. We don't expect that we're going to lose volume on those segments going forward. So we don't see a reversal in the trend.  But we would say that growth may moderate. We would expect it to moderate a little bit versus where it's been as consumers just shake out into their normal ongoing behavior. Yeah, so as we looked at the investments in marketing spending, you should think about the confection investments being fairly stable throughout the year. On salty, our investments will be more front loaded during the year because of the -- towards the end of the year is when we're doing the S'more conversion. So we're really going to you know drive the volume harder at the beginning and those investments harder at the beginning of the year.  On SG&A spend, we will see that across the quarters, and especially beginning in Q1. So we are always looking to optimize across the entire mix of levers that we have to drive activation. Managing the shelf distribution, shelf space is always a priority. There were some areas as we were lighter on capacity, where we were unable to fill some of those distribution needs. So we see some of that ahead of us as an opportunity as we have improved service. We talked a little bit earlier about the marketing spending where we had pulled back again, because we were lighter on capacity, so reinstating, that.  We know that there's a very strong return on that, reinvesting the front end. Retailers are always looking at how they optimize front end space. And so we partner with them. And we continue to see opportunity there. And as we look at our in store promotional spending, we do believe that getting visibility and display in store is important to our business. That said, our promotional spending is below COVID levels. And we've seen that we've continued to be able to drive the business, where those promotion levels are today.  So that's not a key priority to reinstate back to the past. No, we always work together with retailers to try and maximize category growth. That is our fundamental premise, especially being leaders in all of the categories that we are in. If the category is growing, we feel really good that we will benefit from that growth. Historically, there hasn't really been a move in the category to execute price declines or price rollbacks. As prices kind of have gone up, they have tended to stick in the marketplace, as a matter of principle of how that category dynamics have worked.  And what we really try and do is to leverage some of that favorability in price in our holistic model, to reinvest for growth, whether that's reinvesting in capabilities to get smarter about managing the shelf with the retailer, helping them to find new points of interruption, or whether that is incremental consumer investment."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn this call over to your host, Ms. Melissa A. Poole, Vice President, Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin.\nMelissa A. Poole: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for the Hershey Company's third quarter 2022 earnings Q&A Session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our pre-recorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the prerecorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A Session, we will also post the transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q&A Session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning everybody. \nMichele Buck: Good morning, Andrew.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning. Maybe first off you discussed in the prepared marks, say you expect a strong top and bottom line performance in 2023. I guess given where the markets are it seems like items like pension and interest expense will be sort of incremental headwinds obviously for the group as a whole next year. I was wondering if you would be able to help level set us a little bit on sort of where some of these items, at least that you do have visibility to might sit for next year. And I guess if they are material enough to kind of derail the earnings performance in the year.\nMichele Buck: Sure. Andrew, let me start with a little bit of an overview and then I will let Steve dive into a few more of the specifics. So, overall, we believe we can deliver an on algorithm year next year. We believe our sales will be slightly ahead of algorithm. Pricing will be about comparable to 2021. We anticipate that our gross margins will be stable. We will have a step up in investment as we reinvest, reinstate some of the DME spend. Now that we have more capacity available to really be able to be able to take advantage of that and also to invest in capabilities to secure profitable, sustainable future. And we think all of that will net down to strong earnings performance that will likely be at the high end of our algorithm. So that's a little bit of an overview, but Steve, I'll let you kind of go a little bit deeper.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. Just on the discrete items, kind of to answer your question at a summary first, we don't see any derailers in terms of those discrete areas, we will have more pension expense. Our estimate today would probably be $5 million more year-over-year for next year. On the pension side this year we've picked up about $10 million of incremental pension expense. Next year I would, again, markets can change, but today I would probably estimate that is probably twice that number for next year. But neither of those are material enough to shift the needle.\nMichele Buck: Yes. Sorry, just to clarify that first $5 million moves to interest for the year.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, sorry.\nMichele Buck: And then the pension probably about a $20 million.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes.\nAndrew Lazar: That's really helpful.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes.\nAndrew Lazar: Very helpful. And then just lastly, I mean, as you mentioned, you've got incremental pricing on top for 2023. And I appreciate you're planning for greater elasticity than you've seen thus far, which is prudent, but obviously you delivered strong volume this year in the face of high single digit pricing. You've got more capacity coming online. I think ANC is expected to grow faster than sales next year. Dot's entering, I think, the organic calculation to start the year and obviously strong underlying momentum. So I guess at a minimum, shouldn't these help at least mitigate the potential for building elasticities in 2023? I'm just trying to make sure I'm not missing anything else on either side of the ledger. Thanks so much.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, I mean, I think, that's the right way to think about it. As Michele said at the top, I think, we've got a lot of positives in the story for next year as some of the things you mentioned rolled through. And I'm sure we'll have challenges, but we don't see anything yet that is a derailing sort of a factor.\nAndrew Lazar: Thank you very much.\nMichele Buck: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, thanks operator. Good morning everyone. Hey Michele, in the prepared remarks you referenced consumer behavior and maybe seeing some changes in where people shop, I guess, channels and pack types. Could you just elaborate a little bit more on that and maybe how Hershey is adjusting to that?\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. So we are seeing some of those changes in how they are spending. Fortunately, we are seeing them continue to spend, but there is some reprioritization. So specifically value channels and value packs are selling well. We are also seeing some improvements in private label performance and really we're seeing this across the board slightly more noticeable with lower income consumers, but really across all different income levels. Within our categories the trends have really remained very strong as the consumer continues to prioritize snacking and particularly sweet treats. And obviously we have minimal private label presence. So we continue to see that our products remain an affordable treat for families and for consumers. And we know that part of that is they want to reward themselves when times are tough. They also use these products to relieve stress. And we think that those trends will continue. I think on a class to trade basis just to augment relative to the channel piece we have seen particular strength in mass, in club, and in dollar. So certainly in channels that represent strong value.\nBryan Spillane: Okay, thank you.\nMichele Buck: Sure.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is in the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: You've got strong momentum on Reese\u2019s obviously up, I think, it was 16% in the quarter and certainly adding capacity is paying off even Payday which we don't hear too much about typically, is up very strongly behind some new capacity. Can you just maybe give us a little bit more specifics looking ahead in terms of how some of the capacity unfolds? I think you've given maybe like a five-year outlook, but in terms of say next year, would it be \u2013 is it about a fifth comes over the next five years? Do we have to wait longer? Is there a bigger bump near term? Just help us maybe think about some of the pacing because the capacity certainly is working when you can add it.\nMichele Buck: So, we certainly have, I would say, a continuous effort against broadening our capacity, certainly focused only on where we see those really strong returns. Next year, for example, we are planning for five new manufacturing lines to start up throughout the year and that includes three new Reese\u2019s lines. So we do expect a pretty nice increase in capacity. However, some of the investment that we have in 2023 will also be for production that doesn't come online until 2024. So, not all of the incremental spend directly relates to 2023, but we do have continuous capacity coming online into the future years with a big focus on 2023 and 2024. Is that helpful?\nMichael Lavery: That's helpful, yes. It's a little bit more near term skewed it sounds like. And just on Dot's, if I could follow up there, very strong momentum, it looks like it came in about 40% ahead of what we had thought the run rate was when you bought that business. Can you just point to what some of the drivers are and how to think about the sustainability of that kind of momentum?\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. So on Dot's, a big piece of our gains has been continuing to grow distribution. As we purchased the business, there was significant opportunity, particularly on the east coast and with certain customers we were somewhat underdeveloped with Walmart. So Walmart was a big gainer on distribution. Obviously that's a huge customer. At the same time, we're also focused on optimizing the consumer model and all of the spend to maximize impact and starting to drive incremental investment and brand building which is our model across our entire portfolio, which we think will give us further upside beyond the distribution going forward. The other thing I want to just clarify on the capacity piece is while we have significant effort in 2023 and 2024, there will be continued \u2013 if you look across our entire portfolio, continued capacity coming online into the future years beyond that as well. If you look at confections, snacks, et cetera, across the board.\nMichael Lavery: Really helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is in the line of Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed you with your questions.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. Two very different questions. Are there any initial efforts being made to try to consolidate your snack brands together in either route to market or any other operating functions? My understanding is that they get to market in very different ways. And then also for Steve, just wanted to know if you can help us with seasonality in 2023. First half looks like a tough comparison but maybe that's just OpEx [ph].\nMichele Buck: Yes. So relative to our snack brands, to date we have been running those businesses separately as we have had a dedicated focus on continuing to drive ahead the amplified business and also to really integrate the Dot's business as we just took it over in December. Going forward, we are now starting to take a much more holistic look across all of salty with the focus as we go into 2023 on really how we integrate those businesses together across the board to really capture and leverage scale and synergy across everything. Supply chain, marketing, go-to-market, et cetera. So that's really the phase that we are entering now, and I think we believe that's how we will also begin to unlock some of the gross margin expansion that we need to go after on that business. Steve?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, very good. Nothing to add there. On the seasonality, I don't think there is a big story. We've got a big year to laugh, full stop first and second half, and so I don't think \u2013 we're not thinking about a big nuance right now, first half versus second half. I don\u2019t know if that's helpful.\nRobert Moskow: It's simple. Thank you. I'll take it.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nKen Goldman: Hi, just a very quick clarification. First Michele, I think, in response to Andrew's question, if I heard correctly, you said that pricing in 2023 will be similar to 2021. I assume you meant similar to 2022. Unless I heard you wrong.\nMichele Buck: Yes. Sorry about that.\nKen Goldman: That's okay. I've lost time has lost all meeting to me post-COVID.\nSteve Voskuil: I understand. \nKen Goldman: And then really just a quick summary of next year to make sure I heard you correctly there. So you're talking about sales growth being very strong. You don't have an EBIT algorithm, I think. But is it fair to assume, just to summarize that you're expecting very strong sales growth, maybe a little bit higher than EBIT growth, which in turn is a little bit higher than EPS growth, but EPS growth still closer to maybe that 8% organic range with, I guess a small haircut from FX? Am I kind of summarizing that correctly?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, I think you're in the right zip code. Yes.\nKen Goldman: Perfect. That's all I have. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: All right.\nMichele Buck: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please just proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard : Good morning everyone.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard : Can I ask about the high-single digit increase in cost in 2023? I think generally we've been expecting that things might get a little bit easier. Obviously that is easier than what we've seen in 2022, but it's still a pretty big hurdle to get over. Specifically, where are the pain points? What's continuing to go up? How much of it is locked in? Do you have good visibility into that? And is it likely to moderate through the course of the year? So maybe hiring the first half versus the second half. Thank you. And I'll pass it on.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yes, as you said, it's high. It's not as high as this year. And to that extent I like to be in a position when we give more guidance for next year to say we're sort of stabilizing gross margins overall. But nonetheless, still expecting high-single-digit inflation. And where is it coming from? On the commodity side, we still have some commodity pressure in some commodities where we don't have complete hedging coverage, packaging costs, logistics, still seeing inflation in people costs, some energy costs. I would also say technology is probably another one that's starting to be a bigger component. And so across that basket, we're still seeing high-single-digit inflation. I would hope by the time we get to the back half of next year, you're again, starting to see more moderation as we start to lap more of those inflationary costs, but still expecting a pretty significant list next year. Our visibility is pretty good. With our hedging and longer term contracts, I think, we do have pretty good perspective on that number today.\nAlexia Howard : Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nPamela Kaufman: Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nMelissa A. Poole: Good morning.\nPamela Kaufman: Can you discuss the shipment timing dynamics that impacted Q3 results? You pointed to earlier seasonal shipments and inventory replenishment benefiting top line in the quarter. So where are retailer inventory levels now and are there any additional timing shifts that we should be aware of over the coming quarters? And then just on the Q4 implied guidance, which points to deceleration to low-single digit growth, is that largely reflection of the inventory dynamics or are there other factors contributing to the outlook?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. On the inventory timing for Q3 the two big factors that we talked about were one, some inventory build as we mentioned, we didn't expect as much inventory build as we saw in Q3. Again, what we did see wasn't as big as we saw earlier in the year but it was a factor of bottom point. And then we also saw some seasonal pull forward, and this continues a little bit of a trend of retailers pulling seasons in earlier and earlier and saw \u2013 we saw about a two-point benefit in the third quarter from that. As we look to the fourth quarter we also expect we'll see some seasonal pull forward with Valentine's and Easter, so that will have some impact potentially on Q4. But the \u2013 probably the biggest factor in the Q4 guided really just the assumptions around elasticity and again, being a little bit prudent as we think about what's happening with the consumer and not being quite as aggressive as maybe more recent elasticity we've seen.\nPamela Kaufman: Great. And can you comment on current promotional levels? You indicated that they're back to more normalized levels. Can you address what types of promotions you're implementing and how you're balancing higher promotions with the capacity constraints? And then do you expect promotions to continue to step up next year?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So our promotions are pretty much in line with historical. When we do promotion in this category, it's always our first objective to get display because these can drive \u2013 this category can drive a lot of impulse. So a focus on feature and display, display where possible and as usual we always put a big focus on our core brands. So we may use news to create some excitement on a display, but we know that our core brands are the strongest mover and that's really where the bulk of the focus will be. So it's a bit where we are on promotion. If we think about next year we think we'll be at about the same level as we've been. There might be some shifts across the quarters, but pretty much in line.\nPamela Kaufman: Great, thanks. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Nick Modi with RBC. Please proceed with your questions.\nNick Modi: Yes. Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nMichele Buck: Hi, Nick.\nNick Modi: Hi, Michele. So I was just wondering in terms of growth drivers, we've been getting a lot of good feedback on the pantry pack especially on the online channel, so I was just hoping you could talk a little bit about that and what your insights are saying, and maybe how \u2013 where you can take that strategy going forward? And then the second thing would be just on alternate channels. I mean obviously FDM has been a very strong area for Hershey, but there seems to be a lot of pockets of opportunity and in other channels not measured. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on that strategy as you move forward?\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. So as we approach innovation we've really evolved our strategy over time to continue to provide product news, but also really to look at packaging as a big unlock because packaging enables us to provide consumers with our core brands, which they love but in a different packaging format that tends to open up a new occasion and that can be very powerful and very sustainable and that's really what the pantry pack did. As consumers are spending more time at home it's almost the ability to have their own single-serve dispenser in their pantry or in their refrigerator if they so desire. So we're really pleased with how it's doing to date. We still have some distribution upside opportunity to further capture but it's done what we were hoping to and we'll continue to focus on packaging for new occasions. Relative to non measured and alternate channels, yes, this has always been a focus for us. I would say its capacity got tight, we pulled back a little bit, de-prioritized a little bit during COVID but we are really leaning back in now and the team is aggressively focused on really trying to get our products everywhere that they possibly can.\nNick Modi: Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJason English: Hey folks, good morning. Thanks for slotting me in.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nJason English: A couple of questions. And so first in prepare remarks; I think you noted that you're expecting growth trends on everyday products to moderate. Can you elaborate on what you're seeing and also comment on how this influences your view of I guess how much more capacity you have to push price on every day and whether or not you should be looking to layer on a bit more promotion to counter whatever trend you're seeing?\nMichele Buck: So we've been pretty happy with the strong trends that we have seen on retail takeaway. And certainly throughout the year we've been trying to balance the seasonal sell through with everyday business and really look at the two somewhat holistically. I think we've been held back a little bit as you mentioned through capacity. We're excited that next year we open up a bit more capacity, which then allows us to reinstate some of the spending that we had pulled back on, which we think will also provide some momentum for us going forward.\nJason English: Okay. Switching gears; M&A, your track record of late has been pretty successful. Your balance sheet certainly suggests you have capacity for more. Do you have organizational bandwidth to do more anytime soon or is all eyes of detention focused on integrating dots and also it sounds like not just integrating dots, but addressing the whole structure of salty snacks as you look to combine those businesses and leverage those synergies you discussed?\nMichele Buck: I mean, certainly I would say job one for us is the integration and continued growth and acceleration of the entire salty portfolio. So we do really have scale there now and a lot of opportunity ahead of us. Great top line momentum and then opportunity to leverage that scale to improve the margin structure; so that's clearly job one. That said we are always looking and evaluating the marketplace and given the health of our balance sheet, we certainly would consider something that made sense for us that we believe we could execute well.\nJason English: Understood.\nMichele Buck: Yes.\nJason English: Understood. Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nChris Growe: Hi, good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nChris Growe: Hi. I just wanted to ask a little more of a near-term question around the fourth quarter. You had \u2013 it sounds like you have some further pull forward of next year's season or 2023 seasons? And then I also think you have an easy shipping comparison with the previous year we had less shipping days in the fourth quarter of 2021. I just wanted to get a sense what that means for a volume in the fourth quarter with little extra seasons and then a little extra benefit from the shipping day factor?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. On the season side, it's not a net benefit because we've pulled some of the Q4 into Q3 season, so we got a little bit of a deficit that will be potentially partly made up by pull forward at 2023 seasons, that's probably the biggest piece; in terms of calendar-days it really not a big factor for shipping days.\nChris Growe: You had two less shipping days on the fourth quarter of 2021. Does that not compare beneficially to this year no?\nSteve Voskuil: Not.\nMichele Buck: I think the calendar only shift by maybe one-day this year, so it shouldn't have a material impact.\nChris Growe: Okay. Got it. And I did \u2013 a quick question around the gross margin as I look at the gross margin decline year-over-year and look at the margins by division, I'm just curious is there more of a gross margin kind of lag or shortfall basically a pricing versus cost inflation shortfall in salty snacks versus confectionary. I'm just trying to get a sense of the pricing coming through in confectionary, should that benefit the margin and would that therefore benefit the overall gross margin more so? Or is it salty snacks that needs more pricing here to offset the inflation?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. So there's a lot in there. I think obviously pricing on confectionary is great in the plan. We'll see \u2013 we'll see the full effect of that in the fourth quarter and it'll be a big factor in the 2023 outlook. On salty we have taken price, it probably hasn't come to the market quite as fast and as Michelle said, as we look at strengthening that business and the gross margins and at the same time continuing the rapid growth on the top line pricing is a lever like it is for all our businesses that we'll continue to look at. And what I'm pleased with is we look at the progression of the salty margins even this year. We started out the first quarter order of magnitude, I think 1,200 basis points down year-over-year, that's improved sequentially and we'd expect that to approve again in the fourth quarter. So as we get to the \u2013 as we get to next year continuing to drive margin improvement in that business through all levers available is going to be a high priority.\nChris Growe: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Cody Ross with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nCody Ross: Good morning. Thank you for taking our questions. Based on the prepared remarks, it sounds like your underlying volume excluding the seasonal shipments and retailer inventory replenishment was down. Is that correct? And how did that compare to your expectations?\nSteve Voskuil: Q3 is roughly flat overall and I would say it was in line with expectations. Like I said, we probably put a little more inventory than we expected, but where we landed on base volume was more or less in line with what we expected.\nCody Ross: Thank you for that. And then I think you mentioned your chocolate market share was up versus pre pandemic. Can I assume that's dollar share? Can you just comment on how that compares from a volume share perspective? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yes. That was dollar share and it is similar from a volume share perspective.\nCody Ross: Okay, great. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Feeney: Good morning. Thank you. Michele, you mentioned in your prepared remarks about a lot of food industry leaders have mentioned while reporting pretty good numbers in the past couple of weeks. A sense of, I think it was concern about or concern about the stress that inflation was bringing to consumers. And I think that's certainly true and it's certainly an impact on retailers, but if I just dived into the data you have like where are you seeing that, if anywhere? Is trade down behavior happening? And how, if you think about I don't know prior periods where there's nothing quite like this period, but say consumer distress accompanied by rising inflation. I think we had something like that dynamic in 2010. How did consumers behave and as you look forward how is this go around with the consumer reacting to a tougher environment driven by crowding out factor some other costs; how does this compare?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So we remain very focused on the consumer and certainly we are aware of the pressures that are on them. What I would say is overall it has not impacted our total performance and overall product performance to a large degree. Yes, there are some shifts in terms of seeing more consumers buying value packs, purchasing in value channels, and then certainly in other categories where private label has really dialed up. But I would say overall we need to continue to be always focused on the consumer and when they could hit a breaking point, but to date as we look at our elasticity we really aren't seeing signs of that impacting our business. That said, we're going to be very focused on it going forward because we don't want to \u2013 we don't want to miss a trend. I would say historically our category has tended to fare pretty well during these times because it is an affordable indulgence when consumers can't afford a lot of other things.\nJonathan Feeney: Very clear. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that capacity was added for Reese's and Gummies in 3Q. How much of a capacity increase was that? And were you in any way constrained on these platforms before this or is this just simply anticipatory of ongoing growth?\nMichele Buck: Yes. We're not going to get into a lot of the specifics around specific brand capacity just for overall competitive reasons. But yes, we were constrained on both and this capacity did allow us to unlock whether it was broader distribution, reinstating of promotions, upping our marketing spend selectively et cetera.\nDavid Palmer: Yes. Understood on that. I wanted to ask on convenience channels and single-serve packaging, I've heard certain retail measures of food service like convenience store, food service have gotten stronger lately. I wonder where is your volume in convenience and single-serve packaging? If you look at checkout counters too; how does that compare versus pre-COVID? Are you all the way back is \u2013 is that ramping more quickly than some of your other packaging?\nMichele Buck: I would say that overall for convenience stores in total not specific to our business, some of the trends have moderated particularly with regard to unit purchase, though I'd say snacking and confection products continued outpace the overall store and they are growing double digits. So certainly we had seen a pretty significant decline when consumers were not mobile and now that consumers are much more mobile than they were previously, we've seen that business really come back.\nDavid Palmer: Is that going to be a meaningful help to profitability mix or is it not a big deal?\nMichele Buck: No, not really. I mean, overall we sell single-serve in other units or in other channels as well. So no.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time I'll turn the call back to Melissa Poole for closing remarks.\nMelissa A. Poole: Thank you for joining us this morning. We look forward to catching up with you throughout that day to answer any other questions you may have. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Good morning. Yes. Just on the discrete items, kind of to answer your question at a summary first, we don't see any derailers in terms of those discrete areas, we will have more pension expense. Our estimate today would probably be $5 million more year-over-year for next year. On the pension side this year we've picked up about $10 million of incremental pension expense. Next year I would, again, markets can change, but today I would probably estimate that is probably twice that number for next year. But neither of those are material enough to shift the needle. Yes, sorry. Yes. Yes. Yes, I mean, I think, that's the right way to think about it. As Michele said at the top, I think, we've got a lot of positives in the story for next year as some of the things you mentioned rolled through. And I'm sure we'll have challenges, but we don't see anything yet that is a derailing sort of a factor. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, very good. Nothing to add there. On the seasonality, I don't think there is a big story. We've got a big year to laugh, full stop first and second half, and so I don't think \u2013 we're not thinking about a big nuance right now, first half versus second half. I don't know if that's helpful. Thank you. I understand. Yes, I think you're in the right zip code. Yes. All right. Good morning. Sure. Yes, as you said, it's high. It's not as high as this year. And to that extent I like to be in a position when we give more guidance for next year to say we're sort of stabilizing gross margins overall.

            "content": "Good morning, Andrew. Sure. Andrew, let me start with a little bit of an overview and then I will let Steve dive into a few more of the specifics. So, overall, we believe we can deliver an on algorithm year next year. We believe our sales will be slightly ahead of algorithm. Pricing will be about comparable to 2021. We anticipate that our gross margins will be stable. We will have a step up in investment as we reinvest, reinstate some of the DME spend. Now that we have more capacity available to really be able to be able to take advantage of that and also to invest in capabilities to secure profitable, sustainable future. And we think all of that will net down to strong earnings performance that will likely be at the high end of our algorithm. So that's a little bit of an overview, but Steve, I'll let you kind of go a little bit deeper. Yes. Sorry, just to clarify that first $5 million moves to interest for the year. And then the pension probably about a $20 million. Thanks. Yes, absolutely. So we are seeing some of those changes in how they are spending. Fortunately, we are seeing them continue to spend, but there is some reprioritization. So specifically value channels and value packs are selling well. We are also seeing some improvements in private label performance and really we're seeing this across the board slightly more noticeable with lower income consumers, but really across all different income levels. Within our categories the trends have really remained very strong as the consumer continues to prioritize snacking and particularly sweet treats. And obviously we have minimal private label presence. So we continue to see that our products remain an affordable treat for families and for consumers. And we know that part of that is they want to reward themselves when times are tough. They also use these products to relieve stress. And we think that those trends will continue. I think on a class to trade basis just to augment relative to the channel piece we have seen particular strength in mass, in club, and in dollar. So certainly in channels that represent strong value. Sure. Good morning. So, we certainly have, I would say, a continuous effort against broadening our capacity, certainly focused only on where we see those really strong returns. Next year, for example, we are planning for five new manufacturing lines to start up throughout the year and that includes three new Reese's lines. So we do expect a pretty nice increase in capacity. However, some of the investment that we have in 2023 will also be for production that doesn't come online until 2024. So, not all of the incremental spend directly relates to 2023, but we do have continuous capacity coming online into the future years with a big focus on 2023 and 2024. Is that helpful? Yes, absolutely. So on Dot's, a big piece of our gains has been continuing to grow distribution. As we purchased the business, there was significant opportunity, particularly on the east coast and with certain customers we were somewhat underdeveloped with Walmart. So Walmart was a big gainer on distribution. Obviously that's a huge customer. At the same time, we're also focused on optimizing the consumer model and all of the spend to maximize impact and starting to drive incremental investment and brand building which is our model across our entire portfolio, which we think will give us further upside beyond the distribution going forward. The other thing I want to just clarify on the capacity piece is while we have significant effort in 2023 and 2024, there will be continued \u2013 if you look across our entire portfolio, continued capacity coming online into the future years beyond that as well. If you look at confections, snacks, et cetera, across the board. Yes. So relative to our snack brands, to date we have been running those businesses separately as we have had a dedicated focus on continuing to drive ahead the amplified business and also to really integrate the Dot's business as we just took it over in December. Going forward, we are now starting to take a much more holistic look across all of salty with the focus as we go into 2023 on really how we integrate those businesses together across the board to really capture and leverage scale and synergy across everything. Supply chain, marketing, go-to-market, et cetera. So that's really the phase that we are entering now, and I think we believe that's how we will also begin to unlock some of the gross margin expansion that we need to go after on that business. Steve? Yes. Sorry about that. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning. Yes. So our promotions are pretty much in line with historical. When we do promotion in this category, it's always our first objective to get display because these can drive \u2013 this category can drive a lot of impulse. So a focus on feature and display, display where possible and as usual we always put a big focus on our core brands.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin.\nMelissa Poole: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's second quarter 2022 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the pre-reported remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session, we will also locate transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning everybody.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: As you discussed in the prepared remarks, inventory refill has certainly been nicely additive to volume growth through the first half of the year. Where do you think retailers are at this stage? And how much more of a benefit, I guess, can this be in the second half from the prepared remarks, if I'm reading it right, it seems to suggest maybe the bulk of that inventory refill is behind you at this point and maybe no longer enough to necessarily offset what volume elasticity you are seeing? So just some clarity there would be helpful.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah, that's exactly right, Andrew. We saw a pretty strong inventory replenishment in the second quarter as we commented. A portion of that was a pull-forward from the second half, so really a timing move. So as we look at the back half, we're really not seeing any additional meaningful inventory replenishment in the second half guidance.\nAndrew Lazar: Right. And then sort of following on that, I guess, as you and others slowly start to get back to a better inventory position and some of the supply constraints slowly ease. I guess, not surprisingly, we're starting to hear from, I think from Hershey and others that they'll be in a better position, maybe for the first time in a while, right, to begin to kind of ramp back up merchandising activity to drive volume and traffic. And I can understand why in this environment, some might simply see that as retailer concessions, given all the pricing that's come through in the industry and with commodities starting to roll over. I assume you see this as more getting back to maybe a more normal cadence of spending and really looking just to drive volumes and traffic and protect elasticity\u2019s that I still think can be, in many cases, incremental to the business, but I was hoping, Michelle, you could kind of comment a little bit on that, if you could. Thank you so much.\nMichele Buck: Yeah, absolutely. As we have always talked about our investment model or our model and running the businesses, we strongly believe in investing to drive the top line and with our strong margins that enables us on the bottom line. So we always want to be spending to the consumer advertising our brands, having the right levels of promotion, the right levels of innovation. And as we mentioned earlier, given some of those supply constraints, we did have to pull off on that a bit just because it didn't make sense to make those investments given some of those constraints. But we very much look forward to re-upping the investments as we look at the second half. We have always planned an increase both in DMEs as well as incremental merchandising coming back online.\nAndrew Lazar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Hi, Alexia.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Hi there. So can I ask about the -- you talked about the general supply chain disruption that you're still experiencing. Can you talk about exactly where the pain points are? And I'm thinking across raw materials, packaging, labor, where are the things that you're really wrestling with at the moment? And are you seeing light at the end of the tunnel at this point? It sounds as though things are getting a little easier. And then I have a follow-up.\nMichele Buck: I mean I'd say, generally, we continue to see struggles across the supply chain. How I'd characterize it is what those are have evolved. So where we are now, I would say, early on, it was some of the basic logistics issues largely driven by labor. And as we've evolved, I'd say, we're now starting to see bigger concerns relative to scarcity of ingredients, needing to leverage different suppliers at higher costs and price points in order to secure production and then also the geopolitical environment has put certain strains on the business. Certainly, the Ukraine-Russia issue created some scarcity and issue with ingredients. And more recently, there have been additional restrictions from Russia on the EU relative to natural gas. Germany will be impacted. That's an area where we source a lot of equipment, supplies, as do many of our suppliers. So I would say that that's kind of evolved. Steve, would you add anything to that?\nSteve Voskuil: The only thing I would add is that we're also starting to see more cost flow through from third parties, so co-packers, co-manufacturers, and those -- a lot of those are under contract, and so it happens as those contracts renew but they're facing the same cost pressures and disruptions that we're facing. And so we're starting to see more of that impact the P&L as well.\nMichele Buck: I guess I'd also just add, we have made significant progress in investments in capacity, significant investments. And so part of our short-term pain was once you make those investments, it takes some time to get them up and running to get to the lines actually in place. And so part of some of the relief we're seeing is the gradual coming online of those capabilities as well, which is helpful.\nAlexia Howard: That's super helpful. Thank you so much for all the color there. And just as a follow-up, how big is India these days. You called it out in the prepared remarks, I haven't seen much news on India for a while. And I'm just wondering, how do you avoid the same problems coming up that you had in China several years ago? I know you've moved -- backed off from China and doing it more arms length these days, why is India a different market? Why can that work over the longer term? Thank you and I\u2019ll pass it on.\nMichele Buck: India is still relatively very small for us, growing high double digits. But back when we really made our decisions on China and India, for me, the key difference in India is the cost of doing business in that market is very different. So media costs, labor costs. And so in both markets, we thought we had the potential to drive top line. But as we really did assessment and looked at the NPV of our investment, India is a market that we feel good about our prospects of getting to profitable growth. Frankly, we're already in a place that we like relative to where gross margins are on that business, very different than where we ever were in China.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Robert Moskow with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, Michele. Hi, Steve.\nMichele Buck: Hi.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nRobert Moskow: Good morning. I thought the comments about 2023 were pretty encouraging, albeit at a pretty early stage. You said that you expect your pricing actions to be partially offset by high single-digit inflation and then you also have productivity. So is that -- do you expect the pricing lap to offset inflation, cost inflation in 2023 because you've had lags in 2022. So I guess that's a positive. And then maybe you could talk about the advertising increase that you're thinking you need to do. How much of that is just restoring what's lagged so far? And how do you think about how much investment is needed?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yeah. I mean, for 2023, we're still talking at a pretty high level. We'll get a lot more fine-tuned as we get through the third quarter and get more picture for next year. But we are seeing high single-digit price is the expectation to come through. Volume wise, we'll watch and see how consumers be able to know more about elasticity\u2019s as we come out of this year. And as you said, overall inflation, we're still seeing high single digits. When you peel into that, we'll have some -- I expect some commodity impact still as we'll be rolling off to more favorable hedges into hedges that were struck at prices that look more like recent times. We still see logistics and third-party cost impacts in there. And I think it's too soon yet to say whether the price is going to fully offset all of those inflationary impacts, we'll know more again as we get through the third quarter towards the end of the year. But we do want to increase advertising and we called that out in the remarks. We see that growing faster than the rate of sales. And as you said, it's really, as Michele said minutes ago, making sure that we continue to reinvest in brands, reinvest in consumers and have a healthy level of investment once we have supportability.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Did you say that, Steve, that you expect your pricing to be up high single digit next year because of the flow-through?\nSteve Voskuil: That's correct.\nRobert Moskow: Okay, all right. Thank you.\nMichele Buck: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thank you. One quick one and then a longer one on Halloween. I just wanted to get a sense, if possible, for the North America salty snacks business, the margin going forward. We've seen some volatility there. Just wanted to kind of get a sense for how to model that in the next couple of quarters, given some of the cloudiness we have in our model or at least our model on that one?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. I'd be happy to take that one. So as you saw in Q2 looks a lot like Q1. We continue to see higher raw material costs and logistics costs that for these two quarters are more than offsetting the price that we've taken so far. That said, we've announced more price increase in the second quarter. So as we roll forward through the next two quarters, we do expect to see some stability and relief there. We're also going to begin to lap in the back half some of the higher logistics costs that we've been talking about. And so that will provide a little bit of relief there as well. And then longer term, as we talked about on last quarter's call, we continue to advance the structural changes that we need to do for that division. So things like setting up or formalizing the supply chain, some of the back-office efficiencies that we need to put in place. And longer term, that will drive more structural improvement. But right now, it's kind of fighting the balance between pricing and inflation and commodities costs.\nKen Goldman: Thank you for that. And then I wanted to ask about Halloween. It's early to be precise, but you guided to high single-digit sales growth. And you said that part of the reason is you're still capacity constrained, I was a little curious why the guidance wasn't higher. Maybe it's just -- there was a very difficult comp or you're facing a difficult comp from last year. Maybe it's just a little bit of conservatism because it's still early. But I would have expected maybe capacity to be less of an issue just given how important the holiday is. And maybe you could be rather in an all hands-on deck mode right and producing as much seasonal candy as possible. But maybe that's just an overly simplistic view of your supply chain. But I was just curious why that guidance wasn't a little bit higher?\nMichele Buck: So Ken, as we look at the business, we had a strategy of prioritizing every day on-shelf availability. It was a tough decision to balance that with the seasons, but we thought that was really important. And so that was a choice that we needed to make. We had opportunity to deliver more Halloween, but we weren't able to supply that. And we were really producing. We began producing Halloween back in the spring. And that's really when we needed to make these key decisions on what we were going to produce, so tough trade out to make. We feel really good about having high single-digit growth, but we also feel good about as we get into the future being able to have more capacity to really fulfill more of the demand that we see during the season.\nSteve Voskuil: It's definitely all hands on deck. You make mistake.\nKen Goldman: Understood. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nJason English: Hi, good morning folks. Thanks for letting me in.\nMichele Buck: Hi, Jason.\nJason English: I guess I want to start on capacity because there's a little bit of conflicting messages here. I think on one side, you've got enough capacity to be refilling retailer inventory levels. But on the other side, you don't have enough capacity to meet demand for some products. Can you help me put those two conflicting things and also give me a little bit better understanding of where the bottlenecks are, and what the pathway and time line is to relieve those bottlenecks?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. So capacity is constrained, but obviously in certain parts of the portfolio, more than others. So there are certain places we have no constraints and there are other places that we are more constrained. We've shared previously that Reese's is one of the areas where we have seen high double-digit growth for extended periods of time. It's our very largest brand. So that's certainly been a pressure point. And then there are a few other places that have been pressure points and where we've needed to make trade-offs in order to prioritize some parts of the portfolio. So we continue to work through a capacity investment plan to address where the soft areas are and bring capacity online. So that might be part of the mixed messaging is there are certain places we're not constrained others that we are. Refreshment specifically Icebreakers Mint is one area where we had some production difficulties as we ramped production back up after the COVID softness. And so that's one place as well that we're continuing to work to get more supply available. Does that help?\nJason English: It does. It doesn't shed a lot of light on when you think the issues will be behind you, but it certainly helps in understanding where the issues are.\nMichele Buck: So as we get through the issues, I would say we're making -- I would characterize it as gradual improvement. Certainly, we are, I would say, quite constrained this year. We see that gradually improving as we get through 2023. And as we get to 2024, we feel much better about our ability to be able to fully meet demand. So that's how I would characterize it. Steve, anything\u2026\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah, just the color around in the last three years, we've invested on the order of $800 million on capacity mostly in the core. And so we've got 13 new lines in place coming online. We've refurbished 11 and so as Michele said, over the next year or two, we're going to start to see more significant capacity available.\nMichele Buck: If it helps. The investments that we made will result in about a 15% increase in our internal volume production capability. That should allow us to catch up but also to deliver some of that future growth.\nJason English: For sure. That's helpful. And I want to come back to Rob Moskow's question real quick. It was -- I was surprised that you were offering color on 2023 this early? It's uncharacteristic of you. And it begs the question of why? I guess Rob showed one interpretation of, hey, like you have inflation, but your price above it. Don't worry gross margins are weak now, but they'll come back to growth next year. I guess, it's one way to interpret it. The other is your emphasis on we're going to lean into spending next year, so don't get out over your tips in terms of how much margin flow through is going to drop to the bottom line. Which were those two interpretations do you think we should be leaning towards?\nSteve Voskuil: I would just say it's still pretty early. We're trying to just give some broad movements on the top line and inflation. That's really the part that we could share. I say we're learning more every month and quarter that goes by, we'll have a lot more to share as we get to the end of the year. So really not trying to get ahead of our skis just extending some of the color we see right now.\nMichele Buck: And Jason, if I would just add a little bit was just related to some of the pricing that's in the marketplace and expecting to come, trying to put that in perspective around how much 2023 factored into that choice and just trying to make sure that everybody was understanding some of the inflation that we see coming in 2023 to help put some of that pricing in perspective as well.\nJason English: For sure, for sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Hi, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: Just wanted to follow-up on, I guess, the -- just the commentary around inflation. And I guess two things, Steve. One, you mentioned -- it's been mentioned in the call that there's some of the pressure is like scarcity of ingredients, and it's more than just like market-based type things, right? So I guess what I was trying to understand is just how much of the increase in COGS that you're experiencing now as maybe a more permanent shift? And how much of it is still a function of just the current environment, and maybe there will be some relief like disinflation at some point in time? So just trying to understand how much do you think is really just, hey, look, this is now our kind of permanently rebased higher costs, or is there -- or do you think some of this could be more variable and you get some disinflation in the future?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. So it's a really good question, and it's hard to answer that one with precision as you look at all the moving pieces there are clearly some that we would see as temporary. The scarcity issues, hopefully, some of the commodities pressures that are being influenced by the events in Eastern Europe, things like that. On the other side, we've seen more labor inflation and other things that could prove to be more structural. And so again, as we get to the end of the year, and we get some guidance for next year, I'll probably give some more color on that. But it is a mix. Some are temporary and some at least have the potential to be longer lasting. That said, we also focus on productivity and continuous improvement every year and extend the goal of that program is to be able to more than offset over time some of those structural costs. And so that also has to continue to advance.\nBryan Spillane: Right, right, right. Okay. All right. That's all I had. Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Morning.\nMichael Lavery: I just wanted to come back to Dot's, which obviously is up very strongly. I would love to understand a little bit more some of the dynamics there. How much is distribution driven? And maybe more importantly, how much distribution upside runway do you still have left?\nMichele Buck: Sure. So we are absolutely very pleased with Dot's performance in the marketplace and the momentum that we see. I think what we're really happy about is we continue to gain distribution, but we are maintaining our velocities as we continue to broaden reach. And that can be a challenge to do as you continue to broaden reach into sometimes some of the smaller accounts. So all the trends are in line with our expectations. Retail sales growing about 50% over the past 12 weeks, share up about 370 basis points. We are right now lapping some large distribution increases from prior year. So we do expect to see a little bit of softening in trend as we overlap that, but we do have continued distribution upside as we took over the business, the distribution was really concentrated primarily in the center of the country and the West. And we're really still filling out the East and importantly, just making sure that we have the right placement in stores and then, of course, beginning to actually market and drive consumer messaging to the brand, which we help think will further drive upside in velocities.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up on the pricing, I know you've said you've got at least most if maybe not all of it that's announced. Is there any of that's sort of TBD or to be negotiated, or is it all locked and loaded and just a question of on the cloud ready to go out the door?\nMichele Buck: Our recent announced pricing action is being executed. It is going as planned, and we're starting to see some of the new retails in the market already. We feel good that we really took a consumer focused approach for the right retail price points, and we're also beginning to reset some of the promotional points. So overall, the prices are moving in line with our recommendations and our expected ranges. And we are pleased about that as we want to really move ahead with further investments in the business and capacity and consumer spending, new capabilities and the right programming and all of this will allow us to do that to drive profitable category growth.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Growe with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Growe: Thank you. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nChris Growe: Good morning. I just had a question first on your -- the recent price increases you put into place in particular, across confectionery. I guess, to understand, I guess you see very little of that coming through this year. It would seem like some would come through but very little. And then just to what degree that's caused you to build in a higher degree of elasticity into your second half assumption? I just want to get a better feel for that.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yeah. I mean it's right. Most of it will impact next year. We will get a benefit in the fourth quarter. But even a portion of that benefit, we're reinvesting in \u2013 with the trade and to drive merchandising and so forth. But most of it will impact next year. In terms of elasticity assumptions, we do have in the back half in elasticity that is a little bit better than what we've seen historically, but a little bit worse than what we saw in the first half. It actually looks a lot like the second quarter, if you adjusted for the volume replenishment, that level of elasticity is the assumption for the back half. And then, of course, the range on guidance kind of goes up and down from there.\nChris Growe: Okay. And then one related question to that would be, do you expect pricing to sequentially accelerate in the second quarter \u2013 I'm sorry, in the third quarter from the second quarter or maybe more Q4 with the confectionery pricing coming through? And then do you believe you can grow volume in the second half of the year? You've had some really strong volume trends to date.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. So we don't see sequential improvement in the third quarter. We do in the fourth quarter, and that's when we'll see the beginning effects of the price increase. And we don't expect to see volume growth. Again, with that elasticity impact defined with the pull forward of the inventory replenishment from the second half into the second quarter.\nChris Growe: Got it. That's all I have. Thanks so much.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Cody Ross with UBS. Please proceed with your question.\nSimon Negin: Good morning. This is Simon Negin filling in for Cody Ross. Could you give some additional detail into the delays in capacity coming online next year? Is this only impacting lease? And how much of an impact is expected?\nSteve Voskuil: The \u2013 so most of the capacity that will be coming online is focused on the core Reese's one significant component of that. I don't think we're going to be specific about exactly how much is coming on when, but that is the focus of the capacity.\nSimon Negin: Got you. And just one smaller question. Obviously, dots is demonstrating incredible growth largely distribution gains. Moving forward, do you expect a change in consumer's trialing new brands and products when budgets are squeezed more in this environment, perhaps sticking to what they're comfortable with?\nMichele Buck: It's a good question. I think across snacking, what we tend to see is consumers very much like their brands. So if you look across total food, as budgets are tighter, certainly, private label brands have grown share versus with across snacking, private label has not and consumers tend to like their brands. So I think that consumers will continue to try new brands, given that they have a real focus on brands within snacking. So we will closely monitor that. But at this point, we haven't seen any concerns around the slowdown in trial as a result of that.\nSimon Negin: Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question.\nJonathan Feeney: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. And great quarter. As far as pricing over the next 6 to 12 months, assuming we have, if we did have a moderating cost environment, how you lived through a lot of ups and downs in cost in this business. How do the \u2013 if there's been so much conversation, so much acceleration in pricing, much of that headline cost driven. How does it work \u2013 if \u2013 what changes about the conversation if costs move sharply in the other direction? Like they did in grains, for example, at least so far, off their peak? If costs moderate, how do you handle that? Do people \u2013 does it typically play out that it's increased promotion? Do you see decreased list prices, or do you see no impact in just a significant increase in gross margin? Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. I mean our focus is always on driving profitable category growth and looking at how we can invest to do so. We have a deep list of investment priorities and growth driving opportunities and so we believe that this enables us to really invest to unlock whether that is in capacity, whether that is in the right consumer marketing support, whether that is in more impactful promotions, investments in innovation, technology, et cetera. So, we like to invest back in the business. And I would say that's the overall approach and strategy that we take.\nJonathan Feeney: Okay. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to pass the floor back over to Michele Buck for any closing comments.\nMichele Buck: Thank you very much for your time today. We appreciate all the questions, and I know that many of you will have follow-ups with Melissa throughout the day. So thanks.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "Yeah, that's exactly right, Andrew. We saw a pretty strong inventory replenishment in the second quarter as we commented.

            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Good morning. Yeah, absolutely. As we have always talked about our investment model or our model and running the businesses, we strongly believe in investing to drive the top line and with our strong margins that enables us on the bottom line. So we always want to be spending to the consumer advertising our brands, having the right levels of promotion, the right levels of innovation. And as we mentioned earlier, given some of those supply constraints, we did have to pull off on that a bit just because it didn't make sense to make those investments given some of those constraints. But we very much look forward to re-upping the investments as we look at the second half. We have always planned an increase both in DMEs as well as incremental merchandising coming back online. Hi, Alexia. I mean I'd say, generally, we continue to see struggles across the supply chain. How I'd characterize it is what those are have evolved. So where we are now, I would say, early on, it was some of the basic logistics issues largely driven by labor. And as we've evolved, I'd say, we're now starting to see bigger concerns relative to scarcity of ingredients, needing to leverage different suppliers at higher costs and price points in order to secure production and then also the geopolitical environment has put certain strains on the business. Certainly, the Ukraine-Russia issue created some scarcity and issue with ingredients. And more recently, there have been additional restrictions from Russia on the EU relative to natural gas. Germany will be impacted. That's an area where we source a lot of equipment, supplies, as do many of our suppliers. So I would say that that's kind of evolved. Steve, would you add anything to that? I guess I'd also just add, we have made significant progress in investments in capacity, significant investments. And so part of our short-term pain was once you make those investments, it takes some time to get them up and running to get to the lines actually in place. And so part of some of the relief we're seeing is the gradual coming online of those capabilities as well, which is helpful. India is still relatively very small for us, growing high double digits. But back when we really made our decisions on China and India, for me, the key difference in India is the cost of doing business in that market is very different. So media costs, labor costs. And so in both markets, we thought we had the potential to drive top line. But as we really did assessment and looked at the NPV of our investment, India is a market that we feel good about our prospects of getting to profitable growth. Frankly, we're already in a place that we like relative to where gross margins are on that business, very different than where we ever were in China. Hi. You bet. So Ken, as we look at the business, we had a strategy of prioritizing every day on-shelf availability. It was a tough decision to balance that with the seasons, but we thought that was really important. And so that was a choice that we needed to make. We had opportunity to deliver more Halloween, but we weren't able to supply that. And we were really producing. We began producing Halloween back in the spring. And that's really when we needed to make these key decisions on what we were going to produce, so tough trade out to make. We feel really good about having high single-digit growth, but we also feel good about as we get into the future being able to have more capacity to really fulfill more of the demand that we see during the season. Hi, Jason. Yeah. So capacity is constrained, but obviously in certain parts of the portfolio, more than others. So there are certain places we have no constraints and there are other places that we are more constrained. We've shared previously that Reese's is one of the areas where we have seen high double-digit growth for extended periods of time. It's our very largest brand. So that's certainly been a pressure point. And then there are a few other places that have been pressure points and where we've needed to make trade-offs in order to prioritize some parts of the portfolio. So we continue to work through a capacity investment plan to address where the soft areas are and bring capacity online. So that might be part of the mixed messaging is there are certain places we're not constrained others that we are. Refreshment specifically Icebreakers Mint is one area where we had some production difficulties as we ramped production back up after the COVID softness. And so that's one place as well that we're continuing to work to get more supply available. Does that help? So as we get through the issues, I would say we're making -- I would characterize it as gradual improvement. Certainly, we are, I would say, quite constrained this year. We see that gradually improving as we get through 2023. And as we get to 2024, we feel much better about our ability to be able to fully meet demand. So that's how I would characterize it. Steve, anything... If it helps. The investments that we made will result in about a 15% increase in our internal volume production capability. That should allow us to catch up but also to deliver some of that future growth. And Jason, if I would just add a little bit was just related to some of the pricing that's in the marketplace and expecting to come, trying to put that in perspective around how much 2023 factored into that choice and just trying to make sure that everybody was understanding some of the inflation that we see coming in 2023 to help put some of that pricing in perspective as well. Good morning. Thanks. Good morning. Sure. So we are absolutely very pleased with Dot's performance in the marketplace and the momentum that we see. I think what we're really happy about is we continue to gain distribution, but we are maintaining our velocities as we continue to broaden reach. And that can be a challenge to do as you continue to broaden reach into sometimes some of the smaller accounts. So all the trends are in line with our expectations. Retail sales growing about 50% over the past 12 weeks, share up about 370 basis points. We are right now lapping some large distribution increases from prior year. So we do expect to see a little bit of softening in trend as we overlap that, but we do have continued distribution upside as we took over the business, the distribution was really concentrated primarily in the center of the country and the West. And we're really still filling out the East and importantly, just making sure that we have the right placement in stores and then, of course, beginning to actually market and drive consumer messaging to the brand, which we help think will further drive upside in velocities. Our recent announced pricing action is being executed. It is going as planned, and we're starting to see some of the new retails in the market already. We feel good that we really took a consumer focused approach for the right retail price points, and we're also beginning to reset some of the promotional points. So overall, the prices are moving in line with our recommendations and our expected ranges. And we are pleased about that as we want to really move ahead with further investments in the business and capacity and consumer spending, new capabilities and the right programming and all of this will allow us to do that to drive profitable category growth. Good morning. It's a good question. I think across snacking, what we tend to see is consumers very much like their brands. So if you look across total food, as budgets are tighter, certainly, private label brands have grown share versus with across snacking, private label has not and consumers tend to like their brands. So I think that consumers will continue to try new brands, given that they have a real focus on brands within snacking. So we will closely monitor that. But at this point, we haven't seen any concerns around the slowdown in trial as a result of that. Yeah. I mean our focus is always on driving profitable category growth and looking at how we can invest to do so. We have a deep list of investment priorities and growth driving opportunities and so we believe that this enables us to really invest to unlock whether that is in capacity, whether that is in the right consumer marketing support, whether that is in more impactful promotions, investments in innovation, technology, et cetera. So, we like to invest back in the business. And I would say that's the overall approach and strategy that we take. Thank you very much for your time today. We appreciate all the questions, and I know that many of you will have follow-ups with Melissa throughout the day. So thanks."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. Please go ahead.\nMelissa Poole: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company\u2019s first quarter 2022 earnings Q&A session.

Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. [Operator Instructions] The first question is coming from Andrew Lazar of Barclays. Please go ahead. Andrew, your line is live. Please make sure you're not muted on your end.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning, everybody. Can you hear me?\nOperator: Yes, we can hear you.\nMelissa Poole: Yes, yes, we can.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thank you. I guess, first off by our estimate, it seems like you're raising full year organic sales by essentially the over delivery in the first quarter, meeting expectations for the remainder of the year haven't changed. Is that the way you're looking at it? And if so, I guess, why is that given the momentum in the business? And I realize you'll start to lapse some of the pricing as the year unfolds.\nMichele Buck: Hey Andrew, good morning. I'm going to kick it off with a few responses and ask Steve to jump in as well. So first of all, I'd say we are really pleased with our first quarter results and the momentum that we see on the business. But it is pretty early in the year still. And as we all know, we continue to see significant volatility in the marketplace, whether it's record inflation, the Ukraine-Russia situation, continued disruption in the supply chain. As we dissect the business in the first quarter, clearly within the first quarter, the large majority of our sales were related to stronger elasticities that have been realized in the marketplace. But we do anticipate as we look further out in the year that we'll see some moderation on those elasticities, perhaps back to more historic levels. And a lot of that is driven by that reduction in government subsidies and the continued inflation pressure that we think consumers will experience. There was another component of our Q1 sales beat that was about a raise, that was about Dot's and our ability to really get our arms around the Dot's business and better understand what we thought it could deliver for the year. We have pretty good visibility into that. So we feel like the number there is pretty good. And then lastly, as we look at inventory, we've been really working hard to build inventory and we did get more inventory out to retail. We made a decision to do that in Q1 to really try and increase on-shelf availability. So from a sales perspective, as we look at what we realized versus how we think that will impact back half of the year, we think the strength in Q1 from sales is much stronger, but Steve, do you want to comment more about that and also relative to the constant profit situation.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, on the top line, I think you hit all the key points. The inventory piece was about a three point benefit to the first quarter. That'll come out in the back half. So that's one of the unique things, I guess, that drove the first quarter performance. And then Michele touched on the elasticities, we saw big benefit in the first quarter. We do expect to see elasticities normalize a bit as we go forward quarter-by-quarter through the year so those are probably the two biggest things that's soften a little bit of the outlook on the top line.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. And then I guess, the second one would be sort of a similar thought process, but more on the EPS side, obviously the first quarter came in some $0.40 higher than the Street and raising the full year by $0.07. Maybe can you bridge that gap for us a little bit? Are you trying to be just somewhat conservative in your thought process given obviously an increasingly dynamic environment, which makes total sense or are there some other things that are more discreet that we want to make sure to keep in mind on the profit side? Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yes. The biggest driver for first quarter earnings was that volume \u2013 4.5 points volume in the quarter that dropped through to earnings. So that was the biggest factor. And there were some unique pieces as well. I think we called out a couple in the remarks. One was inventory reevaluation, which is sort of an unusual thing. We see it in times of higher inflation which has the impact of giving a benefit to the P&L and putting more cost on the balance sheet to reflect the cost of goods value there. So that was 100 basis points to the confection segment in this quarter that won't repeat going forward. And as you said, we do expect more year to go inflation. In the first quarter saw a little bit of that incremental inflation, but as we look forward, despite the hedging that we have in place, we're still going to have some incremental exposure, particularly to the commodities impacted by the events in Eastern Ukraine \u2013 or Eastern Europe, sorry.\nAndrew Lazar: Thank you so much.\nMichele Buck: Thanks Andrew.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Robert Moskow of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks for the question. There's a lot of detail in the prepared remarks about competitive activity that caused you to lose some market share during the Easter and your capacity constraints that led to that. As we head into Halloween, are you in a position to ramp up sufficiently so that you can hold your share? And the reason I ask is I remember during the pandemic, Halloween was a real tipping point for your distribution with retailers. You gained a lot of Goodwill after that. You gained a lot of distribution, are you in a position so that that there's no risk of that reversing?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So Rob clearly over the past two years, we have had some nice gains in share and certainly those have contracted recently given some of the capacity pressure. I think we're up about 50 basis points versus where we were pre-pandemic and our share versus our next largest competitor that gap has clearly widened and remains pretty strong about 200 basis points ahead of pre-pandemic levels. We are doing everything we can relative to building capacity, investing in new lines, distribution centers, hiring more people to build our supply as much as possible and working really closely with retailers as well on our plans for Halloween right now. So we expect that as we go through the year, we will continue to have supply challenges, although they will improve as we progress throughout the year. And we're working a hard to maximize the opportunity for Halloween.\nRobert Moskow: Well, Halloween commitments are probably made pretty early. Can you give us any color as to what you're able to commit to right now?\nMichele Buck: So we believe that just as we've seen strengths in the seasons over the past two years that we will continue to see strengths in the seasons throughout the year. This year we've seen it in Easter, but at this point in time, we're not going to give any more specifics on exactly what those growth numbers are going to be. I guess, I would say overall, what I would say is we're not really seeing any big changes in how our competitors are operating or in their strategies. So really it's a focus on us continuing to build supply. Over the past two years, we grew pounds about 7% versus our competitors in the marketplace collectively had a 1% decline in pounds. So we are just a little tighter on supplying capacity than the environment.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thanks for the question.\nMichele Buck: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Ken Goldman of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Goldman: Hi, thank you. I wanted to ask about the margins and profitability in Salty Snacks. Steve, you gave a helpful explanation of a lot of the reasons behind, maybe what could be considered a little sluggishness versus what people were looking for, but I'm curious, to what extent did it fall below your expectations, if at all, what were the key drivers of that shortfall if there was one? And how quickly might we see a little bit of a rebound there?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, thanks Ken. Yes, it was sluggish from our side as well. Some of the margin degradation we expected. So the mix piece that we called out, obviously, as we brought Dot's into that portfolio. We also planned on higher raw materials for the portfolio for the year, but the incremental inflation that we've seen more recently again following the events in Eastern Europe are falling more into the Salty Snack space. So thinking cooking oil, wheat, and then just the smaller business impact on oil price flowing through that P&L so that was I could say a surprise piece relative to the raw material side. We're also in the process of starting up a new distribution center that began in the first quarter, we'll continue through the second quarter. And I'd say the startup there's been a little bit bumpier than we expected, although we're working our way through it and expect to see improvement as we go through with the next quarter. And then we did have also some higher advertising expense in the first quarter and that will moderate. That was part of the plan to spend more in the first quarter in part to offset some of the elasticity due to price increases there, which I think we've done a good job of because that business is growing strong double-digits, but we'll see that begin to moderate as we get to the next couple of quarter. So if I kind of point to the things that were a bit unusual, I'd say the DC startup, the incremental inflation, and probably higher advertising spend that we would normally see in that business.\nKen Goldman: Thank you. And just a quick follow up. I know these things are hard to sort of parse out, but is there any way to think about what the gross margin roughly might have been in the first quarter, if you were to exclude the inventory fill, you may have called that out and I missed it. I'm just curious for an estimate there.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. We didn't go that far in the remark and sort of back into what it might have been. What I would say is we talked about this a little bit on the last call as well. The opportunity here is really to optimize the new snacking division. So as we look at, even the work we're doing with the distribution center that's all pointed towards driving network efficiency. We're going to be working through supply chain efficiencies and of course, eventually back office efficiencies as well. And so we continue to be excited about the opportunity to drop more margin out of that business as we gain scale and get some of those integration points together.\nKen Goldman: Thanks so much.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jason English of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJason English: Hey, good morning, folks. Thanks for letting me in.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nJason English: Couple questions. So first snack margins, I think you said you had about 500 basis points degradation from mix. I imagine a good chunk of that's coming from the manufacturing asset you picked up. So question on that, how much snack capacities in that asset and you mentioned in prepared remarks that you're beginning to lean in and start producing some of your other snack items on that network, how much can you move over and how far can you shrink that 500 bps as you improve asset utilization and presumably migrate production from outsource providers to in-source?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, so a couple things there. One, inside that makes us also the amortization, the incremental amortization that deals with. So not all of it is capacity related. That's going to be around for a while obviously. As we look at combining supply chains, those assets are pretty well utilized. They were a little bit less utilized in the first quarter than will be for the balance of the year. But we continue to see opportunities to continue to leverage those assets. They've got some world-class manufacturing assets. That's one of the reasons we are able to bring a Pirate Booty asset into that mix as early as we did. And we want \u2013 the plan is to see more of that sort of consolidated manufacturing. And so, we'd expect to see some mitigation of that mix impact as we continue to leverage those assets and drive more volume through that system.\nJason English: Got it. And back to the comments on market share attributed to capacity constraints. I just pulled your brand level data just to get a snapshot of like, which brands are holding you back a bit. And it's brands like Kit Kat, Reese\u2019s, Twizzler, those don't seem like the types of brands you'd be capacity constrained on, are they \u2013 or where are the capacity constraints?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So our biggest capacity constraint is really on Reese and some of our assorted bags, but primarily Reese as you know, Reese is our biggest brand by far, it's over \u2013 it's a couple billion dollars in size and when it is growing double-digits, as it has been and had such a track record of strong growth that is \u2013 that's where some of the biggest rub and the biggest dollar opportunity that we're focused on. And then some of our other take home brands, obviously given the strength of consumers now consuming at-home, there's a lot of pressure on some of the brands in terms of how they show up in take home and that's spread across a number of different brands.\nJason English: Got it. Okay. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Alexia Howard of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Okay, so a couple of questions here. The Dot's Pretzel acquisition, obviously incredibly strong growth year-on-year that you reported in the remarks, could you talk about the distribution opportunity, where is the ACV at the moment, where could it get to? I mean, is this something that I guess how large is the opportunity, we'll start there.\nMichele Buck: Yes, so we are continuing to build distribution on Dot's. So clearly as we're acquiring the brand, the distribution remains skewed to kind of the West Coast, the middle of the country. And we've had a big focus on trying to close the distribution gap on the East Coast in particular and then to also fill in, in some of the key retailers and classes of trades throughout. So it's been a constant build. We had a lot of distribution growth in Q1, and I believe that we're in the mid-70s right now on distribution. So there remains some upside that we're experiencing now, we continue to drive through the back part of the year. So we continue gain household penetration as a result of that. And that continue \u2013 as more consumers find out about the brand, household awareness of the brand continues to be low. And we see that as a key opportunity as well.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And then can I ask about on a different topic, on the C-store dynamics, there have been concerns in the past that when gasoline prices spike that leads to fewer trips and therefore that hits your C-store sales. Can you talk about what you're seeing in that segment and whether that's the case this time around or if you're seeing something different. Thank you. And I'll pass it on.\nMichele Buck: Yes. So we have seen some changes in consumer behavior within convenience stores, as gas prices have risen. But what we're seeing is that many consumers seem to be trying to manage the higher price by not fully filling their tanks. So they're making more trips but just not filling as full. And to-date, they have not reduce their non-gas purchases in a meaningful way. And we haven't seen an impact. Our business remains quite strong in convenience stores. So we haven't really seen an impact on our business that we do expect that these trends will continue to evolve as we see some of those pressures we talked about earlier relative to reduction in government subsidies and the continued persistence of inflation and the impact on consumers.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nMichele Buck: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks operator. Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nBryan Spillane: I had just one question and it's around inflation in gross margins. So can you just help a little bit with based on the incremental inflation you saw in the first quarter, you've widened your expectation for growth margins changed, is we're kind of looking at this kind of moving even past the fiscal year. Like what will you be able to do to begin to mitigate or offset that margin pressure? Is it going to be as some of this new capacity, come on, there's more efficiencies, is pricing potentially a lever in the mix, just really trying to understand as we move forward, are you going to be able to mitigate that margin pressure?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. It\u2019s really all of those Bryan. We\u2019re certainly going to look at all our usual levers, driving productivity and efficiency from a manufacturing standpoint. And we will see more of that as we get more scale and more assets coming online. So that\u2019ll be a factor. But we \u2013 pricing is always part of our strategy. We look at it all the time. We\u2019re very sensitive to both the consumer and what\u2019s happening from a cost \u2013 input cost standpoint. And we\u2019ll continue to look at that as we think about our plan for next year.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. But as it stands now, you haven\u2019t contemplated or you haven\u2019t embedded in the guidance isn\u2019t any incremental pricing actions or other actions to offset that inflation. You\u2019re just absorbing the inflation right now.\nSteve Voskuil: That\u2019s right. What\u2019s in the outlook right now is the pricing that we\u2019ve already announced that flowing through the P&L for the year.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Perfect. All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Michael Lavery of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: I know the gas price increases is a factor that may make it a little bit harder to tease this out or really recognize it. But can you talk about mobility? And just some of the consumer patterns you\u2019re seeing there as things are reopening more, consumers are getting out more. How does that impact some of your obviously higher margin instant consumable products? Are you seeing any shifts or anything that\u2019s notable in terms of the mix of what they\u2019re buying and where?\nMichele Buck: So, yes, we definitely are seeing consumer mobility has returned its strong, it\u2019s interesting. It\u2019s certainly dialed up versus what it was before. And at the same time, we\u2019re still seeing a lot of interest in some of the at-home behaviors where people haven\u2019t totally returned to some things like restaurants and some activities, frankly, not as much because of COVID a little bit more because of some of the price pressure of inflation. So we are seeing some consumers try to consolidate trips, but we haven\u2019t really seen a meaningful impact to our total trips. And we\u2019ve been looking across each class of trade. I\u2019d say food is strong, has accelerated, C-store I mentioned before, quite strong, which is a key indicator of mobility. But really across most classes of trade dollar, mass, food and C-store, the trends remain quite strong.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just on international, those margins were better than expected and very strong. That segment has some pretty significant seasonality. But can you just help us understand some of what\u2019s driving that and how to think about the rest of the year? Is it likely to keep up some of those gains? Or what\u2019s the right way to frame how that plays out over the course of the year.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. The business has done really well. All of our core markets had double digit top line growth, so that was a good starting point. And then we\u2019re still seeing through the first quarter, the last bits of some of the restructuring that we did in China. So that\u2019s giving a little bit of an incremental benefit to the first quarter that I would say is probably not going to be a year-over-year component going forward. But I would also commend the international team for looking at the whole P&L and managing their cost structure and executing a smart pricing strategy as well.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Cody Ross of UBS. Please go ahead.\nCody Ross: Good morning, everyone and thank you for taking our questions. You just noted that you don\u2019t plan on taking additional pricing the rest of the year. However, most companies that have already reported this season discuss taking additional pricing. Why is that?\nMichele Buck: We remain very confident in our pricing strategy and our ability to get price realization. As Steve mentioned, what you\u2019re seeing in our P&L right now is the pricing that we announced last year flowing through into the business. We all know that this remains a volatile environment. The cost side has continued to evolve, especially with continued supply chain pressure and also the Ukraine-Russia situation. And as always, we will continue to look at every lever at our disposal as we always do to make the best decisions for the business.\nCody Ross: Got you. And then you noted the Russian-Ukrainian war is affecting supply availability. Are there any commodities you can call out that you\u2019re having difficulty securing? And do you expect to have any issues securing supply for balance of the year? Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. At this stage \u2013 taking the last part first, we don\u2019t foresee a challenge and availability for the balance of this year. Where we\u2019ve probably seen the most pressure is in the cooking oil space. A lot of that source out of Eastern Europe but our business is resilient and we\u2019ve got other sources and other solutions that working through to ensure that we be able to satisfy consumer needs, even if we face some more pressure next year on that commodity.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll move on to the next question, which is coming from Chris Growe of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nChris Growe: Hi. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nChris Growe: Good morning. I just had a question for you. Just to follow-up on the fact you\u2019re able to rebuild some inventory this quarter. It sounds like you\u2019re going to have some more in the second quarter now, and it\u2019s more heavily favored towards the first half. I just want to be \u2013 so before we had thought about that happening in the second half, do you continue to build inventory in the second half? And I guess what I\u2019m ultimately getting to is when can you start \u2013 will you be at a point where you can start to market and promote more normally like you had historically?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. We\u2019re going to continue to build inventory. We\u2019re going to see \u2013 you should see sequential improvement more for this year pulled this first half. But we want to continue to build inventory. And as Michele said earlier, and we\u2019ve got a lot of capacity coming online, the first quarter was our highest production quarter ever. And as we get more capacity coming online, we expect to see that build and be able to catch up both on our own internal inventory and trade and retail inventory.\nChris Growe: And then is that \u2013 can marketing start like more aggressively this year? Or is this more like next year?\nSteve Voskuil: Well, we\u2019re going to make sure that we\u2019re fully participating in seasons. Just as we talked about earlier with Halloween and make sure that we\u2019re getting all of our products out of inventory and onto the shelves as quickly as we can so that we can continue to support the brand. And we\u2019ll see more of that support pickup as we get to the back half of the year.\nChris Growe: Okay. And just one follow-up question on the gross margin. You have a little more aggressive decline, because of the increase in costs that you expect now for the year. Is that any differently weighted by quarter? Is Q2 any worse or Q3? It caused me to have to bring my estimates down for the remainder of the year for the gross margin, given how strong it was here in the first quarter. I just want to get a sense of how that plays out across the rest of the year. Is it just a timing of inflation that will dictate sort of the quarterly progression in the gross margin?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. I\u2019d say it\u2019s mostly that. As we look at our plan, we probably see the most pressure in quarter two, but then begins to improve because the last get a little bit easier. So if I had to pick a quarter, I\u2019d probably say quarter two would be the worst.\nChris Growe: Okay. Thanks so much for your time.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nSteve Powers: Great. Thank you. Two questions actually. The first one just to build on the gross margins theme. The prepared remarks suggest to call out the 120 to 140 basis points of contraction, but then equate that with gross profit dollars increasing mid single digits, my math may be wrong, but I think given your top line that seems a pretty conservative combination of top line and gross margins. So just wanted to get some color on that mid single digit dollar profit growth language in the prepared marks. And then secondly, you call out seeing some impact in certain consumer goods categories from the inflation that we\u2019re all seeing and from the declining government assistance that\u2019s occurring. I was hoping you could just give a little bit more color as to what specifically you\u2019re seeing and how you\u2019re monitoring that going forward. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. On the first part of that question, there\u2019s no intentional conservatism between what we are seeing on the top line and what we\u2019re seeing on the gross margin line. And so it should tie, but technically we should see about 7% gross profit growth mid \u2013 kind of mid high single digit range growth. And I think that math will work, but happy to take that on the side, if we want to go into more detail.\nSteve Powers: Mid to high makes sense. Sorry, mid to high makes sense. Just the language in the text actually just says mid. So thank you for clarifying.\nSteve Voskuil: Yep.\nMichele Buck: And on your other question, we are constantly looking at a couple things relative to the strength of retail takeaway in other CPG categories, as well as our own. And also how much market share is going to private label as that has typically also been a predictor of the consumer. We\u2019re fortunate in our category, not to have significant private label, but certainly in other categories where that\u2019s present we do look at that as well.\nSteve Powers: Okay. Very good. Thank you for that. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from Jonathan Feeney of Consumer Edge. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Feeney: Good morning. Thanks. A question and maybe a follow-up all at one. The question is, you guided us on the magnitude of this retailer inventory replacement for the full year. But has that grown significantly with the better than expected experience in the first quarter, not only in your brands, but across the category to the elasticity. I can\u2019t imagine retailers and your competitors thought the uptake to this magnitude of pricing would be that good. I mean, maybe I\u2019m wrong about that. So that is my first part \u2013 my first question. And then how does Easter play into that? Because you called out in your prepared remarks that people were buying more every day product because of the shortages of Easter product. And that certainly seems to be born out in the data. I wonder, doesn\u2019t that add to the retailer inventory need going forward and maybe augment the opportunity to fill to greater levels throughout the year, not just what you had talked about it, and you may be pulling it forward from your prior guidance on inventory fill. Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil: Taking the last bit first. Yes, Easter will \u2013 the Easter sell through was high. We saw more every day takeaway. And that will put more pressure on retailer and trade inventory. So that will happen. As we look at the full year though, we still \u2013 I said, we\u2019re not seeing a fundamental shift in what we had planned relative to being able to restock. As we said earlier, we got to benefit in the first quarter, we pushed more out. The elasticity has put for the full year a bit more volume through. And so that\u2019s true. But also, we have \u2013 we expect to see additional production pick up as we go through the year to help compensate that to some degree. So I think net-net it\u2019s not a big change in total. But to your point, the sell through on Easter is going to put a little bit more pressure on some trade inventory.\nJonathan Feeney: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from John Baumgartner of Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.\nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning. Thanks for the question.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nJohn Baumgartner: Michele, one standout over the past two years has been your increases in share of distribution points, whether it be chocolate or non-chocolate candy. And I can appreciate the capacity constraints right now sort of work against that. But putting that aside, how are you thinking about the resources to sustain and grow as capacity improves? I mean, just given all the upheavals over the past two years, whether it\u2019s more promotion, more in-store sales force hours, more advertising investment. Where \u2013 how do you see those levers of engagement requiring change in a post-COVID world?\nMichele Buck: Boy, I\u2019d say, my first answer to that question is the resources to sustain and grow are in supply chain building capacity to really be able to drive against the very strong demand. So probably first and foremost, I think that\u2019s the focus. I believe we have the retail resources that we need from a sales perspective. Our sales organization, from a marketing capability, I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s maybe as much about people we\u2019ve continued to invest in capability with a new media partner, better targeting capabilities. Certainly that helps us to really maximize consumer demand and then maintaining the strong relationships that we have with retailers and just continue to evolve the total bundle of investment we have to drive against demand with our retailers and our consumers. But right now I think we\u2019re focused really on supply chain, hiring more people in manufacturing facilities, engineers to execute the capacity work. That\u2019s really where the focus is.\nJohn Baumgartner: And I guess, just sticking with that theme on supply chain. You\u2019ve done a lot of work there, adding manufacturing lines, fulfilment center and so on. And I guess, weak link is probably too strong of a term. But where do you think the supply chain still needs more work right now, whether it\u2019s modernization, automation. Just outsize, does it increases on capacity? What sort of is kind the next phase of I guess, evolution there?\nMichele Buck: Well, clearly as we are executing this capacity and looking at the future, automation, yes is a big lever across the business. We still have opportunities in some of our manufacturing facilities for what we call single point of automation, say an automated case pack or whatever the basic automation is. And then we kind of go to the connectivity of all the different parts of our system, talking to each other. And across our entire business, not just supply chain, we continue to look at opportunities where technology can allow us to operate more efficiently, give us better insights, et cetera. And then certainly as we look at our Salty business, now that we are gaining more scale and have many more businesses in that portfolio. As Steve mentioned earlier, we\u2019re doing a lot of work on just optimizing the overall supply chain network and what that looks like. And that\u2019s more efficient distribution. It is more efficient manufacturing, really across the board and that\u2019s somewhat of a transformation.\nJohn Baumgartner: Okay. Thanks, Michele.\nMichele Buck: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is coming from David Palmer of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Just a quick question about scanner data. It looks like Hershey\u2019s behind some of the competitors in pricing, although we don\u2019t always see a perfect lens into what actual list pricing is. Do you think that that Hershey\u2019s behind the competition when it comes to list price increases lately? Or are we just seeing some noise in there?\nMichele Buck: Yes. I don\u2019t believe we are behind. This is a category where it tends to be line priced. It\u2019s really noise related to Easter and just the mix of items that vary across different competitors during the Easter timeframe. I think as we go forward, you\u2019ll see that really even out.\nDavid Palmer: And then just a question on advertising and promotions those were down lately, sort of understandable given the capacity constraints. But what\u2019s your outlook for advertising spend? And then maybe you can layer on top of that your general philosophy and what you\u2019re thinking there? One thought is, you might layer in as your capacity increases some more advertising, but some of the industry are talking about digital marketing becoming more expensive and maybe lower ROI. So just any thoughts on that would be helpful.\nMichele Buck: Okay. So, we are big believers in advertising. I think we\u2019ve talked a lot about our model is we are pleased to have some of the strongest gross margins in the end of street, and we believe in the model and then using some of those funds to reinvest in our brands and be one of the highest investors in the industry. It\u2019s a highly responsive category with a strong impulsive nature as well. As you look to the rest of the year, we believe we will be up mid to high single digits and we will continue to invest as we expand capacity wherever we can because we\u2019re big believers. Media efficiencies have really helped us to control the dollar cost because as a result of a new partnership and also new capabilities, we\u2019ve gotten more efficiencies in our media. I think from a philosophy perspective, relative to your question about digital. We have not seen decline in list and return. And I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s \u2013 if they\u2019re being offset because we\u2019ve built capabilities, new capabilities to better target. And so we\u2019re actually seeing a stronger targeting capability and thus better efficiency.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Ms. Poole for closing comments.\nMelissa Poole: Thank you for joining us this morning. I will be available throughout the day and tomorrow for any follow-up questions you may have. Thank you for your time this morning.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s event. You may disconnect your lines or log off the webcast at this time and enjoy the rest of your day.",

            "name": "Steve Voskuil",
            "content": "Yes, on the top line, I think you hit all the key points. The inventory piece was about a three point benefit to the first quarter. That'll come out in the back half. So that's one of the unique things, I guess, that drove the first quarter performance. And then Michele touched on the elasticities, we saw big benefit in the first quarter. We do expect to see elasticities normalize a bit as we go forward quarter-by-quarter through the year so those are probably the two biggest things that's soften a little bit of the outlook on the top line. Sure. Yes. The biggest driver for first quarter earnings was that volume \u2013 4.5 points volume in the quarter that dropped through to earnings. So that was the biggest factor. And there were some unique pieces as well. I think we called out a couple in the remarks. One was inventory reevaluation, which is sort of an unusual thing. We see it in times of higher inflation which has the impact of giving a benefit to the P&L and putting more cost on the balance sheet to reflect the cost of goods value there. So that was 100 basis points to the confection segment in this quarter that won't repeat going forward. And as you said, we do expect more year to go inflation. In the first quarter saw a little bit of that incremental inflation, but as we look forward, despite the hedging that we have in place, we're still going to have some incremental exposure, particularly to the commodities impacted by the events in Eastern Ukraine \u2013 or Eastern Europe, sorry. Yes, thanks Ken. Yes, it was sluggish from our side as well. Some of the margin degradation we expected. So the mix piece that we called out, obviously, as we brought Dot's into that portfolio. We also planned on higher raw materials for the portfolio for the year, but the incremental inflation that we've seen more recently again following the events in Eastern Europe are falling more into the Salty Snack space. So thinking cooking oil, wheat, and then just the smaller business impact on oil price flowing through that P&L so that was I could say a surprise piece relative to the raw material side. We're also in the process of starting up a new distribution center that began in the first quarter, we'll continue through the second quarter. And I'd say the startup there's been a little bit bumpier than we expected, although we're working our way through it and expect to see improvement as we go through with the next quarter. And then we did have also some higher advertising expense in the first quarter and that will moderate. That was part of the plan to spend more in the first quarter in part to offset some of the elasticity due to price increases there, which I think we've done a good job of because that business is growing strong double-digits, but we'll see that begin to moderate as we get to the next couple of quarter. So if I kind of point to the things that were a bit unusual, I'd say the DC startup, the incremental inflation, and probably higher advertising spend that we would normally see in that business. Yes. We didn't go that far in the remark and sort of back into what it might have been. What I would say is we talked about this a little bit on the last call as well. The opportunity here is really to optimize the new snacking division. So as we look at, even the work we're doing with the distribution center that's all pointed towards driving network efficiency. We're going to be working through supply chain efficiencies and of course, eventually back office efficiencies as well. And so we continue to be excited about the opportunity to drop more margin out of that business as we gain scale and get some of those integration points together. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, so a couple things there. One, inside that makes us also the amortization, the incremental amortization that deals with. So not all of it is capacity related. That's going to be around for a while obviously. As we look at combining supply chains, those assets are pretty well utilized. They were a little bit less utilized in the first quarter than will be for the balance of the year. But we continue to see opportunities to continue to leverage those assets. They've got some world-class manufacturing assets. That's one of the reasons we are able to bring a Pirate Booty asset into that mix as early as we did. And we want \u2013 the plan is to see more of that sort of consolidated manufacturing. And so, we'd expect to see some mitigation of that mix impact as we continue to leverage those assets and drive more volume through that system. Good morning. Yes. It's really all of those Bryan. We're certainly going to look at all our usual levers, driving productivity and efficiency from a manufacturing standpoint. And we will see more of that as we get more scale and more assets coming online. So that'll be a factor. But we \u2013 pricing is always part of our strategy. We look at it all the time. We're very sensitive to both the consumer and what's happening from a cost \u2013 input cost standpoint. And we'll continue to look at that as we think about our plan for next year. That's right. What's in the outlook right now is the pricing that we've already announced that flowing through the P&L for the year. Good morning. Yes. The business has done really well. All of our core markets had double digit top line growth, so that was a good starting point. And then we're still seeing through the first quarter, the last bits of some of the restructuring that we did in China. So that's giving a little bit of an incremental benefit to the first quarter that I would say is probably not going to be a year-over-year component going forward. But I would also commend the international team for looking at the whole P&L and managing their cost structure and executing a smart pricing strategy as well. Yes. At this stage \u2013 taking the last part first, we don't foresee a challenge and availability for the balance of this year. Where we've probably seen the most pressure is in the cooking oil space. A lot of that source out of Eastern Europe but our business is resilient and we've got other sources and other solutions that working through to ensure that we be able to satisfy consumer needs, even if we face some more pressure next year on that commodity. Good morning. Yes. We're going to continue to build inventory. We're going to see \u2013 you should see sequential improvement more for this year pulled this first half. But we want to continue to build inventory. And as Michele said earlier, and we've got a lot of capacity coming online, the first quarter was our highest production quarter ever. And as we get more capacity coming online, we expect to see that build and be able to catch up both on our own internal inventory and trade and retail inventory. Well, we're going to make sure that we're fully participating in seasons. Just as we talked about earlier with Halloween and make sure that we're getting all of our products out of inventory and onto the shelves as quickly as we can so that we can continue to support the brand. And we'll see more of that support pickup as we get to the back half of the year. Yes. I'd say it's mostly that. As we look at our plan, we probably see the most pressure in quarter two, but then begins to improve because the last get a little bit easier. So if I had to pick a quarter, I'd probably say quarter two would be the worst. Sure. On the first part of that question, there's no intentional conservatism between what we are seeing on the top line and what we're seeing on the gross margin line. And so it should tie, but technically we should see about 7% gross profit growth mid \u2013 kind of mid high single digit range growth. And I think that math will work, but happy to take that on the side, if we want to go into more detail. Yep. Taking the last bit first. Yes, Easter will \u2013 the Easter sell through was high. We saw more every day takeaway. And that will put more pressure on retailer and trade inventory. So that will happen. As we look at the full year though, we still \u2013 I said, we're not seeing a fundamental shift in what we had planned relative to being able to restock. As we said earlier, we got to benefit in the first quarter, we pushed more out. The elasticity has put for the full year a bit more volume through. And so that's true. But also, we have \u2013 we expect to see additional production pick up as we go through the year to help compensate that to some degree. So I think net-net it's not a big change in total. But to your point, the sell through on Easter is going to put a little bit more pressure on some trade inventory."

            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Hey Andrew, good morning. I'm going to kick it off with a few responses and ask Steve to jump in as well. So first of all, I'd say we are really pleased with our first quarter results and the momentum that we see on the business. But it is pretty early in the year still. And as we all know, we continue to see significant volatility in the marketplace, whether it's record inflation, the Ukraine-Russia situation, continued disruption in the supply chain. As we dissect the business in the first quarter, clearly within the first quarter, the large majority of our sales were related to stronger elasticities that have been realized in the marketplace. But we do anticipate as we look further out in the year that we'll see some moderation on those elasticities, perhaps back to more historic levels. And a lot of that is driven by that reduction in government subsidies and the continued inflation pressure that we think consumers will experience. There was another component of our Q1 sales beat that was about a raise, that was about Dot's and our ability to really get our arms around the Dot's business and better understand what we thought it could deliver for the year. We have pretty good visibility into that. So we feel like the number there is pretty good. And then lastly, as we look at inventory, we've been really working hard to build inventory and we did get more inventory out to retail. We made a decision to do that in Q1 to really try and increase on-shelf availability. So from a sales perspective, as we look at what we realized versus how we think that will impact back half of the year, we think the strength in Q1 from sales is much stronger, but Steve, do you want to comment more about that and also relative to the constant profit situation. Thanks Andrew. Yes. So Rob clearly over the past two years, we have had some nice gains in share and certainly those have contracted recently given some of the capacity pressure. I think we're up about 50 basis points versus where we were pre-pandemic and our share versus our next largest competitor that gap has clearly widened and remains pretty strong about 200 basis points ahead of pre-pandemic levels. We are doing everything we can relative to building capacity, investing in new lines, distribution centers, hiring more people to build our supply as much as possible and working really closely with retailers as well on our plans for Halloween right now. So we expect that as we go through the year, we will continue to have supply challenges, although they will improve as we progress throughout the year. And we're working a hard to maximize the opportunity for Halloween. So we believe that just as we've seen strengths in the seasons over the past two years that we will continue to see strengths in the seasons throughout the year. This year we've seen it in Easter, but at this point in time, we're not going to give any more specifics on exactly what those growth numbers are going to be. I guess, I would say overall, what I would say is we're not really seeing any big changes in how our competitors are operating or in their strategies. So really it's a focus on us continuing to build supply. Over the past two years, we grew pounds about 7% versus our competitors in the marketplace collectively had a 1% decline in pounds. So we are just a little tighter on supplying capacity than the environment. Thank you. Good morning. Yes. So our biggest capacity constraint is really on Reese and some of our assorted bags, but primarily Reese as you know, Reese is our biggest brand by far, it's over \u2013 it's a couple billion dollars in size and when it is growing double-digits, as it has been and had such a track record of strong growth that is \u2013 that's where some of the biggest rub and the biggest dollar opportunity that we're focused on. And then some of our other take home brands, obviously given the strength of consumers now consuming at-home, there's a lot of pressure on some of the brands in terms of how they show up in take home and that's spread across a number of different brands. Good morning. Yes, so we are continuing to build distribution on Dot's. So clearly as we're acquiring the brand, the distribution remains skewed to kind of the West Coast, the middle of the country. And we've had a big focus on trying to close the distribution gap on the East Coast in particular and then to also fill in, in some of the key retailers and classes of trades throughout. So it's been a constant build. We had a lot of distribution growth in Q1, and I believe that we're in the mid-70s right now on distribution. So there remains some upside that we're experiencing now, we continue to drive through the back part of the year. So we continue gain household penetration as a result of that. And that continue \u2013 as more consumers find out about the brand, household awareness of the brand continues to be low. And we see that as a key opportunity as well. Yes. So we have seen some changes in consumer behavior within convenience stores, as gas prices have risen. But what we're seeing is that many consumers seem to be trying to manage the higher price by not fully filling their tanks. So they're making more trips but just not filling as full. And to-date, they have not reduce their non-gas purchases in a meaningful way. And we haven't seen an impact. Our business remains quite strong in convenience stores. So we haven't really seen an impact on our business that we do expect that these trends will continue to evolve as we see some of those pressures we talked about earlier relative to reduction in government subsidies and the continued persistence of inflation and the impact on consumers. Thanks. Good morning. Good morning. So, yes, we definitely are seeing consumer mobility has returned its strong, it's interesting. It's certainly dialed up versus what it was before. And at the same time, we're still seeing a lot of interest in some of the at-home behaviors where people haven't totally returned to some things like restaurants and some activities, frankly, not as much because of COVID a little bit more because of some of the price pressure of inflation. So we are seeing some consumers try to consolidate trips, but we haven't really seen a meaningful impact to our total trips. And we've been looking across each class of trade. I'd say food is strong, has accelerated, C-store I mentioned before, quite strong, which is a key indicator of mobility. But really across most classes of trade dollar, mass, food and C-store, the trends remain quite strong. We remain very confident in our pricing strategy and our ability to get price realization. As Steve mentioned, what you're seeing in our P&L right now is the pricing that we announced last year flowing through into the business. We all know that this remains a volatile environment. The cost side has continued to evolve, especially with continued supply chain pressure and also the Ukraine-Russia situation. And as always, we will continue to look at every lever at our disposal as we always do to make the best decisions for the business. Good morning. And on your other question, we are constantly looking at a couple things relative to the strength of retail takeaway in other CPG categories, as well as our own. And also how much market share is going to private label as that has typically also been a predictor of the consumer. We're fortunate in our category, not to have significant private label, but certainly in other categories where that's present we do look at that as well. Good morning. Boy, I'd say, my first answer to that question is the resources to sustain and grow are in supply chain building capacity to really be able to drive against the very strong demand. So probably first and foremost, I think that's the focus. I believe we have the retail resources that we need from a sales perspective. Our sales organization, from a marketing capability, I wouldn't say it's maybe as much about people we've continued to invest in capability with a new media partner, better targeting capabilities. Certainly that helps us to really maximize consumer demand and then maintaining the strong relationships that we have with retailers and just continue to evolve the total bundle of investment we have to drive against demand with our retailers and our consumers. But right now I think we're focused really on supply chain, hiring more people in manufacturing facilities, engineers to execute the capacity work. That's really where the focus is. Well, clearly as we are executing this capacity and looking at the future, automation, yes is a big lever across the business. We still have opportunities in some of our manufacturing facilities for what we call single point of automation, say an automated case pack or whatever the basic automation is. And then we kind of go to the connectivity of all the different parts of our system, talking to each other. And across our entire business, not just supply chain, we continue to look at opportunities where technology can allow us to operate more efficiently, give us better insights, et cetera. And then certainly as we look at our Salty business, now that we are gaining more scale and have many more businesses in that portfolio. As Steve mentioned earlier, we're doing a lot of work on just optimizing the overall supply chain network and what that looks like. And that's more efficient distribution. It is more efficient manufacturing, really across the board and that's somewhat of a transformation. Yes. Yes. I don't believe we are behind. This is a category where it tends to be line priced. It's really noise related to Easter and just the mix of items that vary across different competitors during the Easter timeframe. I think as we go forward, you'll see that really even out. Okay. So, we are big believers in advertising. I think we've talked a lot about our model is we are pleased to have some of the strongest gross margins in the end of street, and we believe in the model and then using some of those funds to reinvest in our brands and be one of the highest investors in the industry. It's a highly responsive category with a strong impulsive nature as well. As you look to the rest of the year, we believe we will be up mid to high single digits and we will continue to invest as we expand capacity wherever we can because we're big believers. Media efficiencies have really helped us to control the dollar cost because as a result of a new partnership and also new capabilities, we've gotten more efficiencies in our media. I think from a philosophy perspective, relative to your question about digital. We have not seen decline in list and return. And I don't know if that's \u2013 if they're being offset because we've built capabilities, new capabilities to better target. And so we're actually seeing a stronger targeting capability and thus better efficiency."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin.\nMelissa Poole: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's fourth quarter 2023 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the prerecorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session, we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The Company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today\u2019s press release and the Company\u2019s SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning\u2019s press release. Joining me today are Hershey\u2019s Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck and Hershey\u2019s Senior Vice-President and CFO Steve Voskuil. With that I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much good morning everybody.\nMichele Buck: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Maybe to start off your guidance for 2024 calls for that 2% to 3% net sales growth with volume flat to slightly down so implies over a three point year-over-year benefit from price which seems to be mostly carry over related from actions taken last year. So I guess my question is just recurring outlook embed any additional pricing actions this year to address the currently elevated cocoa cost and if not I guess if Hershey were to take additional pricing actions. Would those benefit 2024 or with the typical timing lag and kind of complexity of the system's transition, would that likely really be more of a 2025 benefit at this stage?\nMichele Buck: Hey Andrew, let me talk a little bit about our pricing approach and strategy and then Steve will go into the numbers. It's a dynamic environment out there and we are taking a measured approach given historic inflation. As we can't talk about future pricing, but I do want to be very clear that there's no change to our pricing strategy and our commitment to use pricing to cover inflation and to support the investments that we think are critical to drive the business. So given where Cocoa prices are, we will be using every tool in our toolbox, including pricing as a way to manage the business. Steve, do you want to talk about some more of the specifics?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, the way you laid it out, Andrew, is correct. The pricing that we're counting on that 3% or so, a lot of it's carryover, some of it from 2022 to Easter and Valentine's Day, some we took mid last year on everyday chocolate and then a small increase we announced earlier this year on grocery items and food service. And you're right, when we think about the impact of future price increase, we're really challenged in the first half of this year just because of the ERP implementation, like you said, it puts some limitations on what we can do. And you can imagine enormous collaboration between us and retailers to execute that transformation. So we're trying to keep things very stable during that period. And so further price increases should they come with benefit more the back half of the year and probably more so 2025.\nAndrew Lazar: Got it, thanks for that. And then the EPS in 2024 is expected to be sort of flat for the year. There's obviously a big discrepancy between what you're looking for in the first half versus the second half in terms of EPS growth. I guess, I'm trying to get a sense of how much of this is anticipated improvement in the consumer environment versus what you have maybe more visibility and control over with things such as timing of your plan system spending and timing of cost saves and productivity. Just trying to get a sense of the visibility to that, to the swing, if you will, and EPS growth between the first half and second half. Thanks so much.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure, yes, it's not banking on cocoa relief and it's not banking on some kind of surge in the consumer or really even a surge in the base business. The biggest factor is really two things driving it. One is the lapse from last year. And as we started out really strong the first quarter last year and then ran into things like softer, salty category growth in popcorn, the ERP implementation in salty, and then the change in strategy at a key retailer. So as we think about the lapse of those, that's one factor that impacts this profile because the lapse gets much easier in the back half. And then the second thing you mentioned, Andrew, are things in our control. So the savings on the agility and automation initiative will get more traction in the back half again because the ERP places some limitations there. The same with productivity in the manufacturing areas, back half loaded. And so those will accumulate as we turn the corner from the first half and pivot from the ERP sort of period of stability to period of driving impacts against those savings initiatives. So it's really lapse combined with the things in our control.\nAndrew Lazar: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask a little bit, you have more innovation coming this year, you have more capacity, you're battling an elasticity situation that I think it's fair to say is higher than many people expected, but your media spending is only being increased by the same amount as sales growth. I realize you're focusing on some key items a little bit more and you're kind of rebalancing some of that, but just trying to get a sense of the risk of some of your more flanker type brands if media is pulled away from them, if that's the impression I'm getting, if that's the right one. And how to really to think about your decision to maybe not raise media spending a little bit more than sales growth to kind of make sure that, you're battling elasticity in the way that's appropriate.\nMichele Buck: Yes, thanks Ken. As we are big believers and our business model relies on media as a key lever to continue to drive our brands over the long-term. We're constantly, we feel good about media going up in line with sales. We also constantly look to try and make those dollars work harder and harder for us. And we've made some pivots in terms of some of our targeting that are actually going to give us expanded reach levels that will be greater than sales. So the impact we will get from that media will be more than the dollar increase, but we will constantly evaluate that. And if we are seeing even better than we expected, we'll revisit decisions and decide if we should be spending more as we always do during the year.\nKen Goldman: Thanks. And then quickly, it's not often we see kind of a venerable, established category like popcorn maybe slumping to this degree. Not really thinking about share gains or losses for Hershey in particular, but what do you see happening most recently in popcorn and what do you think needs to happen for the category to rebound?\nMichele Buck: Yes, I mean, I think what we saw this year was we did start to see some pressure in the category related to value. The fact that popcorn wasn't quite have as much satiety as some other snacks and we saw some private label entries also get some focus. So I think what needs to happen and then compounded by that, in the back half of the year, we are the number one or number two player depending on the time frame in the category. And in the back half of the year, around our ERP implementation, we pulled back on merchandising and advertising support to make sure that we didn't have issues with supply. So that certainly had an impact as well. So as we've gone into this year, what we think needs to happen, we have done. So we have made some improvements in the value proposition, introduced a value side, a bigger pack. We've sharpened some of our merchandising price points and also increased merchandising. And we are back to a much heavier investment in advertising and innovation that we've had over time. So we think we'll continue to see some of that lap through the first five months of the year and then really rebound to nice growth and market share gains in the back half.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nMax Gumport: Hi, thanks for the question. With regard to cocoa prices, you've previously talked about how there's a divergence between fundamentals and current market prices. I'm assuming you're looking at underlying supply, demand and the stock to grinding ratio, but I'm curious for an update on that front and how that informs your visibility into cocoa for 2024. Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yes, we look at a variety of things, as you can imagine. I'll say the fundamentals. And when I say look at, we have an internal team of experts in this domain, but we also have outside folks who also give us points of view to make sure we're not myopic in the way we look at the market and what's happening. But we look at the fundamentals, we look at grind data, we look at crop yields, we look at weather, we look at all of those fundamentals and, of course, demand. But at the same time, there's a lot of financial activity, transactional sort of activity and speculation that overlays the fundamentals. And it's been difficult, certainly, to untangle those two pieces. And so, that's part of the reason that we have a hedging program is that, we're not here to try to outsmart the market and beat the speculators per se. We want to make sure that we have visibility and have the opportunity to reduce volatility to the extent we can in the P&L. But it's certainly a very dynamic market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Morning.\nBryan Spillane: Hey, so I've got two questions. And the first one is just, I don't know if it was actually in the press release or not, but Steve, have you given us a sense of just what your overall inflation is or maybe what cocoa inflation is? I've got that question a few times this morning. So what's the inflation rate, I guess, in the guide?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. If you look at it, kind of break it into two pieces, I'll just say commodities of which I'll just say cocoa and sugar are the two most inflationary. Low double digit inflation, if you look at other parts of the P&L, it's more mid-single digit. So if you sort of average it over everything, it's high single digit.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And that's pretty well locked in, right? I'm assuming that, like you've got coverage on commodities for the year. Should we, is that a good expectation?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, that's correct.\nBryan Spillane: Okay, cool. And then, Michelle, just to, I guess, a bigger question or a broader question is just on the cost savings, the incremental savings this morning. Can you talk a little bit about maybe how you came, how as an organization you came to that? And, I think the question that some folks are asking this morning is just, are the cost savings a reaction, right, to inflation? You're trying to preserve as much earnings as you can, which maybe implies cutting too much. You've got a lot of stuff going on, an ERP system transition. Like, is it really burdening the organization too much to try to focus so much on costs when there's so much other stuff going on? So just your perspective on that, I think, would be helpful for folks.\nMichele Buck: Yes, sure. So I would say, a year to 18 months ago, we had started working on some initiatives that we thought could create some real opportunity and value for the company. And executing those was dependent on two things. It was dependent on us getting through the S4 implementation, which we will be through Q2 of this year. And it was also dependent on us doing the unification of our Salty Snacks business, taking those disparate acquisitions we had and combining them together, which obviously we did this past year and also put in place S4 across that platform, across that business unit. That then can become an accelerator for us to really go after what we saw as some opportunities, both in terms of creating greater end-to-end connectivity and also using technology for automation and efficiency. So this is really where we expected that we would be. Certainly with some of the pressure on coca prices, we accelerated that work a bit versus our original timeline, but the work was planned and underway accordingly. And we're trying to be very choiceful about where are the choices that we are making across those initiatives, and certainly making sure that a lot of that implementation won't happen till post S4, till we get through the implementation. So really measuring out when we do what to match with the organizational capacity. Steve, anything you would add to that?\nSteve Voskuil: No, we're excited. We're going to get through ERP. We'll have 95% of our business all on one platform and the opportunities that will unlock. And then as Michelle said, thinking ahead to things like integrated demand planning and bringing more automation to supply chain. These were things we had in the vision before, but now we're much closer to being able to make them realized.\nBryan Spillane: Steve, you may be the first person that use excited in ERP in the same sentence.\nSteve Voskuil: Oh, you might. I look forward to seeing you guys in Florida.\nBryan Spillane: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Can I ask about honing in on the chocolate category in the U.S? You've obviously seen some nice recovery in volume and market share over the last two or three months. It's been fairly sharp. Can you talk about what the main drivers of that are? I imagine that innovation with the Reese's Caramels launch might be a piece of that. Just giving us some idea of what's driving that and whether that trend is expected to continue.\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. I'd say there are two things that have really created some nice momentum on the business. One was we saw consumers have a huge affinity to the seasonal traditions. And we had very strong growth in the category in both Halloween and holiday. And we also won share. So that was certainly a key driver. And as you mentioned, we had talked about earlier this year, the opportunity for us in 2024 to really dial up innovation. We had a later year in 2023. Our innovation for 2024 is up about a third versus where it was in 2023. And we're really excited that we have some big innovations. Reese's Caramel, we believe will be a very nice addition. And that's doing well in Q4, continues to. We'll be featured on the Super Bowl. So you can look for that as well. And then we have some exciting sweets innovation later in the year.\nAlexia Howard: Perfect. And just continuing on the theme of innovation, you mentioned a third increase. Are you able to quantify where you're at in terms of percentage of sales from new products introduced over the last three years? I imagine that that would have come down significantly since the pandemic started.\nMichele Buck: Yes, so we are up about 35% higher in terms of innovation versus prior year. And we are up slightly versus pre-pandemic as well. I think we've chosen not to talk about innovation as a percent of net sales.\nAlexia Howard: Okay, perfect. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi, good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nPamela Kaufman: A question on your capacity expansion plans. I think you previously mentioned you had a 15% increase in capacity coming online this year. Can you just give an update on that? And do your cost savings initiatives impact these plans at all? And then maybe you can remind us what products the capacity is going to be used for.\nMichele Buck: So I'll cover some of that and let Steve cover some of it. We've continued to invest in capacity in brands and businesses across the portfolio that have growth and opportunity ahead. Over the past couple of years, we've focused on Reese\u2019s where we were short on capacity so that we could fulfill consumer demand. And then the other big area of focus we had was on the gummy side of the business in suites. And the first part of this year, we complete and have capacity coming online for that business that we will be able to leverage to better participate in that segment in the back half of the year. Steve?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, the only thing I would add is everything is on track. Yes, we're proceeding per plan and the cost savings project that we talked about doesn't have any direct impact on those plans other than as we look to the future, more opportunities to automate and create some agility and supply chain beyond those projects, so.\nPamela Kaufman: Great, thank you. And in the prepared remarks, you pointed to 200 basis points of gross margin contraction this year. Can you walk us through how you're thinking about the puts and takes around gross margins in 2024? And if you could give some color on the cadence of gross margin progression this year.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure, yes, I'll give a highlight that the prepared remarks actually have a good section on that. So whatever I missed here, refer back to that. But with overall full year basis down 200 basis points, as you said, we're going to see more of that in the first half than the second half for some of the reasons we talked about even earlier in this Q&A session. We will have in the second half higher commodity inflation, but in the second half, we'll begin to see more benefits from continuous improvements, so manufacturing cost savings, the agility and automation program that we talked about will kick into more gear in the second half as we get past the ERP process. And then we're lapping some one-time costs in the back half related to Salty and the ERP program. So those laps plus the accumulated benefits that pick up on the savings side are what drive the biggest inflection from a gross margin standpoint as we look at the second half having less drag than the first half.\nPamela Kaufman: Okay, thank you. And just one more quick question. How are you thinking about the outlook for cocoa prices from here? And how is that influencing your hedging strategy?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, our hedging strategy has not changed. Our kind of principles around how we manage commodities hasn't changed. It's a dynamic market, and we're not going to comment too much about future pricing. Our business, as Michelle said, we've seen cycles like this before. We've got a lot of tools at our disposal to manage the impact of cocoa, and we plan to use all of those, so.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. I guess I have two questions. The first is market share assumptions in the U.S. for 2024. Is it fair to say that you think you can grow share in confectionery? And the second thing, on the pricing strategy, Michelle, nothing's changed, but this is a different strategy than what you've had in the past. The idea is to kind of squeeze out the pricing in maybe more frequently and in smaller increments. And I guess, is that still possible to do in an environment like this when the input costs spike so significantly? It sounds like that, it sounds like you're doing it this year, but, is it more difficult to execute when you see this much volatility in the inputs or not?\nMichele Buck: Okay. So I'll take the first question, first relative to market share. We expect to see sequential improvement as we go throughout the year. The first half will be pressured by a shorter Easter. Easter comes much earlier this year. And also we will have about five, roughly five months in the first half of lapping the reduced merchandising and distribution at that one key retailer. And we know from this past year, the impact of that was about two points in total. We offset about one point of that on a takeaway basis. So that will pressure share. In the second half, we then are past those laps of the shorter Easter and the retail merch. And so we expect to see sequential improvement and to end the year in a much better place than where we're starting. As I think about our pricing strategy, I'd say what is consistent is our goal to cover inflation with price over time. Within that, how exactly we do that relative to smaller, shorter, more frequent, or bigger, the timing and the magnitude, to me are heavily influenced by other factors, such as where our input costs and general inflation are. So I think, yes, that the overall, we have a strategy to expand growth margins to price to cover inflation and allow reinvestment. That hasn't changed, but how we go about doing that will be a bit different. We're also very much focused, price pack architecture is an opportunity, all the tools in the lever.\nRobert Moskow: Got it, so you can be flexible depending on the cost conditions.\nMichele Buck: Yes. Okay, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you, good morning. I just wanted to come back to Easter and the ERP transition. You'd mentioned with Salty in 4Q, how you cut back on some of the merchandising and even I think a little bit of the marketing spend. You mentioned Easter being a little bit shorter, but is there sort of an amplified headwind from the timing that, would you be doing a similar approach to promotions or marketing in conjunction with the transition to dial that back a little bit? Or is there a reason that they wouldn't apply the same way as the Salty transition did?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, we're not applying the same approach we did with Salty in that respect. We'll still be building inventory in the first quarter, we'll still be draining that inventory in the second quarter just to de-risk the transition, but we are not going the extra step of like freezing from all activity in store, merchandising promotion. We have a full merchandising and promotion plan. Those are going to proceed, they were planned well in advance and we have full confidence in being able to support them. So that is a difference.\nMichele Buck: Yes, we felt like we got really good learning through the Salty and this was our plan to do Mexico first, then Salty and then the mother ship. And we got really good learning that we've been able to just incorporate and fine tune along the way. We also don't have the complexity as quite as many different systems that we have to bring together with our business as we did with all of the acquisitions.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, that's great color. And then can you just give us a sense on elasticities maybe both how they currently look versus history and then also what your assumptions are in the guidance as far as how they might progress over the rest of the year?\nMichele Buck: Yes, so we're expecting our elasticities to be similar to the historic levels. So that's our key assumption.\nMichael Lavery: Okay, great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Palmer with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Palmer: Good morning. Thanks for the questions. Maybe just first-off on the pull forward of the productivity and cost savings, I just wanted to follow up from the earlier question. Are there new found savings embedded in this or are these largely initiatives that would have been done in future years? Just maybe clarify that piece of it.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure, so when we did our investor conference back in March, we talked about incremental productivity savings in the manufacturing area. So this is incremental to that to start with. This is beyond that. As Michelle said, in the longer term view, we saw these as opportunities, but it's new opportunities really built off the back of some of the technology now coming to fruition is the way to think about it.\nMichele Buck: And we've really beefed up or are beefing up our capabilities in technology. We hired a CDTO in the fourth quarter who's really bringing us capability and further expanding what we can do as a company, we believe.\nTom Palmer: Okay, thank you. And I know there's some questions that kind of danced around this, but maybe I'll be a little more direct on it. Just on pricing, what exactly is flowing through as we think about 2024? So kind of what pieces of the portfolio are being touched? Are there incremental pricing actions embedded at all in guidance or kind of what we start out in the first quarter is the run rate is kind of the full magnitude?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure, yes. So we have sort of three pricing components that are embedded into the Outlook. I touched on a couple of these earlier. There's the Easter Valentine's Day action that was taken in 2022, that's reflected this year. There's everyday chocolate increase that we executed mid last year, that's reflected. And then there's a small new price increase on some grocery and food service items that really went just into effect this month. So that's happening right now. Those are the only assumptions that are embedded in the outlook right now.\nTom Palmer: Right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So just a few follow-ups, if I could. Just on gross margin, again, just kind of put a fine point on this one. Do you expect expansion in the back half of the year, or are you saying that it's just going to be less contraction in the front half?\nSteve Voskuil: It's going to be less contraction. Yes, the contraction will be more significant in the first half, less in the back half.\nChris Carey: Okay, understood. That's what I thought. Thanks. And then just on a segment basis, right, there's this dynamic where most of the inflation clearly is hitting you on the confection side, but probably some of the more fundamental category dynamics are more pressured on the snack side, clearly, because you're expecting low algorithm for next year. And so just from a margin dynamic between the segments themselves, is there a dynamic where \u2013 and this quarter is so hard to assess with snacks because of the \u2013 because of the RP \u2013 but will snacks require more investment in a strange way? It'll have more margin contraction than what we're going to see in confection. Is there any way you can just kind of frame investment needs and sort of fundamental margin pressure in snacks versus just, I guess, inflationary driven \u2013 inflation that we would see in confection? And then I apologize for just one more cleanup in a way. But I think to Brian's question on SM&A as a percentage of sales, we're probably implying a roughly 15-year low for this year. Maybe just help us contextualize why we're not getting too low from that standpoint. And maybe that 15-year journey is just about increasing efficiency relative to sales base. It's come up a couple times. So any added context there would maybe be helpful. Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. On the segment margins, you're right. The confection business is going to bear the brunt of the margin impact due to cocoa. Salty margins are up for 2024 year-over-year. And that's even on the back of some pretty heavy investment. And so we feel good about the journey that we're on there. It's not impacted, obviously, by the cocoa component. On the second question, could you just say the question again? I want to make sure I heard that one.\nChris Carey: It's effectively that operating costs as a percentage of sales look to be implied at a roughly 15-year low in 2024. And it's really just understanding why that's not cutting to the bone or going too low relative well, we're just getting more efficient relative to sales base over time. And that's what we're doing next year and the year after. So maybe just contextualizing that history would be helpful in putting 2024 in context. Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yes. Well, let me first say we're not cutting to the bone. That's not the intent of the program at all. We want to continue to protect the brands and the capabilities that give us differentiated opportunities in market. When you look at operating expenses, if you look back over time, definitely getting more fixed cost leverage, the business is bigger. Even with a little bit slower growth year in 2024 than we've seen the last couple of years, we get significant leverage. We have efficiencies elsewhere in the P&L, efficient driving efficiencies through the P&L is an every year activity. And that's not new. And we've also seen more efficiencies in the international business. If you think back, the margins were quite a bit lower a couple of years ago before we made some of the transformational moves there. So a combination of all of those things have led to the improvements that we're seeing, but we're not cutting so far that we feel we're putting in jeopardy any of our key capabilities or growth potential.\nChris Carey: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. Michelle, I just wanted to come back to your, I guess, brief commentary today. And I think you've mentioned it on the prior couple of calls just around consumer shopping for products with maybe a bit more satiation. Because, clearly the conversation today seems a little bit more focused on cocoa for cost inflation, salty, and then also pricing potential from here. But like if we just separate all that out and we just, focus more on kind of current consumer shopping behavior, especially within the confection category. Would you say, there are kind of ongoing behavioral shifts that are still taking place or you kind of foresee that, maybe reversing out as you get through the year or just trying to get a sense as to kind of how you view the consumer shopping that category relative to other parts of snacks? Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Yes, I mean, I'd say first of all, overall with the consumer, certainly I think there is some increase in consumer confidence. We've seen unemployment rates, employment be stable. However, we do continue to see some value-seeking behavior in some pockets of consumers. We believe that the behavior across confection has largely normalized and we think that we have some of the right steps in place to kind of offset that satiety issue that we've seen with popcorn in areas like adjusting value across different pack types, enhancing marketing communication in ways that, build the value proposition. So we do expect that we'll start to see some normalization in popcorn as we go through the year.\nRob Dickerson: Okay, got it. And then I guess I just want to ask on kind of longer-term salty segment growth potential. While I realize you may not be giving, providing new long-term targets relative to what you presented at the Investor Day last year, I mean, clearly it seems like, enough has changed, let's say, to at least ask the question. So if we're thinking kind of past 2024, like do you think broadly that kind of low double-digit kind of growth for that segment is still feasible or like, could distribution maybe be a little slower? There needs to be a little bit more investment required to get there. Just kind of any color as to how you're thinking about that. That's it. Thanks so much.\nMichele Buck: Yes, no problem. We continue to feel great about the salty snack business and their long-term potential. We've seen such tremendous growth over time. There's no change to our long-term outlook. Our long-term outlook and the algorithm has always been around mid-single-digit growth. We had never expected low double-digit on the long-term. We had expected originally that this year might be a bit stronger but not on a long-term basis. So no change to that long-term outlook.\nRob Dickerson: Okay, super. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your questions.\nJim Salera: Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing us in. In your prepared comments, you mentioned that we would be seeing some joint merchandising activations between confection and salty. Can you just give us a sense for -- is that to increase, buy rates in Hershey households that maybe buy the confection part of your portfolio but not salty? Or is it more of a way to increase the visibility for salty by kind of piggybacking on, the good merchandising activations you already have for confectionary?\nMichele Buck: Yes, it's really some of both. Certainly there's power to that visibility of all of these great brands together. Our salty brands now are two of our top ten brands. So they have the velocity that warrant being with some of our other really major brands. And then of course it does encourage some of that cross household purchase as well.\nJim Salera: And then if I can maybe drill down on Dot\u2019s in particular, I think you mentioned, incremental club distribution for Dot\u2019s. I can say in my neck of the woods at least, it certainly feels like I or Dot\u2019s placements when I shop my local club store. How much more distribution upside should we think about for Dots in some of those untracked channels where we don't have as much visibility?\nMichele Buck: We still do have some distribution upside on Dot's. So I'd say more than several points of distribution upside still remain.\nJim Salera: Okay. Great, thanks guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning. Thanks for the question. I wanted to come back, Michele, to the outlook for ad spending in 2024, I guess, more or less in line with sales. Is that a function of just having spent ahead of sales in 2023 and now it's a more normalized year? Or is there an expectation for maybe a shift in reinvestment to other drivers, whether it's trade or anything else where your total spend growth is actually above the rate of sales because it just seems as though the larger innovation coming through the need for more pricing in the market. I'm sort of surprised that the ad spend is not going to be up higher this year.\nMichele Buck: We always really do look across the entire bundle. And certainly, we have some trade spending increases in 2024. And so we look at what's the right bundle across DME, across marketing, consumer marketing and trade that we think will have the biggest impact and most efficiently on driving revenue. So it is some of balancing the total view of all of that spending together, which is a big area of focus for us. How do we make it all together work as hard as each individual piece.\nJohn Baumgartner: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the floor back to Ms. Poole for any final comments.\nMelissa Poole: Thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to catching up with you later today to answer any additional questions you may have. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Steve Voskuil",
            "content": "Yes, the way you laid it out, Andrew, is correct. The pricing that we're counting on that 3% or so, a lot of it's carryover, some of it from 2022 to Easter and Valentine's Day, some we took mid last year on everyday chocolate and then a small increase we announced earlier this year on grocery items and food service. And you're right, when we think about the impact of future price increase, we're really challenged in the first half of this year just because of the ERP implementation, like you said, it puts some limitations on what we can do. And you can imagine enormous collaboration between us and retailers to execute that transformation. So we're trying to keep things very stable during that period. And so further price increases should they come with benefit more the back half of the year and probably more so 2025. Sure, yes, it's not banking on cocoa relief and it's not banking on some kind of surge in the consumer or really even a surge in the base business. The biggest factor is really two things driving it. One is the lapse from last year. And as we started out really strong the first quarter last year and then ran into things like softer, salty category growth in popcorn, the ERP implementation in salty, and then the change in strategy at a key retailer. So as we think about the lapse of those, that's one factor that impacts this profile because the lapse gets much easier in the back half. And then the second thing you mentioned, Andrew, are things in our control. So the savings on the agility and automation initiative will get more traction in the back half again because the ERP places some limitations there. The same with productivity in the manufacturing areas, back half loaded. And so those will accumulate as we turn the corner from the first half and pivot from the ERP sort of period of stability to period of driving impacts against those savings initiatives. So it's really lapse combined with the things in our control. Sure. Yes, we look at a variety of things, as you can imagine. I'll say the fundamentals. And when I say look at, we have an internal team of experts in this domain, but we also have outside folks who also give us points of view to make sure we're not myopic in the way we look at the market and what's happening. But we look at the fundamentals, we look at grind data, we look at crop yields, we look at weather, we look at all of those fundamentals and, of course, demand. But at the same time, there's a lot of financial activity, transactional sort of activity and speculation that overlays the fundamentals. And it's been difficult, certainly, to untangle those two pieces. And so, that's part of the reason that we have a hedging program is that, we're not here to try to outsmart the market and beat the speculators per se. We want to make sure that we have visibility and have the opportunity to reduce volatility to the extent we can in the P&L. But it's certainly a very dynamic market. Sure. If you look at it, kind of break it into two pieces, I'll just say commodities of which I'll just say cocoa and sugar are the two most inflationary. Low double digit inflation, if you look at other parts of the P&L, it's more mid-single digit. So if you sort of average it over everything, it's high single digit. Yes, that's correct. No, we're excited. We're going to get through ERP. We'll have 95% of our business all on one platform and the opportunities that will unlock. And then as Michelle said, thinking ahead to things like integrated demand planning and bringing more automation to supply chain. These were things we had in the vision before, but now we're much closer to being able to make them realized. Oh, you might. I look forward to seeing you guys in Florida. Yes, the only thing I would add is everything is on track. Yes, we're proceeding per plan and the cost savings project that we talked about doesn't have any direct impact on those plans other than as we look to the future, more opportunities to automate and create some agility and supply chain beyond those projects, so. Sure, yes, I'll give a highlight that the prepared remarks actually have a good section on that. So whatever I missed here, refer back to that. But with overall full year basis down 200 basis points, as you said, we're going to see more of that in the first half than the second half for some of the reasons we talked about even earlier in this Q&A session. We will have in the second half higher commodity inflation, but in the second half, we'll begin to see more benefits from continuous improvements, so manufacturing cost savings, the agility and automation program that we talked about will kick into more gear in the second half as we get past the ERP process. And then we're lapping some one-time costs in the back half related to Salty and the ERP program. So those laps plus the accumulated benefits that pick up on the savings side are what drive the biggest inflection from a gross margin standpoint as we look at the second half having less drag than the first half. Yes, our hedging strategy has not changed. Our kind of principles around how we manage commodities hasn't changed. It's a dynamic market, and we're not going to comment too much about future pricing. Our business, as Michelle said, we've seen cycles like this before. We've got a lot of tools at our disposal to manage the impact of cocoa, and we plan to use all of those, so. Yes, we're not applying the same approach we did with Salty in that respect. We'll still be building inventory in the first quarter, we'll still be draining that inventory in the second quarter just to de-risk the transition, but we are not going the extra step of like freezing from all activity in store, merchandising promotion. We have a full merchandising and promotion plan. Those are going to proceed, they were planned well in advance and we have full confidence in being able to support them. So that is a difference. Sure, so when we did our investor conference back in March, we talked about incremental productivity savings in the manufacturing area. So this is incremental to that to start with. This is beyond that. As Michelle said, in the longer term view, we saw these as opportunities, but it's new opportunities really built off the back of some of the technology now coming to fruition is the way to think about it. Sure, yes. So we have sort of three pricing components that are embedded into the Outlook. I touched on a couple of these earlier. There's the Easter Valentine's Day action that was taken in 2022, that's reflected this year. There's everyday chocolate increase that we executed mid last year, that's reflected. And then there's a small new price increase on some grocery and food service items that really went just into effect this month. So that's happening right now. Those are the only assumptions that are embedded in the outlook right now. It's going to be less contraction. Yes, the contraction will be more significant in the first half, less in the back half. Sure. On the segment margins, you're right. The confection business is going to bear the brunt of the margin impact due to cocoa. Salty margins are up for 2024 year-over-year. And that's even on the back of some pretty heavy investment. And so we feel good about the journey that we're on there. It's not impacted, obviously, by the cocoa component. On the second question, could you just say the question again? I want to make sure I heard that one. Sure. Yes. Well, let me first say we're not cutting to the bone. That's not the intent of the program at all. We want to continue to protect the brands and the capabilities that give us differentiated opportunities in market. When you look at operating expenses, if you look back over time, definitely getting more fixed cost leverage, the business is bigger. Even with a little bit slower growth year in 2024 than we've seen the last couple of years, we get significant leverage. We have efficiencies elsewhere in the P&L, efficient driving efficiencies through the P&L is an every year activity. And that's not new. And we've also seen more efficiencies in the international business. If you think back, the margins were quite a bit lower a couple of years ago before we made some of the transformational moves there. So a combination of all of those things have led to the improvements that we're seeing, but we're not cutting so far that we feel we're putting in jeopardy any of our key capabilities or growth potential."

            "content": "Good morning, Andrew. Hey Andrew, let me talk a little bit about our pricing approach and strategy and then Steve will go into the numbers. It's a dynamic environment out there and we are taking a measured approach given historic inflation. As we can't talk about future pricing, but I do want to be very clear that there's no change to our pricing strategy and our commitment to use pricing to cover inflation and to support the investments that we think are critical to drive the business. So given where Cocoa prices are, we will be using every tool in our toolbox, including pricing as a way to manage the business. Steve, do you want to talk about some more of the specifics? Yes, thanks Ken. As we are big believers and our business model relies on media as a key lever to continue to drive our brands over the long-term. We're constantly, we feel good about media going up in line with sales. We also constantly look to try and make those dollars work harder and harder for us. And we've made some pivots in terms of some of our targeting that are actually going to give us expanded reach levels that will be greater than sales. So the impact we will get from that media will be more than the dollar increase, but we will constantly evaluate that. And if we are seeing even better than we expected, we'll revisit decisions and decide if we should be spending more as we always do during the year. Yes, I mean, I think what we saw this year was we did start to see some pressure in the category related to value. The fact that popcorn wasn't quite have as much satiety as some other snacks and we saw some private label entries also get some focus. So I think what needs to happen and then compounded by that, in the back half of the year, we are the number one or number two player depending on the time frame in the category. And in the back half of the year, around our ERP implementation, we pulled back on merchandising and advertising support to make sure that we didn't have issues with supply. So that certainly had an impact as well. So as we've gone into this year, what we think needs to happen, we have done. So we have made some improvements in the value proposition, introduced a value side, a bigger pack. We've sharpened some of our merchandising price points and also increased merchandising. And we are back to a much heavier investment in advertising and innovation that we've had over time. So we think we'll continue to see some of that lap through the first five months of the year and then really rebound to nice growth and market share gains in the back half. Morning. Yes, sure. So I would say, a year to 18 months ago, we had started working on some initiatives that we thought could create some real opportunity and value for the company. And executing those was dependent on two things. It was dependent on us getting through the S4 implementation, which we will be through Q2 of this year. And it was also dependent on us doing the unification of our Salty Snacks business, taking those disparate acquisitions we had and combining them together, which obviously we did this past year and also put in place S4 across that platform, across that business unit. That then can become an accelerator for us to really go after what we saw as some opportunities, both in terms of creating greater end-to-end connectivity and also using technology for automation and efficiency. So this is really where we expected that we would be. Certainly with some of the pressure on coca prices, we accelerated that work a bit versus our original timeline, but the work was planned and underway accordingly. And we're trying to be very choiceful about where are the choices that we are making across those initiatives, and certainly making sure that a lot of that implementation won't happen till post S4, till we get through the implementation. So really measuring out when we do what to match with the organizational capacity. Steve, anything you would add to that? Good morning. Yes, absolutely. I'd say there are two things that have really created some nice momentum on the business. One was we saw consumers have a huge affinity to the seasonal traditions. And we had very strong growth in the category in both Halloween and holiday. And we also won share. So that was certainly a key driver. And as you mentioned, we had talked about earlier this year, the opportunity for us in 2024 to really dial up innovation. We had a later year in 2023. Our innovation for 2024 is up about a third versus where it was in 2023. And we're really excited that we have some big innovations. Reese's Caramel, we believe will be a very nice addition. And that's doing well in Q4, continues to. We'll be featured on the Super Bowl. So you can look for that as well. And then we have some exciting sweets innovation later in the year. Yes, so we are up about 35% higher in terms of innovation versus prior year. And we are up slightly versus pre-pandemic as well. I think we've chosen not to talk about innovation as a percent of net sales. Thanks. Good morning. So I'll cover some of that and let Steve cover some of it. We've continued to invest in capacity in brands and businesses across the portfolio that have growth and opportunity ahead. Over the past couple of years, we've focused on Reese's where we were short on capacity so that we could fulfill consumer demand. And then the other big area of focus we had was on the gummy side of the business in suites. And the first part of this year, we complete and have capacity coming online for that business that we will be able to leverage to better participate in that segment in the back half of the year. Steve? Okay. So I'll take the first question, first relative to market share. We expect to see sequential improvement as we go throughout the year. The first half will be pressured by a shorter Easter. Easter comes much earlier this year. And also we will have about five, roughly five months in the first half of lapping the reduced merchandising and distribution at that one key retailer. And we know from this past year, the impact of that was about two points in total. We offset about one point of that on a takeaway basis. So that will pressure share. In the second half, we then are past those laps of the shorter Easter and the retail merch. And so we expect to see sequential improvement and to end the year in a much better place than where we're starting. As I think about our pricing strategy, I'd say what is consistent is our goal to cover inflation with price over time. Within that, how exactly we do that relative to smaller, shorter, more frequent, or bigger, the timing and the magnitude, to me are heavily influenced by other factors, such as where our input costs and general inflation are. So I think, yes, that the overall, we have a strategy to expand growth margins to price to cover inflation and allow reinvestment. That hasn't changed, but how we go about doing that will be a bit different. We're also very much focused, price pack architecture is an opportunity, all the tools in the lever. Yes. Okay, thank you so much. Yes, we felt like we got really good learning through the Salty and this was our plan to do Mexico first, then Salty and then the mother ship. And we got really good learning that we've been able to just incorporate and fine tune along the way. We also don't have the complexity as quite as many different systems that we have to bring together with our business as we did with all of the acquisitions. Yes, so we're expecting our elasticities to be similar to the historic levels. So that's our key assumption. And we've really beefed up or are beefing up our capabilities in technology. We hired a CDTO in the fourth quarter who's really bringing us capability and further expanding what we can do as a company, we believe. Yes, I mean, I'd say first of all, overall with the consumer, certainly I think there is some increase in consumer confidence. We've seen unemployment rates, employment be stable. However, we do continue to see some value-seeking behavior in some pockets of consumers. We believe that the behavior across confection has largely normalized and we think that we have some of the right steps in place to kind of offset that satiety issue that we've seen with popcorn in areas like adjusting value across different pack types, enhancing marketing communication in ways that, build the value proposition. So we do expect that we'll start to see some normalization in popcorn as we go through the year. Yes, no problem. We continue to feel great about the salty snack business and their long-term potential. We've seen such tremendous growth over time. There's no change to our long-term outlook. Our long-term outlook and the algorithm has always been around mid-single-digit growth. We had never expected low double-digit on the long-term. We had expected originally that this year might be a bit stronger but not on a long-term basis. So no change to that long-term outlook. Yes, it's really some of both. Certainly there's power to that visibility of all of these great brands together. Our salty brands now are two of our top ten brands. So they have the velocity that warrant being with some of our other really major brands. And then of course it does encourage some of that cross household purchase as well. We still do have some distribution upside on Dot's. So I'd say more than several points of distribution upside still remain. We always really do look across the entire bundle. And certainly, we have some trade spending increases in 2024. And so we look at what's the right bundle across DME, across marketing, consumer marketing and trade that we think will have the biggest impact and most efficiently on driving revenue. So it is some of balancing the total view of all of that spending together, which is a big area of focus for us. How do we make it all together work as hard as each individual piece."

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin.\nMelissa Poole: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's third quarter 2023 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the prerecorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session, we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors, the presentation that this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning, everybody.\nMichele Buck: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks. At Hershey's Analyst Day earlier this year, I know that the company expressed confidence in sort of generating the high end of its sort of long-term growth algorithm for 2024. And we know some things have changed since then. There's been some more inflation. You talk about what seems to be the need for maybe some more aggressive investment spend behind stepped-up innovation as well as some shifting between trade and consumer spend and some consumer behavior shifts. So I was hoping maybe you could take us through, I guess, some of the key puts and takes for next year, how you're seeing all of this rolling up at this point? And basically, if 2024 can still be sort of an on-algorithm year even if not necessarily at the high end.\nMichele Buck: Sure. So certainly, Andrew, we recognize that the world continues to be very dynamic out there, but we think we're very confident that we can pivot and adjust to those changes. If we think about things that we're anticipating strength on from a top line perspective, we've got good visibility with the capacity enabled growth, the capacity that will come online. Gummies in particular, is an area where we've not been able to fully take advantage of the growth in the Sweet segment. We're going to be in a much better position next year to do that. Certainly, some of the capacity that came online this year has been helpful to us relative to seasons and better being able to take full advantage in that area. That will be a benefit next year as well as additional Reese. Certainly, we have higher levels of innovation. Reese's' Caramel is one that we have highlighted already, but that's going to be very helpful for us in terms of driving the overall business as well as merch. We have some opportunities in distribution on salty Dot's in particular. And of course, we also have pricing carryover from this year. From a margin perspective, we know that we've got inflation that's a bit of a headwind with all-time high commodity costs in cocoa. But we also have pricing and productivity that will help to offset that. It will have some one-time pressures related to the S/4 transition. But again, that's really a transient event and will create some issues relative to inventory in the first part of the year. So that's kind of a little bit of an overview. Steve, anything you would add to that?\nSteve Voskuil: No. I think you hit all the key pieces. Obviously, the next time we talk, we'll have a lot more details on next year. So\u2026\nAndrew Lazar: Yes. Great. And maybe just as a follow-up, you mentioned pricing and productivity. We know that there's already some pricing that will flow through and benefit 2024 from initiatives you've already announced and sort of put into the market. Have there been any other incremental pricing actions announced or that you think there'll be potentially the need for given where some of the cost increases are coming from?\nMichele Buck: We have not announced any incremental price increases. We always evaluate the marketplace and have a lot of factors that we consider to determine how to best grow the business. Pricing is certainly one tool. I mentioned productivity. Now that we're in a better shape from a capacity perspective, we have more ability in our supply chain to activate productivity, and then we also look at productivity across every line item of the P&L, whether its trade, media, organizational processes and make sure we're really leveraging the best capabilities and investments to drive the business.\nAndrew Lazar: Okay. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on Andrew's question a little bit about next year. I very much understand you're not necessarily in a position yet to discuss all the details of 2024, but you have given us some sales outlook and EPS outlook for next year. And I guess the question was whether you can hit the high-end of algo or the numbers that you put out there, and I realize things are still changing and pivoting. But I'm just really curious, because I think it's an important question to kind of follow-up on that guidance that you had given and really get a better understanding of how the incremental headwinds that have come since your Investor Day? I guess it's been a little more powerful than some of the tailwinds that have come as well. I'm just trying to get a sense of kind of balancing all that, I think, a little bit in the context of the fact that some numbers have been provided already. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yes, I'm happy to take it. It is an important question, and we'll address it a lot more fully on the next call. I think, the key right now is there are a lot of moving pieces even since we had that call, and some things are progressing in a positive way. We talked about productivity a little bit already. Productivity was one of the upsides we talked about on the call, we're having a great year from a productivity standpoint, and I expect that to carry forward. As Michele just said, we'll continue to look at pricing in all variables, pack price architecture, regular pricing and other places for productivity. And then we're watching the commodity markets closely. And there's been a pretty significant change there, too, from the beginning of the year. And so as we get together next time, we'll be able to pull all of that together and give you a better picture on how we feel about what we said back at the investor conference. But right now, we're still looking at, as Michele said, a pretty dynamic environment.\nKen Goldman: Okay. Thank you for that. And then my follow-up is, as we think about the trade de-load, you mentioned with the key retailer. Can you talk a little bit about what drove that and what some of the risks are that additional de-loads happen with maybe some of your other customers?\nMichele Buck: Yes. And really, what we saw from the key retailer was a reduction in merchandising, which did pull back on shipments into that retailer. And this is really about their strategy to improve the shopping experience for their consumers and also to make fulfilling online orders easier for their pickers in store. This was a change that impacted many categories. Confection was one of those, and we had a disproportionate impact because we have had a very high share of merchandising. And therefore, that pullback impacted us, but it impacted many other categories in both edibles and nonedible.  Now this, I want to point out, this is really related to every day. So as you think about Q4 and the importance of Halloween and Holiday this did not impact season. So we don't expect the same impact in Q4 given how much of our business is seasonal. We do think that this will be a headwind in the first part of 2024, where we're lapping higher levels of March.\nKen Goldman: Thank you for the clarification. I appreciate it.\nMichele Buck: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. \nMax Gumport: Hi, thanks for the question. First, I just wanted to follow up on your commentary on the retailer merchandising reduction. It sounded like it was to help improve the shopping experience and the e-commerce and picking ability as well. Is there any reason to think other retailers could follow the same path? It sounds like it's just one key retailer for now. But are there any reasons to expect other retailers will follow?\nMichele Buck: I don't anticipate that. I think this retailer, the degree of merchandising at this retailer was much greater than at many others. So I wouldn't anticipate that.\nMax Gumport: Great. And then on Halloween, it sounds like it's up slightly so far. I know there was a low double-digit expectation. And I know that this year, shopping patterns have been a bit more normal, so less shopping earlier in the year. So I think that would be one key reason to think you can still get to that low double-digit number, but I just wanted to make sure you still have visibility to low double target for Halloween this year. Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yes I think the way you characterized it is certainly correct. We have seen a normalization of patterns from consumers in terms of when they're shopping as their concerns about potential availability are not there this year like they were last year. 50% of the season does sell through in the last two weeks of October. So we still do have a bit of product to sell through. And with Halloween falling on a Tuesday, there will be a lot of sales this weekend. We have seen a little bit of softness in the season from some cohorts that have indicated affordability was a concern in their participation and it wasn\u2019t just candy it was some other seasonal categories including decoration, costumes et cetera. But we are out there building aggressive displays, the product is out there and we are continuing to drive to deliver our expectation for the season\nMax Gumport: Thanks very much. I\u2019ll leave it there.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. \nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: Just I was wondering if you could catch us up on Cocoa. Obviously, we see the market rates or the spot rates. But you've always done, I think it's anything from three to 18 or maybe even more months of hedging and contracting. And, can you just give us a sense of maybe what, if anything, you expect the market to do, how you're positioned relative to that? I know the pricing question came up a little bit earlier and you haven't announced anything, but is there any reason to believe that you would have any different approach than normal where if it remains an elevated source of pressure, you could take the pricing to cover it? Just some thoughts on how all that looks from your seat?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure, I'd be happy to do that. On the Cocoa side, our policies haven't changed. You reference the hedging horizon and those fundamentals haven't changed. I would say as we sit here today, we probably have less visibility on a full year 2024 pricing locked in that we might have had in prior years. And some of that is driven by the high pricing right now. But we're staying very close to the market and of course that influences other parts of the strategy as you mentioned like pricing. From the pricing standpoint, as Michele said, there's also nothing fundamentally has changed there in our strategy. Pricing is one -- tool and there's a lot of ways to deliver pricing and there's productivity and other things in the P&L that also have to be part of that equation. So I would say there's nothing off the table, but as we come back in 2024 and give guidance, we'll be able to give more color. And by then we'll also have another picture on where the cocoa market is headed. We talked a little bit in the last call that there is some divergence between, what we see in pricing and some of the underlying fundamentals. And we still have an aspiration at some point that that will normalize. But to the extent it doesn't, we thought that earlier this year, and it didn't play out that way. But every quarter that goes by, we get more visibility, and that will inform how we think about the pricing question.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great. That's helpful. And just to follow up on buybacks, you mentioned you didn't have any in the quarter. Obviously, the stock has been more attractively valued from a buyback perspective. How do you think about that going forward? Is there, how are you saving for M&A or is buyback something you might ramp back up?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. It is attractively priced. I agree with you. And so as we think about our capital allocation principles, share of purchase always plays role. We are looking at it closely again as we talk next year and how we're going to allocate capital. You can imagine that's going to play a role and we'll continue to watch what's happening on the stock price and other calls for capital. I will say, we're coming off a pretty big year of capital spending this year. It's not going to look like that next year and so that is going to allow some more cash flow to deploy to other uses. So we'll keep that in mind as we think about 2024.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.\nSteve Voskuil: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.\nPamela Kaufman: Hi. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Hi, Pam.\nPamela Kaufman: We've seen consumer demand soften across categories, including for chocolate, as you mentioned in the prepared remarks. You also pointed to your outlook for demand elasticity to continue to return to normalized levels, but historically the chocolate category has exhibited relatively limited demand elasticity. So can you talk about how you're thinking about demand going forward in Q4 and for next year?\nMichele Buck: Sure. So, I would say we're certainly continue to feel good about our category and the price realization potential in our category as we have had over the years. We focused a lot on the value equation, investing in our business and our brands to keep that strong. At the same time, we're also cognizant that, it is a different time today. We know that value and affordability continue to be top of mind for consumers as budgets are stretched, some less government assistance, the restart of student loan repayments, higher interest rates. So we've heard from consumers that they're needing to make difficult choices. So we are certainly focused on that, and making sure that we're really focused on our value equation in terms of selling to value channels, having the right opening price points, et cetera. Food has been more resilient than some other categories but we know that some of the Snap households are reporting that they're eating and buying left. So we're very cognizant of that. And we've also seen some increase in sales in some of the perimeter categories where there's been deflation versus some of the inflationary categories. That said, where we focus on, where are the growth levers that we can continue to drive, to engage consumers and that is having the right levels and the right media targeting approach to continue to keep our brands relevant. But with both the media and the creative, we know that that's important. We didn't have as much innovation this year as we think was ideal on the business, and we've really stepped that up for next year. Feel great about Reese's Caramel in particular, and we'll share some of the other innovation that's coming as we go down the pike. Seasons continues to be a big piece of our business and winning during those seasons, getting that merchandising and it is a time where there's a lot of emotional connectivity with consumers. So it's a natural time for them to come in the category. And we continue to have distribution opportunities, both in terms of some places where we were short on capacity. And we had to pull back on some core items that we're now going to be able to supply as well as some of the innate distribution opportunities that we have on the Salty business. So those are some of the places that we're focused on to really drive growth.\nPamela Kaufman: Thanks. And for my follow-up, just wanted to talk about the competitive dynamics in the Salty Snack segment and within Popcorn, specifically that you highlighted, what do you, what are you observing in the segment? And how are you addressing these competitive pressures?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So I'd start by saying that we have seen some softening in Salty Snacks overall. Volumes held fairly steady throughout the quarter. But growth decelerated as pricing lessened. And there was also some growth that shifted to non-measured channels. Again, we know that affordability and value are of increasing importance to consumers. And we're also seeing them really prioritize some of the more satiating snacks. So as we look at our business, certainly, we're seeing a lot of strength in Pretzels in the category as well as our Dot's distribution opportunities. And as we look at ready-to-eat Popcorn, certainly, we do know that consumers are focused a little bit more on satiety. And we've had some retailers focus on private label and merchandising in particular. As we go into next year, certainly, we'll be focused on productivity in the category. We know that some of the branded items have greater productivity and making sure we're working with retailers on taking full advantage of that continuing to invest in those brands to really grow household penetration and connectivity with consumers. And then certainly, as we look at this year, S4 impacted some of our ability to execute and really lean in as we had to focus on pulling back a bit on support on the business during Q3 and Q4, to enable that build that we needed in inventory and just to make sure that we could move through that very smoothly, and that will be a headwind for us next year.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone. So I guess, I have two questions, and it's kind of more related to, I don't know, the momentum in the business, I guess, and what we should be reading from the fourth quarter in the implied guidance. So I guess two areas if you could touch on them. One is, if we look at the revenue guidance, and I think in the press release, you talked a little bit about in Confection, in North America Confection shipment timing help a little bit. So just if you're thinking about the revenue guidance being held, is that, is what happened in 3Q versus the pull forward or however you want to describe it, is that just purely timing shipment? Or is it a reflection at all that is kind of the softness in every day had an impact as well in terms of the way you're thinking about revenue outlook. So I don't know, is the category or the business kind of slowing more than you thought? And then maybe, Steve, if you can touch on same thing implied margins for the fourth quarter kind of lower in 4Q versus 3Q. So can you just touch on that? And is that somewhat a reflection of the potential for margin degradation? Or again, is this just more timing? So you can kind of touch on those two things, would be helpful. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. We have to do. So I'll start with the sales side. So the biggest driver between Q3 and Q4, and Michele said it before, was seasonal timing. We have a big seasonal timing benefit in Q3 at some at the expense of Q4. Now Q4 also has seasons. We've got Holiday as a big factor and maybe even some early Easter shipments potentially. But Holiday is not as big as Halloween. And so just from a seasonal impact, that's one of the factors. We've kind of modeled historic elasticity. So we saw some of that coming in, in Q3, and we've modeled that more fully into Q4. And, we also have a slight inventory headwind on sales. So those are some of the drivers. I would say, as I think about the guide on sales for the full year, and I guess the implied Q4 around 8%. I would say there's probably less likely to be upside to that number. And if some of the risks would persist, we've got a lot of mitigating actions, but if some of those risks would persist, it's probably more likely to be around to the lower side than around to the high side of guide on the top line. On the margin side, yes, a couple it sort of reverses some of the benefits that we had in Q3. So you're losing some of the fixed cost absorption benefits that we had in Q3 with the higher volume. So we've got a little bit less pricing coming through in the fourth quarter that has an impact and then a more difficult lap also as part of that. So nothing structurally different in Q4, but reversal of some of those benefits that we saw in Q3, just manifesting themselves in Q4.\nBryan Spillane: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. A couple of questions, please. One is, since the inflation you're facing is largely in cocoa, it would think, one would think that like the chocolate category would have to raise prices much higher than other snacking categories. Michele, when you think about how that would affect chocolate category elasticity, do you have to factor that in? Do consumers make pricing, choose chocolate over other snacks. Do they have pricing as part of that algorithm or not?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So certainly, people are making choices across snack categories. And one of the things that we do factor in is kind of looking at cross category price elasticity, in our models. So that's always the case. I think the past two years, in particular, have just been a little bit unique in terms of what's going on in the marketplace overall. Inflation and pricing. So seeing some different dynamics there.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. And then one quick follow-up. You mentioned some headwinds related to, I think, the ERP timing and shipments for the first half of 2024. I think you said headwinds, but sometimes you ship ahead of ERP conversion. So can, Steve, can you be a little more specific as to how to think about shipment movement in the first half of next year?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. And we'll talk more about this when we give the 2024 guide too, including the inventory build and the takeout. But yes, you're right, it's more of a sales movement in first. So there's some inventory build we'll do in advance to risk mitigate just like we did for Salty here. And then we would expect to see that bleed out in the second quarter, mostly in the second quarter. So there'll probably be some higher sales or higher inventory build and some fixed cost absorption on the front end and then the reversal of that in Q2. And there'll be some costs. We'll talk more about the cost profiling, some of that we take through, the regular P&L and some of that gets non-GAAPed out, but we'll give more clarity to that as we give 2024 guidance.\nMichele Buck: And that's similar to what we saw, what we've experienced on Salty this year. where in Q3, we have the inventory build and then Q4, it starts to bleed out, work out.\nRobert Moskow: Right. Okay. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Carey: Hi good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nChris Carey: Just a quick question on Salty as well. I guess one is near term. One is more medium term. Has anything changed about how you view the category over time given the slowdown? And then can you just maybe be a bit more specific about why consumption trends should improve? Is it really just lapping comps, increased promotional activity after Q4? I know you're not doing it in Q4, but maybe more the kind of two to four-quarter trajectory and why things get better? So just what's changed your thinking of the category, if anything, over the medium term and that two to four quarter kind of dynamic on improvement?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So, I don't have any different views on the category. Snacking continues to be very strong consumer behavior, and I love our portfolio of having a very strong leadership presence in both Indulgent Snacking and Confection as well as participating in savory snacking, especially with the brands that we've acquired that have very strong consumer engagement and growth potential. So continue to feel very good about those. I think relative to the trends improving, we can't talk really about 2024. We'll come back and talk a bit about that more. But we continue to feel that we'll see similar trends in Q4 as we've seen in Q3 relative to takeaway. I mean, some differences in shipments related to S4 because the inventory will now be coming out. We built inventory in Q3. So from a shipment perspective, we'll see that difference. But from a takeaway perspective, we anticipate a continuation of what we saw in Q3.\nChris Carey: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. Good morning. A question on seasons, there's been a lot of discussion about seasons on the call. I wonder how, can you remind us what percent of your business in Confection is from seasons? And it feels like you've won in seasons in recent years. Can you just give us a sense of how much of your growth in Confection has come from seasons in recent years?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So, Seasons is between 25% and 30% of our total business on a full year basis. It varies by quarter. Obviously, Q4, we have Halloween and Holiday. So it's a much bigger percent then and of our growth, probably about the same proportion of our growth, about a third in the back half of this year.\nDavid Palmer: And then just looking ahead to 2024, wondering how you're thinking about Seasons growth in an answer to a previous question, you talked about how Seasons would be helped by capacity. You just have more ability to fulfill demand? But, and I'm wondering how you would marry that with what you're seeing from retailers and perhaps even the consumer and how you're seeing the consumers respond to existing Halloween, how you think about Seasons in 2024? Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Yes. So we think our Seasons business will be very solid in 2024. One of the key things to anticipating the next year is always realizing what your sell-through is on each current year season. So we need to get through Halloween to see what that sell-through turns out to be. We have, as mentioned earlier, a few more days about a week that we need to be able to look at that and then obviously have strong sell-through in holiday. So we need those data points, but we feel good based on where we are to date, but we'll have a better feel afterwards. The other thing that will impact 2024 is there will be a shorter Easter depending on where the date falls. And this year, Easter in 2024, I think, is March 29. So it's on the shorter side, which creates a shorter season and a little bit of pressure perspective, it just won't be as large as in years with a long season.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Hi. So I guess two questions. The short-term one is really about market share trends. I know that they've been weak in chocolate in the U.S. recently. I think the hope was that against an easy comp on Halloween that things might start to turn the corner sooner rather than later. But do you think we're going to have to wait until the beginning of next year to really see that improvement with improved innovation? And then I have a follow-up.\nMichele Buck: So from a short-term perspective, to-date, our data suggests we are winning share of Halloween. So we are pleased with that and feeling good about that. As it relates to the everyday business, there we will need to wait until 2024 to see improvement, driven by some of our stronger innovation that will really help the everyday business.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you. And then on the follow-up, the GLP-1 question, which we're all chatting about out here. I know it's too early to tell how big it's going to get probably not having a big impact today because there's, too few U.S. adults on these drugs right now. But today, how do you plan for different scenarios on that. Obviously, adult consumption versus kids is going to be different, low sugar versus full sugar items portion control. How are you thinking about planning for that scenario as it unfolds given that it's early days. Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. I mean I think you've captured it correctly. It certainly is very early days. We don't believe the GLP-1s are having a material impact on our business at this point in time. And I think we all know there's a lot of data coming out. There's still so many unknowns regarding the rate of adoption the impact on food choices, the medium- to longer-term impacts on consumers, and we're doing more work constantly to understand those future potential impacts on our categories. We have a robust planning and forecasting process, and we try and factor in all of those consumer behavior changes that we're observing, inclusive of GLP-1s and thinking through all of those right strategies that will be important for us if they do increase in adoption. One thing we feel particularly good of is the emotional nature of our categories and our brands and the role that they play in moments of celebration, Joy as you think about the Seasons but we will continue to adapt our portfolio as we have over time to make sure that we are providing consumers with what they're looking for, whether it's the products, the ingredients, the innovation, certainly, there are opportunities around portion size and pack type. And I think a lot of companies have been focused on that as you think about the potential impact of GLP-1s. And then certainly, we're always looking at opportunistic M&A as well as we have in the past.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you. And I'll pass it on.\nMichele Buck: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thank you so much. Michele, I think in the prepared remarks and you mentioned it previously, you've commented on products, I guess, on the perimeter of the store. I'm assuming where you're kind of speaking to kind of more fresh bakery and you also spoke to kind of more satiating foods. By the -- on the Salty Snacks side, you commented on snacks right?\nMichele Buck: Right.\nRob Dickerson: Is this, is this all kind of around the price point demand? Are you just trying to basically find more value at an appropriate price. And therefore, even though you let's say, you need a candy bar now you're on a cupcakes. Just trying to figure out exactly what you're speaking to? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. That is what it's about. It is about the value equation. And certainly, we do see in times where consumers are really struggling a bigger focus on kind of the gut fill, the bang for the buck in terms of filling you up. And we've seen that and heard that from, especially from lower-income consumers before. So yes, that focus on society, where we're seeing categories like Pretzels, Meat Snacks, Tortilla Chips, some of the things that are more filling, behave more strongly from a category perspective and something aerated like a rice cake or cheese puff or ready-to-eat popcorn. So yes, it is about that value for the book. Now the other thing, in addition to things like cupcakes that we did see, we did see some increase in fruit consumption, and there was not a lot of inflation in fresh produce like that. So I think there was a value perception there as well.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Makes sense. Thank you. And then just quickly, International segment. Slowed somewhat materially, especially on the volume side. And I know you called out kind of a competitive dynamic, the moderation in category growth. If you kind of optically, at least when we see the numbers in Q3 relative to the year ago and vis-\u00e0-vis what we saw in Q2. It does seem like it's almost somewhat sudden and I don't know if I'm missing something. So maybe if you could just explain what that drop is and maybe it's fully defined by just the shift in the non-U.S. holidays? Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Yes. So there was definitely the shift in the non-U.S. holidays with Diwali in India coming a little bit later. The other big thing was the rationalization of our beverage business in Mexico, which I'm not sure that we've talked as extensively about, but we had a small drink business, maybe not that small in Mexico. It was sizable for Mexico. Not highly profitable and in our continuous efforts to make sure that we are focused on the best opportunities and putting our resources against those best opportunities. We made the decision to discontinue that drink business. So that did have a meaningful impact in the range of three to four points from a top line perspective and we really first started experiencing that in Q3. We will lap for a year, have that be an impact, but it was a minimal impact on profitability because it just wasn't a highly profitable business.\nRob Dickerson: All right. Super. Thank you so much. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nJohn Baumgartner: Good morning. Thanks for the question.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nJohn Baumgartner: Maybe first off, Michele. I just wanted to come back to the market share in chocolate, because we're seeing in the Nielsen data, their share gains accruing on an accelerating basis for premium brands and even private label, which is pretty unusual. And it's coming at the expense of the more mass price offerings. To what extent do you think the strategy needs to respond more broadly to these shifts, be it through more promotion, maintaining a larger brand investment for longer? It sounds as though your view is it's more of an innovation timing issue that reverses out next year to your benefit. But is there a chance that a larger pricing or promo pivot might be required going forward?\nMichele Buck: So as we look at the market share overall in confection, certainly, we've had a negative impact from category mix with faster growth in refreshments and sweets. And with the incremental capacity we've added going to be able to unlock more of the potential for us on share within sweets. The innovation that we've talked about, in addition to helping the everyday business innovation drives merch and so that's going to be very helpful in terms of helping promo. And then also we're working through the one retailer partnering very strongly to make sure that we can adhere to some of their direction and at the same time, make sure that we're recognizing the impulsive and expandable nature of our category and making sure that we have the right plans to take that into account. We have continued to invest in our brands, and we will continue to going forward. So at this point in time, I wouldn't say that we're anticipating a very large, substantial change in our investment levels. We have strong levels in trade and consumer on the margin, we are always open to adjusting those as we see fit. And we also are really focused on making sure that the allocation is as strong as it possibly can be between trade and between media as we look holistically. We haven't seen a big, huge increase, frankly, in premium, a bit of an increase in private label, but it continues to be a very small part of the category.\nJohn Baumgartner: Okay. And I guess just following that line of thought with the just merchandising adjustment at the retailer. You mentioned it wasn't confined to Confectionery, but I mean Confectionery is also pretty valuable to retailers for profit and velocity. Do you have a sense for which categories benefited from this adjustment? It just seems odd this happens ahead of the holidays given the importance of the category and then your own innovation and capacity ramping next year. I mean, I don't know how surprising that decision was for you, but I'm just sort of curious like what, who sort of benefited from this change? Do you have any sense?\nMichele Buck: So no category really benefited, because it was an overall reduction in merchandising. So it was more of a focus on consumer experience for more open aisles and also to enable growth and support of omni-channel and the digital business from a picking of products. So we are counting on trying to drive and the retailer counting on increases in everyday velocity to be enough to offset that. And we're certainly partnering really closely to make sure we have all the right programs and plans jointly to jointly drive the category, as you mentioned, it's highly profitable. It is expandable consumption and there is an impulsive opportunity. So we continue to work hard to drive that.\nJohn Baumgartner: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Salera: Hi, guys. Thanks for squeezing us in. Can you maybe offer some commentary around the dots distribution, gaining permanent distribution at club? I know very attractive kind of value proposition for consumers. Is there a lot of bigger wins like that on the table? And does this help you kind of accelerate the value proposition when you go to retailers to say that you can have it in a large concept?\nMichele Buck: Yes. I mean I think it helps us in terms of household penetration because we are still in the process of building the household penetration on that brand. Frankly, the business is quite big given the relatively nascent household distribution. So Club is always a great venue to get that. And we continue to have some distribution opportunity on the Pretzel business overall. So we continue to be excited by that and excited that the velocities have held up pretty well despite those increases in distribution. And we also have some opportunities for select innovation. We introduced Cinnamon Sugar, which has been a great hit in the marketplace as well.\nJim Salera: Great. And then maybe if you can offer some commentary just given that Dot's seems to be insulated from some of the demand elasticity that maybe we've seen in some of the other more premium Salty offerings. What is it about Dot's? Is it just their core kind of consumer is higher income or they just have a really on-trend offering? What is it that seems that they've been able to be insulated compared to some of the other more premium Salty offerings?\nMichele Buck: Yes. I mean I think one of the biggest things we've seen from our consumer work is the society of the category. It's a very satiating snack. It's very filling. And therefore, even though it is a premium product and some of the price points are high, it delivers on that value equation with very strong society. And I would say it certainly is a very differentiated product.\nJim Salera: Great. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Melissa Poole for closing comments.\nMelissa Poole: Thank you all so much for joining us this morning, and we look forward to catching up with you in the coming days and weeks. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Voskuil",
            "content": "No. I think you hit all the key pieces. Obviously, the next time we talk, we'll have a lot more details on next year. So... Sure. Yes, I'm happy to take it. It is an important question, and we'll address it a lot more fully on the next call. I think, the key right now is there are a lot of moving pieces even since we had that call, and some things are progressing in a positive way. We talked about productivity a little bit already. Productivity was one of the upsides we talked about on the call, we're having a great year from a productivity standpoint, and I expect that to carry forward. As Michele just said, we'll continue to look at pricing in all variables, pack price architecture, regular pricing and other places for productivity. And then we're watching the commodity markets closely. And there's been a pretty significant change there, too, from the beginning of the year. And so as we get together next time, we'll be able to pull all of that together and give you a better picture on how we feel about what we said back at the investor conference. But right now, we're still looking at, as Michele said, a pretty dynamic environment. Sure, I'd be happy to do that. On the Cocoa side, our policies haven't changed. You reference the hedging horizon and those fundamentals haven't changed. I would say as we sit here today, we probably have less visibility on a full year 2024 pricing locked in that we might have had in prior years. And some of that is driven by the high pricing right now. But we're staying very close to the market and of course that influences other parts of the strategy as you mentioned like pricing. From the pricing standpoint, as Michele said, there's also nothing fundamentally has changed there in our strategy. Pricing is one -- tool and there's a lot of ways to deliver pricing and there's productivity and other things in the P&L that also have to be part of that equation. So I would say there's nothing off the table, but as we come back in 2024 and give guidance, we'll be able to give more color. And by then we'll also have another picture on where the cocoa market is headed. We talked a little bit in the last call that there is some divergence between, what we see in pricing and some of the underlying fundamentals. And we still have an aspiration at some point that that will normalize. But to the extent it doesn't, we thought that earlier this year, and it didn't play out that way. But every quarter that goes by, we get more visibility, and that will inform how we think about the pricing question. Yes. It is attractively priced. I agree with you. And so as we think about our capital allocation principles, share of purchase always plays role. We are looking at it closely again as we talk next year and how we're going to allocate capital. You can imagine that's going to play a role and we'll continue to watch what's happening on the stock price and other calls for capital. I will say, we're coming off a pretty big year of capital spending this year. It's not going to look like that next year and so that is going to allow some more cash flow to deploy to other uses. So we'll keep that in mind as we think about 2024. You bet. Yes. We have to do. So I'll start with the sales side. So the biggest driver between Q3 and Q4, and Michele said it before, was seasonal timing. We have a big seasonal timing benefit in Q3 at some at the expense of Q4. Now Q4 also has seasons. We've got Holiday as a big factor and maybe even some early Easter shipments potentially. But Holiday is not as big as Halloween. And so just from a seasonal impact, that's one of the factors. We've kind of modeled historic elasticity. So we saw some of that coming in, in Q3, and we've modeled that more fully into Q4. And, we also have a slight inventory headwind on sales. So those are some of the drivers. I would say, as I think about the guide on sales for the full year, and I guess the implied Q4 around 8%. I would say there's probably less likely to be upside to that number. And if some of the risks would persist, we've got a lot of mitigating actions, but if some of those risks would persist, it's probably more likely to be around to the lower side than around to the high side of guide on the top line. On the margin side, yes, a couple it sort of reverses some of the benefits that we had in Q3. So you're losing some of the fixed cost absorption benefits that we had in Q3 with the higher volume. So we've got a little bit less pricing coming through in the fourth quarter that has an impact and then a more difficult lap also as part of that. So nothing structurally different in Q4, but reversal of some of those benefits that we saw in Q3, just manifesting themselves in Q4. Sure. And we'll talk more about this when we give the 2024 guide too, including the inventory build and the takeout. But yes, you're right, it's more of a sales movement in first. So there's some inventory build we'll do in advance to risk mitigate just like we did for Salty here. And then we would expect to see that bleed out in the second quarter, mostly in the second quarter. So there'll probably be some higher sales or higher inventory build and some fixed cost absorption on the front end and then the reversal of that in Q2. And there'll be some costs. We'll talk more about the cost profiling, some of that we take through, the regular P&L and some of that gets non-GAAPed out, but we'll give more clarity to that as we give 2024 guidance. You bet.

            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Good morning, Andrew. Sure. So certainly, Andrew, we recognize that the world continues to be very dynamic out there, but we think we're very confident that we can pivot and adjust to those changes. If we think about things that we're anticipating strength on from a top line perspective, we've got good visibility with the capacity enabled growth, the capacity that will come online. Gummies in particular, is an area where we've not been able to fully take advantage of the growth in the Sweet segment. We're going to be in a much better position next year to do that. Certainly, some of the capacity that came online this year has been helpful to us relative to seasons and better being able to take full advantage in that area. That will be a benefit next year as well as additional Reese. Certainly, we have higher levels of innovation. Reese's' Caramel is one that we have highlighted already, but that's going to be very helpful for us in terms of driving the overall business as well as merch. We have some opportunities in distribution on salty Dot's in particular. And of course, we also have pricing carryover from this year. From a margin perspective, we know that we've got inflation that's a bit of a headwind with all-time high commodity costs in cocoa. But we also have pricing and productivity that will help to offset that. It will have some one-time pressures related to the S/4 transition. But again, that's really a transient event and will create some issues relative to inventory in the first part of the year. So that's kind of a little bit of an overview. Steve, anything you would add to that? We have not announced any incremental price increases. We always evaluate the marketplace and have a lot of factors that we consider to determine how to best grow the business. Pricing is certainly one tool. I mentioned productivity. Now that we're in a better shape from a capacity perspective, we have more ability in our supply chain to activate productivity, and then we also look at productivity across every line item of the P&L, whether its trade, media, organizational processes and make sure we're really leveraging the best capabilities and investments to drive the business. Yes. And really, what we saw from the key retailer was a reduction in merchandising, which did pull back on shipments into that retailer. And this is really about their strategy to improve the shopping experience for their consumers and also to make fulfilling online orders easier for their pickers in store. This was a change that impacted many categories. Confection was one of those, and we had a disproportionate impact because we have had a very high share of merchandising. And therefore, that pullback impacted us, but it impacted many other categories in both edibles and nonedible.  Now this, I want to point out, this is really related to every day. So as you think about Q4 and the importance of Halloween and Holiday this did not impact season. So we don't expect the same impact in Q4 given how much of our business is seasonal. We do think that this will be a headwind in the first part of 2024, where we're lapping higher levels of March. Sure. I don't anticipate that. I think this retailer, the degree of merchandising at this retailer was much greater than at many others. So I wouldn't anticipate that. Yes I think the way you characterized it is certainly correct. We have seen a normalization of patterns from consumers in terms of when they're shopping as their concerns about potential availability are not there this year like they were last year. 50% of the season does sell through in the last two weeks of October. So we still do have a bit of product to sell through. And with Halloween falling on a Tuesday, there will be a lot of sales this weekend. We have seen a little bit of softness in the season from some cohorts that have indicated affordability was a concern in their participation and it wasn't just candy it was some other seasonal categories including decoration, costumes et cetera. But we are out there building aggressive displays, the product is out there and we are continuing to drive to deliver our expectation for the season Good morning. Hi, Pam. Sure. So, I would say we're certainly continue to feel good about our category and the price realization potential in our category as we have had over the years. We focused a lot on the value equation, investing in our business and our brands to keep that strong. At the same time, we're also cognizant that, it is a different time today. We know that value and affordability continue to be top of mind for consumers as budgets are stretched, some less government assistance, the restart of student loan repayments, higher interest rates. So we've heard from consumers that they're needing to make difficult choices. So we are certainly focused on that, and making sure that we're really focused on our value equation in terms of selling to value channels, having the right opening price points, et cetera. Food has been more resilient than some other categories but we know that some of the Snap households are reporting that they're eating and buying left. So we're very cognizant of that. And we've also seen some increase in sales in some of the perimeter categories where there's been deflation versus some of the inflationary categories. That said, where we focus on, where are the growth levers that we can continue to drive, to engage consumers and that is having the right levels and the right media targeting approach to continue to keep our brands relevant. But with both the media and the creative, we know that that's important. We didn't have as much innovation this year as we think was ideal on the business, and we've really stepped that up for next year. Feel great about Reese's Caramel in particular, and we'll share some of the other innovation that's coming as we go down the pike. Seasons continues to be a big piece of our business and winning during those seasons, getting that merchandising and it is a time where there's a lot of emotional connectivity with consumers. So it's a natural time for them to come in the category. And we continue to have distribution opportunities, both in terms of some places where we were short on capacity. And we had to pull back on some core items that we're now going to be able to supply as well as some of the innate distribution opportunities that we have on the Salty business. So those are some of the places that we're focused on to really drive growth. Yes. So I'd start by saying that we have seen some softening in Salty Snacks overall. Volumes held fairly steady throughout the quarter. But growth decelerated as pricing lessened. And there was also some growth that shifted to non-measured channels. Again, we know that affordability and value are of increasing importance to consumers. And we're also seeing them really prioritize some of the more satiating snacks. So as we look at our business, certainly, we're seeing a lot of strength in Pretzels in the category as well as our Dot's distribution opportunities. And as we look at ready-to-eat Popcorn, certainly, we do know that consumers are focused a little bit more on satiety. And we've had some retailers focus on private label and merchandising in particular. As we go into next year, certainly, we'll be focused on productivity in the category. We know that some of the branded items have greater productivity and making sure we're working with retailers on taking full advantage of that continuing to invest in those brands to really grow household penetration and connectivity with consumers. And then certainly, as we look at this year, S4 impacted some of our ability to execute and really lean in as we had to focus on pulling back a bit on support on the business during Q3 and Q4, to enable that build that we needed in inventory and just to make sure that we could move through that very smoothly, and that will be a headwind for us next year. Yes. So certainly, people are making choices across snack categories. And one of the things that we do factor in is kind of looking at cross category price elasticity, in our models. So that's always the case. I think the past two years, in particular, have just been a little bit unique in terms of what's going on in the marketplace overall. Inflation and pricing. So seeing some different dynamics there. And that's similar to what we saw, what we've experienced on Salty this year. where in Q3, we have the inventory build and then Q4, it starts to bleed out, work out. Good morning. Yes. So, I don't have any different views on the category. Snacking continues to be very strong consumer behavior, and I love our portfolio of having a very strong leadership presence in both Indulgent Snacking and Confection as well as participating in savory snacking, especially with the brands that we've acquired that have very strong consumer engagement and growth potential. So continue to feel very good about those. I think relative to the trends improving, we can't talk really about 2024. We'll come back and talk a bit about that more. But we continue to feel that we'll see similar trends in Q4 as we've seen in Q3 relative to takeaway. I mean, some differences in shipments related to S4 because the inventory will now be coming out. We built inventory in Q3. So from a shipment perspective, we'll see that difference. But from a takeaway perspective, we anticipate a continuation of what we saw in Q3. Yes. So, Seasons is between 25% and 30% of our total business on a full year basis. It varies by quarter. Obviously, Q4, we have Halloween and Holiday. So it's a much bigger percent then and of our growth, probably about the same proportion of our growth, about a third in the back half of this year. Yes. So we think our Seasons business will be very solid in 2024. One of the key things to anticipating the next year is always realizing what your sell-through is on each current year season. So we need to get through Halloween to see what that sell-through turns out to be. We have, as mentioned earlier, a few more days about a week that we need to be able to look at that and then obviously have strong sell-through in holiday. So we need those data points, but we feel good based on where we are to date, but we'll have a better feel afterwards. The other thing that will impact 2024 is there will be a shorter Easter depending on where the date falls. And this year, Easter in 2024, I think, is March 29. So it's on the shorter side, which creates a shorter season and a little bit of pressure perspective, it just won't be as large as in years with a long season. Good morning. So from a short-term perspective, to-date, our data suggests we are winning share of Halloween. So we are pleased with that and feeling good about that. As it relates to the everyday business, there we will need to wait until 2024 to see improvement, driven by some of our stronger innovation that will really help the everyday business. Yes, absolutely. I mean I think you've captured it correctly. It certainly is very early days. We don't believe the GLP-1s are having a material impact on our business at this point in time. And I think we all know there's a lot of data coming out. There's still so many unknowns regarding the rate of adoption the impact on food choices, the medium- to longer-term impacts on consumers, and we're doing more work constantly to understand those future potential impacts on our categories. We have a robust planning and forecasting process, and we try and factor in all of those consumer behavior changes that we're observing, inclusive of GLP-1s and thinking through all of those right strategies that will be important for us if they do increase in adoption. One thing we feel particularly good of is the emotional nature of our categories and our brands and the role that they play in moments of celebration, Joy as you think about the Seasons but we will continue to adapt our portfolio as we have over time to make sure that we are providing consumers with what they're looking for, whether it's the products, the ingredients, the innovation, certainly, there are opportunities around portion size and pack type. And I think a lot of companies have been focused on that as you think about the potential impact of GLP-1s. And then certainly, we're always looking at opportunistic M&A as well as we have in the past. Thank you. Right. Yes, absolutely. That is what it's about. It is about the value equation. And certainly, we do see in times where consumers are really struggling a bigger focus on kind of the gut fill, the bang for the buck in terms of filling you up. And we've seen that and heard that from, especially from lower-income consumers before. So yes, that focus on society, where we're seeing categories like Pretzels, Meat Snacks, Tortilla Chips, some of the things that are more filling, behave more strongly from a category perspective and something aerated like a rice cake or cheese puff or ready-to-eat popcorn. So yes, it is about that value for the book. Now the other thing, in addition to things like cupcakes that we did see, we did see some increase in fruit consumption, and there was not a lot of inflation in fresh produce like that. So I think there was a value perception there as well. Yes. So there was definitely the shift in the non-U.S. holidays with Diwali in India coming a little bit later. The other big thing was the rationalization of our beverage business in Mexico, which I'm not sure that we've talked as extensively about, but we had a small drink business, maybe not that small in Mexico. It was sizable for Mexico. Not highly profitable and in our continuous efforts to make sure that we are focused on the best opportunities and putting our resources against those best opportunities. We made the decision to discontinue that drink business. So that did have a meaningful impact in the range of three to four points from a top line perspective and we really first started experiencing that in Q3. We will lap for a year, have that be an impact, but it was a minimal impact on profitability because it just wasn't a highly profitable business. Good morning. So as we look at the market share overall in confection, certainly, we've had a negative impact from category mix with faster growth in refreshments and sweets. And with the incremental capacity we've added going to be able to unlock more of the potential for us on share within sweets. The innovation that we've talked about, in addition to helping the everyday business innovation drives merch and so that's going to be very helpful in terms of helping promo. And then also we're working through the one retailer partnering very strongly to make sure that we can adhere to some of their direction and at the same time, make sure that we're recognizing the impulsive and expandable nature of our category and making sure that we have the right plans to take that into account. We have continued to invest in our brands, and we will continue to going forward. So at this point in time, I wouldn't say that we're anticipating a very large, substantial change in our investment levels. We have strong levels in trade and consumer on the margin, we are always open to adjusting those as we see fit. And we also are really focused on making sure that the allocation is as strong as it possibly can be between trade and between media as we look holistically. We haven't seen a big, huge increase, frankly, in premium, a bit of an increase in private label, but it continues to be a very small part of the category. So no category really benefited, because it was an overall reduction in merchandising. So it was more of a focus on consumer experience for more open aisles and also to enable growth and support of omni-channel and the digital business from a picking of products. So we are counting on trying to drive and the retailer counting on increases in everyday velocity to be enough to offset that. And we're certainly partnering really closely to make sure we have all the right programs and plans jointly to jointly drive the category, as you mentioned, it's highly profitable. It is expandable consumption and there is an impulsive opportunity. So we continue to work hard to drive that. Yes. I mean I think it helps us in terms of household penetration because we are still in the process of building the household penetration on that brand. Frankly, the business is quite big given the relatively nascent household distribution. So Club is always a great venue to get that. And we continue to have some distribution opportunity on the Pretzel business overall. So we continue to be excited by that and excited that the velocities have held up pretty well despite those increases in distribution. And we also have some opportunities for select innovation. We introduced Cinnamon Sugar, which has been a great hit in the marketplace as well. Yes. I mean I think one of the biggest things we've seen from our consumer work is the society of the category. It's a very satiating snack. It's very filling. And therefore, even though it is a premium product and some of the price points are high, it delivers on that value equation with very strong society. And I would say it certainly is a very differentiated product."

With that, I will turn it over to the Operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first questions come from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your questions.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much, and good morning, everybody.\nMichele Buck: Good morning, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: Good morning. I want to ask a bit about the pricing versus volume commentary regarding the full year sales growth outlook. And the comments sounds like you expect price to be a bit better in the second half and maybe volume is a bit worse than originally planned. So just two questions on this. First, how do we think about the balance between the two in the second half and could volume be down year-over-year in 2H? And then more specifically on volume, is the weaker than anticipated volume fully due to just the new pricing actions or are you reflecting a tougher consumer or a competitive environment in that outlook or both? Thanks so much.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. I am happy to take that one, Andrew. Your math is right. That\u2019s the way we are looking at it. And the price piece, it really is driven or the volume impact really is driven by the extra price impact as we look at the back half. And as we look at volume in the back half, yes, year-over-year, we expect it to be down. But it really is price driven. There\u2019s probably a very small portion attributable to the salty misstep in Q2, but the vast majority is just the reaction to price.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Great. Thanks so much. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions. Bryan, could you check if yourself muted please.\nMelissa Poole: All right. Let\u2019s come back to Bryan.\nOperator: Okay. Our next questions come from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your questions.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thanks so much. You have done a great job obviously implementing pricing to offset inflation, but cocoa and sugar are up a lot more. I know you can\u2019t talk about pricing that hasn\u2019t been announced to the trade yet. But is it reasonable to think that you are maybe considering another list price increase and at what point do you start to ask how high is too high, how do you think about elasticity in the consumer in that environment? I just wanted to get a sense for kind of the puts and takes as you think about how to deal with and manage maybe what continues to be an inflationary environment for you?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. I mean, you are right. Cocoa and sugar are historically high. I think I saw a news article this morning talking about cocoa being at a 12-year high on the New York Exchange. The good news is we have got experience managing through commodity rushes up and down. And so as we talked about in the past, as we look at dealing with that, price is a lever, but it\u2019s not the only lever. And so we look at driving more productivity, driving efficiency through other parts of the P&L, and in general, driving revenue management is part of our ongoing strategy. And so all the usual levers will be applied, and as I said, it\u2019s not the first time we have had to deal with something like this. So we are pretty good at being able to navigate, and you are right, we are not going to get more specific than that at this stage.\nKen Goldman: Thank you. And then just on the comment about increased competitive, I guess, innovation in confectionery in North America. How incremental is the innovation that you are seeing, any real surprises in there versus your prior expectations? It\u2019s been such a -- I don\u2019t want to say a benign competitive environment, because, obviously, you have some tough players in the market, but is it getting more intense than what you would have expected, I guess, is what I am going for there?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. So I would say the innovation is up off of a relatively low base. So it\u2019s having an impact based on that. I think many folks have been focused, certainly, we have been focused a lot on execution and meeting demand for the past few years and focused on the core with innovation not playing as big of a role. And I think now we are just seeing competitors in the marketplace start to dial up the innovation more back to historic levels, and as we go forward, that\u2019s certainly an area that we are going to be focused on as we are continuing to increase capacity at the same time.\nKen Goldman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your questions.\nMax Gumport: Hi. Thanks for the question. With regard to the increased chocolate capacity this year and the additional co-manufacturing capacity secured in sweets for next year? Is there any way you can help us dimensionalize how sizable those capacity increases are, just as we try to get a sense of how impactful these additions could be for volumes in the second half and also in 2024? Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. We -- I think we have said in the past that if you took a look at the capacity that we have coming online this year that\u2019s already gone into place and then what\u2019s coming in the back half, and look kind of year-over-year, you are somewhere in the 5% range of the incremental capacity across chocolate and sweets.\nMax Gumport: Great. Thanks very much.\nSteve Voskuil: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.\nMichael Lavery: Hi. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: You have got the integration in salty snacks and the transition to SAP that you have been talking about and those never seem to be totally smooth or easy, you mentioned there\u2019s some hiccups that you have seen. But can you just maybe give a little sense of what those look like in a little more detail, and specifically with an eye on just having a sense of what\u2019s to come, what have you learned and how confident are you that the rest of the year can avoid some of those hiccups or just be even smoother still?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. I mean, I would say overall, certainly, one of our key focuses as we planned for this year, was that at the enterprise level really focusing on the stellar execution. We planned the business in a way to assume that we would be trying to front-load performance knowing that there are always hiccups in the execution and so in Q4 we do expect to see volumes be down and we put that in our plans. The teams are all over it. It is a focused effort, not just within IT, but across every functional area of the salty business. And so far we have been doing pretty well on salty with household penetration growing, repeat frequency, strong sales. We did have the promotional shift into Q3. We feel good about being able to execute that. But we feel like we are well geared up to be able to execute that. That said, we certainly do believe that there will be volatility in the back half of the year with the ups and downs that\u2019s forward.\nMichele Buck: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just back to pricing, you have got delays in some of the timing between the announcement and implementation, and then the seasons, of course, have a staggered effect and with just some of the maybe layers to it. Can you give a sense of just what you have announced already or put in place already has as an impact on 2024? It looks like at least the low single-digit, maybe my math, I guesses or estimates close to it, 3 points that you might already have in hand. Is that about right or what are some of the moving parts, just so we have kind of a little bit further look ahead of what\u2019s already put in place?\nMichele Buck: So we have high single digits in the second half of this year and as we look to 2024, low single-digit pricing.\nMichael Lavery: And just to clarify, that\u2019s without any other -- that would be before there\u2019s anything else that might still be to come, right?\nMichele Buck: That\u2019s what we have announced.\nMichael Lavery: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your questions.\nPamela Kaufman: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nPamela Kaufman: Your advertising spend was up 15% this quarter, which is an acceleration from Q1. Given the better-than-expected performance in gross margins for the year and what you are seeing in the competitive and demand environment, are there any changes to your plans for marketing spend for this year relative to before?\nSteve Voskuil: No fundamental changes. We had expected this year to be a year to invest in brands, and again, as we have capacity coming online and leaning into seasons, especially if we get to the back half, a significant increase in brand investment was planned and we are executing to that plan.\nMichele Buck: And also as mentioned, we were working to really front-load more of our salty planning because of S/4. So our plans accounted for that as well.\nPamela Kaufman: And then just in the prepared remarks, there are comments about some private label launches in your Salty Snacks categories. You are generally in categories that face very little private label competition, but considering the launches that you alluded to. Just curious to hear how you are thinking about managing private label competition in your categories and how you are addressing it?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. So, certainly, there is a bit more private label in salty than in CMG. But we have considered -- we have continued to see that, while private label has ticked up a bit, our brands have continued to remain quite strong and do incredibly well. And as we look at private label, even within the confection category, while there has been increased activity there, it\u2019s remained a very small part of the category less than 3% and the entries we have seen in the marketplace this year are still relatively small. So we don\u2019t take our leadership for granted. We certainly continue to invest in our brands to make sure that our propositions are strong. But we feel very well about how we are competing right now in the marketplace on that.\nPamela Kaufman: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions.\nNik Modi: Yeah. Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I was\u2026\nMichele Buck: Good morning, Nik.\nNik Modi: Good morning. I was hoping you could just kind of address the Halloween season as it relates to some of your competitors still struggling with supply chain and have cut back their orders. I am just curious, do you -- how can you take advantage of this, do you have visibility at this point in terms of maybe securing some of that missed opportunity by some of your competitors? Just wanted to get some clarity on how you think about that as it relates to the third quarter?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. So we are expecting a very strong Halloween. We know that customers are planning big displays and we are certainly participating in that and as well have strong marketing support to consumers planned as well. So we have certainly taken an approach of leaning into Halloween. We feel good that there will be plenty of candy out there. So feeling good about that. As we look at overall in the back half as it relates to market share, we think that there will be a stable approach overall, but some pressure on everyday despite some of our strengths around the seasons.\nNik Modi: Great. And then if I could just clarify, in terms of the execution issues in Salty Snacks, what exactly happened, so you talked about systems changeover, but can you just provide just the details on exactly like what the problem was?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. I mean, I\u2019d say, two key things. One is we had some promotions that we had planned to occur in Q2 that shifted to Q3 and then we have had some just basic issues as we have been bringing together all of those businesses that you would expect during a transition like that around sales and commercial and supply chain execution. So things just weren\u2019t as connected as they needed to be. We feel very good that the team is on it and focused on it and execution is something that we tend to do very well, so we have a lot of confidence in our ability to focus and get that back around. That said, of course, the back half of the year, as we have mentioned, is going to be -- have a lot of volatility that\u2019s really tied to as we build inventory and then work through the implementation and anticipate that we will have lighter sales in the fourth quarter as a result of that, but we have confidence in our ability to fix the execution.\nNik Modi: Great. Thanks so much. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your questions.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nAlexia Howard: Can I ask, first of all, about market share trends in U.S. chocolate? It sounds as though capacity constraints and other issues have caused some of those declines. Do you have a view as to when those market share trends should start to improve and turn positive again?\nMichele Buck: So we expect to continue to see pressure in the back half of the year. We believe that we will start to see some improvement, but there are a couple of things that are really impacting share. So one certainly is around category mix, with refreshment and sweets being stronger than we had anticipated. Chocolate should improve and we are focused on increasing our level of innovation to be even more competitive and we will be in a better position to do that as we continue to have more capacity come online.\nAlexia Howard: Great. And then as a\u2026\nMichele Buck: We have increment in REIT [ph]. Yeah. Go ahead.\nAlexia Howard: I am sorry. No. I was going to say, moving on to Salty Snacks, you talked about a double-digit decline, I think, in the fourth quarter because of the transformation. Is that choppiness expected to persist into 2024?\nSteve Voskuil: No.\nMichele Buck: No.\nSteve Voskuil: Not at this stage. Really it\u2019s just -- Q3 we will be getting ready and building inventory for the switchover, Q4 will be the switchover and the recovery. So by the time we get to the first quarter, we would expect to be back on -- back or very close to a regular glide path. Yeah.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.\nSteve Voskuil: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Matt Smith with Stifel. Please proceed with your questions.\nMatt Smith: Hi. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nMatt Smith: Steve, I wanted to dig in a little bit on gross margin. You had a really solid first half with margin expansion up near 100 basis points and you again increased the margin expectations for the year. So could you talk about the drivers of margin expansion relative to your initial expectations and what\u2019s weighing on the expansion in the second half relative to the performance in the first half. Is that tougher comparisons in relation to the balance of pricing and inflation or are there other factors at play, like, increased promotion?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yeah. We are pleased with the gross margin performance through the first half and we have had a few things, I think, that have broken our way. We have seen less inflation in things like packaging and logistics and even some material costs. Our productivity progress has been strong. I think we feel really good about where we are at the midyear mark on productivity, and then, of course, we have had pricing drop through. So all of those have worked in our favor and will continue to some degree as we go to the back half. If you look at the back half, taking the volume impact, we are going to have some more fixed cost absorption impact that will be a little bit of a weight. And again, we have got hedging against commodities, but still from a year-over-year and beginning of the year, end of year perspective, we still have a bit more cost for some of the inflationary commodities, cocoa and sugar, smaller weights, and again, smoothed out by hedging, but still some impact. Those would probably be the two biggest drags as we look to the back half. But again, overall, I still feel confident in taking our guidance up and the team is doing a nice job managing the cost side.\nMatt Smith: Thank you for that. And just as a follow-up, if I understood what you were saying about the second half. There should be a nice gross margin benefit in the third quarter as you build inventory with retailers ahead of the cutover in Salty Snacks, is that right?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. Yeah. We will get some benefit. Again, salty is not the biggest business, but we will get some absorption benefit as we build inventory in salty. Yeah.\nMatt Smith: Okay. Thanks for that. I will pass it on.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Cody Ross with UBS. Please proceed with your questions.\nCody Ross: Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. A couple of housekeeping ones and then a longer term one in nature. First one, I think, you spoke about inventory headwinds in the quarter. I think they were lapping the inventory replenishment last year and the pull forward of sales into 1Q from 2Q. Is that correct, and if so, can you quantify each one for us?\nSteve Voskuil: It is correct. In terms of breaking out the pieces. There\u2019s about 300 basis points we attribute to the last and about 150-basis-point shift relative to Q1 order of magnitude.\nCody Ross: Great. Thank you. Other housekeeping question, just as far as the 4Q, I think, you guys said that, sales should be down double digits in the salty business due to the ERP implementation. Can you just quantify that for us or give us an expectation for magnitude? And then just one last one.\nSteve Voskuil: In terms of dollars or...\nCody Ross: Yeah. The dollars that you are expecting from the implementation.\nMelissa Poole: Yeah. As we get that...\nMichele Buck: Yeah. No. That\u2019s a double-digit decline. So we not going to go any more specific than that.\nCody Ross: Understood. And then last question, just on the competitive environment. There\u2019s been a lot of news in the headlines lately about private label and other branded competitors becoming more competitive. What are you seeing in competitive -- in the competitive environment? I know you said you have seen branded players pick up more innovation, besides that, are you seeing any step-up in promotions and what\u2019s kind of your expectation going forward? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. I mean, I\u2019d say, the categories that we are in have always been very competitive. But the good thing is we have rational competitors. And what we are seeing overall, I\u2019d say, is pretty consistent with what we have seen historically. We have seen some higher levels of innovation as supply chains have gotten stronger and people have been able to support innovation. We have seen some increases in private label, I think, with the economic environment in both confection and in salty. But frankly, the results of those entries have been somewhat mixed, and certainly, our brands have held up really well. We continue to focus on driving sustainable profitable growth. As it relates to infection and promotional activity, display has always been important for that impulse-driven category and so we didn\u2019t see as much of the change in promotion as perhaps some other categories have seen. So that\u2019s been much more stable for us and we anticipate we will continue to going forward. So we will continue to invest robustly to drive our brands with innovation, marketing support, what we think is the right level of promotion.\nCody Ross: Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your questions.\nJason English: Hey, folks. Good morning. Thanks for fitting me in. Couple of questions.\nMichele Buck: Hi.\nJason English: First, on Salty Snacks, promotion shift, it seems odd, usually promotions are locked in well-advanced retailers. So was this an issue of you actually not having a promotion your planned for like at this time was your sales and finance functions or did a retailer actually cancel activity on you?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. Retailers did not cancel activity on us, but it was really our choice to move a promotion. So that piece is that. And then relative to our broader execution issues, we had some temporary out of stocks. We go to market differently with dots than we do with SkinnyPop and the team quickly adjusted and we have seen our service levels improve. So we don\u2019t expect to see that kind of impact in the second half.\nJason English: Okay. So you canceled promotional activity on your retailer. Is that because of supply constraints or what drove that decision?\nMichele Buck: No. We have really shifted to investing a promotion in the third quarter that we thought made a lot of sense in advance of S/4. It was a big opportunity for us.\nJason English: Okay. Switching gears, kind of coming back to Mr. Goldman\u2019s line of question earlier, I had a couple of other lines of question on competitive activity. Your release has a tremendous amount of focus on market share and rather than driving category growth and we have seen the category actually weakened quite a bit in recent data. It\u2019s a two-part question. First, what do you attribute the accelerating volume declines in chocolate confection to be driven by? And second, are you incenting organization on share and assuming you are based on the heavy emphasis in the release and prepared comments, how do you manage the risk of us getting back to where we were five years, six years, seven years ago, where it was sort of you always duking it out promoting away value in the category rather than what has been a much more, I would say, constructive competitive environment we have seen over the last couple of years?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. Well, as we look at the category, certainly, we have had significant pricing in the category. We have 20% price, and over time, we should see some moderation and the volume decline should moderate as well. So, certainly, price has played a factor. I would say we are always focused on driving the category, as well as market share, because being the category leader, we know if we drive the category we stand to have some of the greatest benefits. So we certainly don\u2019t approach this as duking it out, but rather, how do we continue to connect with consumers and partner with our retail customers to maximize what\u2019s going to be best to drive the overall business in category?\nSteve Voskuil: And we have got a lot more tools and sophistication today to look at the ROIs for how we are deploying things like promotion and there\u2019s no intent to get into an arms race of bad returning investments like that. We will have -- we want to win with innovation, which we talked about in the remarks not just spending.\nMelissa Poole: Yeah. I think, Jason, if it helps a little, too. We had the past, call it, two months or so, multiple price increases, three different price increases hitting retailers at the same time, which is kind of what drove that 20% Michele mentioned as kind of some of we were at the tail end of lapping some and some new ones we are going in. So we would expect that pricing number to come down and with that the volume declines to moderate as well. So in the next couple of months we would expect that to normalize a bit.\nJason English: Okay. And I am going to cheat with one quick follow-up related to that question. But to my point on how are you been sending the organization, your sales force in particular, is the market share component to the bonus or is it just deliver the revenue?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. Today market share is not a component of most bonuses, it\u2019s about delivering the revenue, but we have other metrics around quality of delivery and how it\u2019s delivered and where...\nMelissa Poole: Sales activity based margins that enable a balance between sales and profitable sales.\nSteve Voskuil: That\u2019s right.\nJason English: Got it. That is helpful. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.\nSteve Voskuil: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Connor Rattigan with Consumer Edge Research. Please proceed with your questions.\nConnor Rattigan: Good morning. Thanks for the question. So I guess as we think about the pricing environment and increasing elasticity going forward, should we view your on capacity is just meeting existing underlying demand or is there may be an opportunity to allocate some of that newfound capacity to take advantage of some strategic revenue management opportunities, such as package resizing or bar weights to drive net price realization going forward?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. We have been very focused on strategic revenue management and pack price architecture on both confection and the salty categories. I think a few years ago, we talked about evolving our pricing approach from just list pricing to how we look more holistically at strategic pricing. And in these categories in particular, it\u2019s a big opportunity. We continue to focus there in confection and on salty it\u2019s certainly something that as we acquired these businesses was a real underdeveloped area of opportunity.\nConnor Rattigan: Great. Thank you. I will pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. I just have two questions. I just want to circle back to some of the comments you made, Steve, just on cocoa and sugar inflation that Ken asked. It sounds like there clearly are other offset besides pricing that you can act to kind of help alleviate, let\u2019s say, soften some of that pressure over the next two years given your hedging schedule, but clearly, cocoa has also inflated fairly materially over the past few months. I am just curious like when I try to combine the comments from the offsets, but then the comments, I think, or which -- in the prepared remarks about potential more promotional activity next year and all the pricing you have taken is like, do you feel like you are kind of reaching this point such that maybe market share is a little softer, maybe that\u2019s driven by capacity, capacity is coming online or maybe you need to promote, but also maybe you kind of have kind of hit certain price points that you have to be like very careful with at this point on the everyday side of the business and maybe you don\u2019t really want to take more pricing, but if you hadn\u2019t, you would? So I am just trying to get a sense as to like why you wouldn\u2019t want to basically take a little bit more given where the input cost complex is? Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. I mean, we will take -- those are all the kind of considerations that we look at when we think about 2024 and beyond. And again, we look at the whole P&L, we look at market share, we look at what competition is doing. And clearly, we look at commodities and where we think they are headed. And so I don\u2019t want to get more specific on the construct of the 2024 plan, but those are the kind of things we will consider. Again, we have navigated this before. We have got a lot of levers at our disposal. Pricing and revenue is reset just one of those levers and it will be interesting to see what happens in the cocoa and sugar market. I do think in those cases there\u2019s still a lot of speculation. And again, our hedging strategy gives us an element of smoothing and protection to a degree to that. But we will be watching to see how these markets hold up, because they are at pretty high levels atypically and it\u2019s not driven by fundamentals to a large degree.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Fair enough. And then just quickly, the comment on Halloween should be very strong. Michele, you said plenty of candy, it sounds like Halloween seasonal sales expected to be up double-digit. So I am just curious, like, why do you think Halloween will be so strong this year, number one? And then number two, I think, last year you did have some benefit from early shipments, so I just want to make sure there aren\u2019t quite earlier shipments coming? That\u2019s it. Thanks so much.\nMichele Buck: Sure. So we get a lot of visibility to the seasons, because we plan with customers in advance relative to needing to build inventory for the season. So we have a lot of good visibility in terms of what is being bought and we have very strong programs to drive sell-through. So that gives us a lot of confidence. We know that during difficult economic times, consumers are particularly interested in enjoying kind of the simple things in life, like these seasons, like Halloween and so that\u2019s another kind of tailwind of focus relative to our conviction and why I think we and our customer partners really want to lean into Halloween.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Fair enough. And then on the shipment side, it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s any delta there relative to the year ago?\nSteve Voskuil: No.\nMichele Buck: No.\nRob Dickerson: All right. Super. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your questions.\nChris Carey: Hi. Good morning, everyone.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nChris Carey: So just a question kind of clarification around salty. We have seen some deceleration in consumption, namely volume in recent scanner data. And I am just trying to understand and apologies if this has kind of been addressed in some form, but just to clarify. Was any of that because of lack of supply because of a shift in promotional programs? Said another way, as supply ramps in Q3, it sounds like there\u2019s some shift in promotional programs, would you expect the consumption trends? I realize what you are saying about your reported results in Q3 and Q4, but would you expect consumption trends to pick up or is what we are seeing perhaps more indicative of underlying demand? So I just want to maybe understand how you think about the balance of those things?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. So promotional declines did drive that deceleration, and yes, we do expect that to pick up in Q3 going forward.\nChris Carey: Okay. That\u2019s helpful enough. Thanks so much.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your questions.\nBryan Spillane: Thanks, Operator. Hey. Good morning, guys.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nBryan Spillane: So two quick ones for me. One, just a follow-up on elasticity and another one on capital allocation. So first on elasticity, Michele, is there any pronounced differences across channels? So I guess small format immediate consumption versus large box, just anything there to call out in terms of where the -- if there\u2019s any differences in terms of elasticity across those channels or consumption occasions?\nMichele Buck: I don\u2019t think that we have seen anything significant across channels. No.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And then, Steve, just on capital allocation, I noticed the dividend increase of 15% and that, obviously, makes the dividend more competitive, I guess, with interest rates going up. But just can you remind us, again, as we kind of think about, think over the next couple of years and as capital spending normalizes and again assuming that there\u2019s not some major strategic event that would affect the balance sheet. Just how you are thinking about capital allocation and returning cash to shareholders going forward, and again, would it be more dividends, would share repurchases become a more pronounced piece? Just kind of how you are thinking about that as we think about it over the next couple of years would be helpful? Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yeah. I\u2019d be happy to. No fundamental changes in our capital allocation philosophy that we talked about back at the Investor Conference. It is a great dividend increase. When you look at that and you look at our target for payout ratio and so on. We are still, even with this increase a little bit behind where we would like to be and where we have been historically. So that just reflects the great earnings progress over the last few years, but pleased with the 15% increase. And you are right, as we look forward, as capital spending moderates off some of the really high spending we have had here recently, we are going to look for other ways to be thoughtful with the capital and returning cash to shareholders through repurchases, for example, is our stop gap when we don\u2019t have better-returning alternatives and so still that\u2019s not going to change.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your questions.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. Thank you for the question. Similar to Bryan about elasticity look slightly different. I want to know if you have seen any differences in elasticity within the portfolio, like, multi-serve bags versus single-serve, especially heading into Halloween, some of those bags can cost $20, $25 at retail. Have you seen any observations in consumer behavior about just the absolute price points affecting demand?\nMichele Buck: So nothing material relative to the pack size piece. I mean, what we have tended to see over time is, seasons tend to perform better, to be less elastic and I think that\u2019s just the nature of people are going to participate. So that\u2019s the biggest difference that we see.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. So -- and any -- so no real change in like single-serve demand affected by traffic or just the absolute price point of the bars getting up there?\nMichele Buck: No.\nRobert Moskow: Okay.\nMichele Buck: We have not seen.\nRobert Moskow: All right. Thank you. Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next questions come from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your questions.\nDavid Palmer: Hi. Thanks. At your Analyst Day, you provided guidance of North America Confection organic sales in the low single digits including flattish volume. Could you remind us again of the drivers to sustain that sales growth with low single-digit pricing at flat volume as perhaps competition returns in a more fulsome manner? Thanks so much.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. I would say nothing fundamental changing in that algorithm the way we think about the sources of growth for U.S. Confection or the rest of the business. I mean we always expect it to be a competitive category over time and so we are looking at it the same way. There\u2019s nothing that\u2019s happening this quarter or even for the balance of this year that we think fundamentally changes any of that.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks very much.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. I am showing no further questions in the queue at this time. I\u2019d like to hand the call back over to Ms. Melissa Poole for any closing comments.\nMelissa Poole: Yeah. Thanks so much for joining us this morning. I know it was a particularly busy morning of earnings. So thanks for all of the great questions and look forward to catching up with you all later today for any outstanding ones you may have. Have a great day everyone.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. We appreciate your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Enjoy the rest of your day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Steve Voskuil",
            "content": "Yeah. I am happy to take that one, Andrew. Your math is right. That's the way we are looking at it. And the price piece, it really is driven or the volume impact really is driven by the extra price impact as we look at the back half. And as we look at volume in the back half, yes, year-over-year, we expect it to be down. But it really is price driven. There's probably a very small portion attributable to the salty misstep in Q2, but the vast majority is just the reaction to price. Sure. I mean, you are right. Cocoa and sugar are historically high. I think I saw a news article this morning talking about cocoa being at a 12-year high on the New York Exchange. The good news is we have got experience managing through commodity rushes up and down. And so as we talked about in the past, as we look at dealing with that, price is a lever, but it's not the only lever. And so we look at driving more productivity, driving efficiency through other parts of the P&L, and in general, driving revenue management is part of our ongoing strategy. And so all the usual levers will be applied, and as I said, it's not the first time we have had to deal with something like this. So we are pretty good at being able to navigate, and you are right, we are not going to get more specific than that at this stage. Yeah. We -- I think we have said in the past that if you took a look at the capacity that we have coming online this year that's already gone into place and then what's coming in the back half, and look kind of year-over-year, you are somewhere in the 5% range of the incremental capacity across chocolate and sweets. You bet. Good morning. Good morning. No fundamental changes. We had expected this year to be a year to invest in brands, and again, as we have capacity coming online and leaning into seasons, especially if we get to the back half, a significant increase in brand investment was planned and we are executing to that plan. No. Not at this stage. Really it's just -- Q3 we will be getting ready and building inventory for the switchover, Q4 will be the switchover and the recovery. So by the time we get to the first quarter, we would expect to be back on -- back or very close to a regular glide path. Yeah. You bet. Sure. Yeah. We are pleased with the gross margin performance through the first half and we have had a few things, I think, that have broken our way. We have seen less inflation in things like packaging and logistics and even some material costs. Our productivity progress has been strong. I think we feel really good about where we are at the midyear mark on productivity, and then, of course, we have had pricing drop through. So all of those have worked in our favor and will continue to some degree as we go to the back half. If you look at the back half, taking the volume impact, we are going to have some more fixed cost absorption impact that will be a little bit of a weight. And again, we have got hedging against commodities, but still from a year-over-year and beginning of the year, end of year perspective, we still have a bit more cost for some of the inflationary commodities, cocoa and sugar, smaller weights, and again, smoothed out by hedging, but still some impact. Those would probably be the two biggest drags as we look to the back half. But again, overall, I still feel confident in taking our guidance up and the team is doing a nice job managing the cost side. Yeah. Yeah. We will get some benefit. Again, salty is not the biggest business, but we will get some absorption benefit as we build inventory in salty. Yeah. Thank you. It is correct. In terms of breaking out the pieces. There's about 300 basis points we attribute to the last and about 150-basis-point shift relative to Q1 order of magnitude. In terms of dollars or... Yeah. And we have got a lot more tools and sophistication today to look at the ROIs for how we are deploying things like promotion and there's no intent to get into an arms race of bad returning investments like that. We will have -- we want to win with innovation, which we talked about in the remarks not just spending. Yeah. Today market share is not a component of most bonuses, it's about delivering the revenue, but we have other metrics around quality of delivery and how it's delivered and where... That's right.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Good morning, Andrew. Yeah. So I would say the innovation is up off of a relatively low base. So it's having an impact based on that. I think many folks have been focused, certainly, we have been focused a lot on execution and meeting demand for the past few years and focused on the core with innovation not playing as big of a role. And I think now we are just seeing competitors in the marketplace start to dial up the innovation more back to historic levels, and as we go forward, that's certainly an area that we are going to be focused on as we are continuing to increase capacity at the same time. Good morning. Yeah. I mean, I would say overall, certainly, one of our key focuses as we planned for this year, was that at the enterprise level really focusing on the stellar execution. We planned the business in a way to assume that we would be trying to front-load performance knowing that there are always hiccups in the execution and so in Q4 we do expect to see volumes be down and we put that in our plans. The teams are all over it. It is a focused effort, not just within IT, but across every functional area of the salty business. And so far we have been doing pretty well on salty with household penetration growing, repeat frequency, strong sales. We did have the promotional shift into Q3. We feel good about being able to execute that. But we feel like we are well geared up to be able to execute that. That said, we certainly do believe that there will be volatility in the back half of the year with the ups and downs that's forward. Okay. That's helpful. And just back to pricing, you have got delays in some of the timing between the announcement and implementation, and then the seasons, of course, have a staggered effect and with just some of the maybe layers to it. Can you give a sense of just what you have announced already or put in place already has as an impact on 2024? It looks like at least the low single-digit, maybe my math, I guesses or estimates close to it, 3 points that you might already have in hand. Is that about right or what are some of the moving parts, just so we have kind of a little bit further look ahead of what's already put in place? So we have high single digits in the second half of this year and as we look to 2024, low single-digit pricing. That's what we have announced. Good morning. And also as mentioned, we were working to really front-load more of our salty planning because of S/4. So our plans accounted for that as well. Yeah. So, certainly, there is a bit more private label in salty than in CMG. But we have considered -- we have continued to see that, while private label has ticked up a bit, our brands have continued to remain quite strong and do incredibly well. And as we look at private label, even within the confection category, while there has been increased activity there, it's remained a very small part of the category less than 3% and the entries we have seen in the marketplace this year are still relatively small. So we don't take our leadership for granted. We certainly continue to invest in our brands to make sure that our propositions are strong. But we feel very well about how we are competing right now in the marketplace on that. Good morning, Nik. Yeah. So we are expecting a very strong Halloween. We know that customers are planning big displays and we are certainly participating in that and as well have strong marketing support to consumers planned as well. So we have certainly taken an approach of leaning into Halloween. We feel good that there will be plenty of candy out there. So feeling good about that. As we look at overall in the back half as it relates to market share, we think that there will be a stable approach overall, but some pressure on everyday despite some of our strengths around the seasons. Yeah. I mean, I'd say, two key things. One is we had some promotions that we had planned to occur in Q2 that shifted to Q3 and then we have had some just basic issues as we have been bringing together all of those businesses that you would expect during a transition like that around sales and commercial and supply chain execution. So things just weren't as connected as they needed to be. We feel very good that the team is on it and focused on it and execution is something that we tend to do very well, so we have a lot of confidence in our ability to focus and get that back around. That said, of course, the back half of the year, as we have mentioned, is going to be -- have a lot of volatility that's really tied to as we build inventory and then work through the implementation and anticipate that we will have lighter sales in the fourth quarter as a result of that, but we have confidence in our ability to fix the execution. Good morning. So we expect to continue to see pressure in the back half of the year. We believe that we will start to see some improvement, but there are a couple of things that are really impacting share. So one certainly is around category mix, with refreshment and sweets being stronger than we had anticipated. Chocolate should improve and we are focused on increasing our level of innovation to be even more competitive and we will be in a better position to do that as we continue to have more capacity come online. We have increment in REIT [ph]. Yeah. Go ahead. No. Good morning. Yeah. No. That's a double-digit decline. So we not going to go any more specific than that. Yeah. I mean, I'd say, the categories that we are in have always been very competitive. But the good thing is we have rational competitors. And what we are seeing overall, I'd say, is pretty consistent with what we have seen historically. We have seen some higher levels of innovation as supply chains have gotten stronger and people have been able to support innovation. We have seen some increases in private label, I think, with the economic environment in both confection and in salty. But frankly, the results of those entries have been somewhat mixed, and certainly, our brands have held up really well. We continue to focus on driving sustainable profitable growth. As it relates to infection and promotional activity, display has always been important for that impulse-driven category and so we didn't see as much of the change in promotion as perhaps some other categories have seen. So that's been much more stable for us and we anticipate we will continue to going forward. So we will continue to invest robustly to drive our brands with innovation, marketing support, what we think is the right level of promotion. Hi. Yeah. Retailers did not cancel activity on us, but it was really our choice to move a promotion. So that piece is that. And then relative to our broader execution issues, we had some temporary out of stocks. We go to market differently with dots than we do with SkinnyPop and the team quickly adjusted and we have seen our service levels improve. So we don't expect to see that kind of impact in the second half. No. We have really shifted to investing a promotion in the third quarter that we thought made a lot of sense in advance of S/4. It was a big opportunity for us. Yeah. Well, as we look at the category, certainly, we have had significant pricing in the category. We have 20% price, and over time, we should see some moderation and the volume decline should moderate as well. So, certainly, price has played a factor. I would say we are always focused on driving the category, as well as market share, because being the category leader, we know if we drive the category we stand to have some of the greatest benefits. So we certainly don't approach this as duking it out, but rather, how do we continue to connect with consumers and partner with our retail customers to maximize what's going to be best to drive the overall business in category? Yeah. We have been very focused on strategic revenue management and pack price architecture on both confection and the salty categories. I think a few years ago, we talked about evolving our pricing approach from just list pricing to how we look more holistically at strategic pricing. And in these categories in particular, it's a big opportunity. We continue to focus there in confection and on salty it's certainly something that as we acquired these businesses was a real underdeveloped area of opportunity. Sure. So we get a lot of visibility to the seasons, because we plan with customers in advance relative to needing to build inventory for the season. So we have a lot of good visibility in terms of what is being bought and we have very strong programs to drive sell-through. So that gives us a lot of confidence. We know that during difficult economic times, consumers are particularly interested in enjoying kind of the simple things in life, like these seasons, like Halloween and so that's another kind of tailwind of focus relative to our conviction and why I think we and our customer partners really want to lean into Halloween. No. Good morning. Yeah. So promotional declines did drive that deceleration, and yes, we do expect that to pick up in Q3 going forward. Good morning. I don't think that we have seen anything significant across channels. No. So nothing material relative to the pack size piece. I mean, what we have tended to see over time is, seasons tend to perform better, to be less elastic and I think that's just the nature of people are going to participate. So that's the biggest difference that we see. No. We have not seen."

        "content": "Operator: Greetings and welcome to The Hershey Company First Quarter 2023 Question-and-Answer Session. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. As a reminder this conference is being recorded. I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin.\nMelissa Poole: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's first quarter 2023 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our pre-recorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the pre-recorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck, and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody. \nMelissa Poole: Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Yes. First off, I wanted to ask a little bit about the guidance update on the top-line. The company beat by a few points on the top-line in the quarter. But when we take out the earlier summer shipments, which is really just timing, I guess, results on organic were only slightly ahead of the street view. But Hershey raised its sales growth guidance to the high end of the previous range for the full year. So I guess my question is, what are you seeing at this stage that that gave you the confidence to shift the top-line guidance the way you did? \nMichele Buck: Yeah, thank you, Andrew. Yeah, you're exactly right. For the first quarter, the timing impact was about half of the - half the beat on the sales line and also strong performance in international. So those were the two big drivers and we look to the balance of year. Obviously, the timing is going to wash out in the second quarter, but we do expect to see a little bit better elasticities in the year to go period. We still see a moderating versus some of the strong performance we've seen the last six to nine months.  But a little bit more improvement and we're spaced that a little bit more on media investment that we also have incrementally in the year to go plan. So between, I would say, with the strength we saw in the international business, what we're seeing on the back of improved elasticities a little bit in the year to go period, that's what gives us the confidence in the race, right? \nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks for that. And then, with the pull-forward of some shipments from to Q2 into 1Q, along with the tougher, I guess, year ago organic sales and EPS growth comparisons in 2Q, I guess what are some of the key puts and takes to keep in mind when we're modeling for 2Q? Thanks so much.\nMichele Buck: Yeah, 2Q will be probably our most challenging quarter. I look to the balance of the year. We're going to have the timing piece shift back out, but then also recall last year it was a big inventory till quarter as well. And so, when you look at the laps, it's pretty tough lap. That combined with that point and a half coming out, we'll put, more to the mid-single digit range, probably from a sales standpoint. And that will put more pressure on the EPS side than the rest of the quarters. \nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. \nKen Goldman : Hi, good morning. Two questions on capacity, if I could? First, I think your prior guidance, if I had it down right, was for five new lines to come on this year. I think you're calling for some more now. So am I reading that wrong or was one delayed? And then, I'm also curious to learn a little bit more about the Weaver acquisitions just in terms of how they may help you down the road in terms of added capacity or efficiency, obviously, bringing plants in houses is generally a good thing for efficiency. But just in light of the fact that they already did make products for you. Just trying to get a little bit of a better sense of some of the benefits down the road for you. Thank you. \nMelissa Poole : Sure. So there is no change to the number of lines. There are five lines and I think there's one that we just didn't specifically call out in our remarks. So, so no difference there. Relative to Weaver, we feel very good about the acquisition. Weaver manufacturing is currently a come in of SkinnyPop. We acquired two plants and really what it gives us are three things that gives us sufficient capacity to be able to support growth for several years to come. And as you know, we are seeing very strong growth on SkinnyPop. It provides us with resiliency and also flexibility just so that we can continue to support the strong growth that we are seeing. As you know, as you look across our business for strategic categories and businesses that we are in, we do like to have at least some degree of own manufacturing across our network.  And we also feel pretty good about the investment return at the investments that we made. We believe, given the quality of the assets, the fact that facilities are on the newer side that it is faster and cheaper than if we needed to build this on our own. \nKen Goldman : Thank you. \nMelissa Poole : Sure. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cody Ross with UBS. Please proceed with your question. \nCody Ross: Good morning. Thank you for taking our question. You're implementing a high-single-digit price increase on 50% of your confection portfolio effective at the end of May. I believe that's correct what you announced at the Analyst Day. How much do you believe will benefit fiscal \u201823 versus fiscal \u201824? And can you explain the mechanics of the benefit by the year? \nMichele Buck: Yeah, at the high level it's going to have, as we talked about in the Investor Conference more impact in \u201824 than it is in \u201923. That\u2019s based on partly the implementation date and then also the fact that we have protection in place for big promotions and programming for a good part of the year. And we're still working with retailers on the implementation.  And so, all of that will continue. I think, by the time we get to the mid-year mark, I have more visibility both on balance of \u201823 and \u201824 impacts that we\u2019ll be able to talk more about it at that time. \nCody Ross: Great. Thank you. And then, just a quick question on gross margin. Your gross margin came in higher than both yours and the street\u2019s expectation this quarter. You raised your outlook to expansion of 70 to 80 basis points for the year. What gives you confidence to raise your outlook this early in the year, especially in context of your retail Partners, who are struggling to expand gross margin this year based on their guidance? Thank you. \nMichele Buck: Yeah thank you. Yeah, it is early in the year I think, in general, we probably wouldn\u2019t look at raising our guidance top-line or bottom-line this earlier in the year. On the gross margin side, though, a couple of things, one, it\u2019s clearly we have some commodities that are getting more expensive than some cocoa and sugar in particular, are moving in the wrong direction that we have a few smaller non-test ingredients that are a little bit more favorable right now than they were. Time will tell whether that's going to be able to stick around.  But probably the biggest pieces than just freight and logistics improvements and if you recall last year at this time, when we did the call, that was one of the big, I'll say surprises on the downside was increasing and freight and logistics costs. And for the first quarter at least, we saw some improvement in that both on our supply chain but also contracted support for getting truck show up for appointments and freight costs and so forth.  So, those are really the drivers in the first quarter that we captured in the outlook. Time will tell as the year goes on how the rest plays out. But that's what gives us the confidence is really just the first quarter performance. \nCody Ross: Thank you very much. I\u2019ll pass it along. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nick Modi with RBC. Please proceed with your question. \nNick Modi: Yeah, thank you. Good morning everyone. So just a quick clarification. Hey, good morning. On international, I saw the comment you put in the prepared remarks. But maybe any more context on exactly some of the specific initiatives outside of a recovery in travel. I'm just curious, on there was a very strong number relative to expectations.  And then, if you could just touch on the market share commentary you made in the U.S., kind of what's driving some of that? You talked about the mix, but I was kind of unclear exactly what that was referencing. \nMelissa Poole : Yeah, I mean if we look at the initiatives in international, we've seen category strength across the markets. We saw a stronger Easter season in Brazil than we had anticipated. We continue to see distribution gains in Mexico and also in India. So, across the board some strength there. We do expect some moderation, going forward because we have some pretty strong laps. But our demand has really remained pretty, pretty resilient.  And then, we're also seeing some impacts from timing as if you may recall in Q4, consumer demand outpaced our shipments and we've recovered some of that in the first quarter. And can you repeat your share question one more time? \nNick Modi: Yeah, I was just, I was just hoping you could provide some context on the US share commentary you had in the prepared remarks and the press release? You had referenced I think in the prepared remarks, mix was a driver and I was just unclear. But if you could just provide any context on some of the market share trends that you are seeing? \nMelissa Poole : Yeah, absolutely. So, we definitely - if we look at Easter, we had some impacts from supply constraints. We anticipate by Halloween and holiday, those will be behind us. But that impact - impacted us. And then also, we've continued to see very strong growth in sweets and then also that rebound of refreshments from some of the weaker trends in that post-COVID type of the year. So really mix as an impact. \nNick Modi: Great. Thank you. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pamela Kaufman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. \nPamela Kaufman : Hi, good morning. \nMelissa Poole : Good morning. \nMichele Buck: Good morning. \nPamela Kaufman : I was hoping that you could talk kind of generally about what you're seeing in the consumer demand environment? You've seen strong volumes despite strong pricing growth. So how are you thinking about the consumer and elasticities over the course of the year? \nMelissa Poole : So, I'll start by talking a little bit about the trends and I\u2019ll let Steve talk about elasticities. Certainly consumer behavior continues to evolve and we know that many consumers have made changes to their spending to respond to inflation in the marketplace. We certainly continue to see that food has performed well compared to other categories, specifically food at home as it's a much more affordable option for consumers versus dining out. And we also know snacks and candy continue to perform even better than broader food and elasticities in those categories have continued to remain pretty strong. And we do expect that we'll continue to see strengthen in those elasticities.  We know the consumers are being increasingly mindful about where they shop. They are looking for more affordable options. Whether it is the channels in which they are shopping, whether its private-label, whether it is deals and increased promotion. And we are constantly carefully monitoring those trends, just to make sure that our media and our in-store activations are really optimized, so that we can align to the trends that we're seeing.  Steve, do you want to talk a little bit about elasticity - on the elasticity side? \nSteve Voskuil : We touched on this a little bit in the first question. We still expect elasticity to moderate as the year goes on, but in our outlook now a little bit less severely than we did in our original plan. And we'll see how the year plays out. But that's our current assumption. \nPamela Kaufman : Okay, thank you. And my second question is just on the ERP implementation within snacks. Can you touch on what benefits you expect to realize from it? And what impact is factored into your guidance for this year from the ERP implementation? \nSteve Voskuil : Sure. So, we have, we have the impact of the transition on the ERP baked into the guidance. We profiled that out across the quarters including some inventory build in advance of the changeover and then the changeover itself in the back half of the year. In terms of benefits, it's a critical ingredient to driving efficient scale across that businesses.  We touched on that a bit in our investor conferences. Well, one of our goal is to drive scale efficiency on all parts of that business on the front-end, the supply chain side, and so forth. And this system is important to get them on the same system. The rest of the company will operate on, so we can operate the back office efficiently. We can operate the front-end efficiently, have more inventory visibility that are planning capabilities. And so, so it is the integral. We are excited about it. Everything to-date is on track and we'll look forward to getting that behind us later this year. \nMelissa Poole : And Pam, I think we did on the last call. We might called out the impact. It's about a half a point headwind for us for the full year related to that transition all focused in the fourth quarter results. \nPamela Kaufman : Right. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question. \nDavid Palmer : Thanks. Good morning. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned \u2013 good morning - you mentioned that you'll be in a strong position to fully support consumer demand for the rest of \u201823. I wonder if you could give some color about that. It's obviously ahead of some of that 5% increase in production that you're expecting to add.  So, is that the COVID era issues with labor constraints in your supply chain? Is that the upstream suppliers coming through? And I have a quick follow-up. \nMelissa Poole : Yeah, I mean, I would say, the recovery that we anticipate is really driven by the increasing Investments that we've continued to make over the past several years in capacity. Obviously, some of them take some time to be able to get equipment, get it up and running et cetera. And so, that's the point at which we believe we start to get ahead. So, I think we've pretty consistently talked about and end of \u201823 and \u201824, that we anticipate being beyond many of these supply issues.  But yes, I would It's a predominantly, they've been focused on capacity. Certainly, in the early years there were some other industry dynamics, as well. It's even - I'm not sure maybe your question, the 5%, just to clarify, that is actually that the pound number not a sales number. I mean, we were clear enough in the remark.  So that that 5% growth in production pounds will be well ahead of what the guidance calls for volume and that's kind of how we catch up. \nDavid Palmer : Got it. And in that capacity that you're ramping up with the three new Reese's plants and the one new Hershey plant, will that be more than the 5% into \u201824? Because it's ramping through the year. I am wondering what's the impact of capacity increases for 2024 do you think? \nMelissa Poole : There will be a carryover into \u201824 from those, as well as some additional capacity expansions that we have coming online. So there will be a low-single-digit increase in pounds production available next year as well from carryover and some new initiatives. \nDavid Palmer : Thank you very much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question. \nMax Gumport: Hey, thanks for the question. I was hoping you could give us an update on what you're seeing with regard to the retailer pricing environment. It feels like we're seeing more headlines in the media talking about retailers pushing back to physically again packaged food manufacturers, but we're continuing to see companies like yourself getting strong pricing through in quarterly results.  So just hoping you can give us some color on this debate that seems to be emerging. Thanks. \nMelissa Poole : So we always partner very closely with our retail customers to try and do what we believe is best to meet consumer demand and also to drive category growth, which is good for both of us. So we continue to have very collaborative discussions with our retailers relative to our pricing implementations, which also includes a lot of discussion about with the right plans to have business reinvestment that will enable the support of very strong unit conversion. \nMax Gumport: Thanks and one follow-up on gross margin. I realized \u2013in the year and that taking up guidance is a bit unusual and it speaks to the confidence you have in your outlook. But one question I'm getting is that, if we look at your gross margin results in the first quarter and think about what your guidance implies for the remainder of the year, it seems like it would imply some sequential step down in the gross margins through the year even after taking into account some seasonality. And so, I'm just curious what type of factors might be going into into those assumptions there? Thanks. \nSteve Voskuil : Yeah, the big \u2013 I think the biggest factor is it is still early in the year. We still have a lot to play out and so we're certainly taking stock of the upsides that we saw in the first quarter. But we're still being cautious also on what is to come in or the world has changed a lot over these quarters there is still a lot of volatility potentially ahead. And so, we're factoring that. And then also, as we go forward, particularly in Q4 the laps get tougher. And so, that's the other factor weighing in the guidance. \nMax Gumport: Thanks very much. \nSteve Voskuil : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. \nBryan Spillane : Hey, thanks operator. Good morning, everybody. I just wanted to ask a question about seasonal, you talked about the, - what part of what impacted market share on seasonals in the first quarter was capacity constraints. And I think, right, we've talked about more capacity available for seasonals as we move through the year. So if can you just kind of talk about that and how that sets up for especially the fall or the third and fourth quarter? And whether you feel like you'll be adequately supplied with seasonal products there? \nMelissa Poole : Yeah, sure. So, absolutely. We believe that with the additional supply that we have ramping up as we go through the year, that we will be in good shape to have a very solid plan to meet Halloween and holiday demand. So, some of the issues that we encounter during Easter we should be passed in the back half. \nBryan Spillane : Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question. \nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning. In the press release, you had mentioned just the ability to sustain momentum into 2024 and beyond, obviously it's early. But just kind of caught my eye that you would call that out, what are you seeing at that would you drive a reference that come up that far ahead and how much color can you give on how you're thinking about 2024 right now? \nMelissa Poole : I mean we're not going to give a lot of \u2013 we are not really going to talk about 2024. I mean, at the very high level I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the consumer piece and Steve can talk about the P&L component. But we feel good about the momentum that we're seeing on the business, certainly in terms of consumers\u2019 engagement with the category.  A lot of the underlying consumer behaviors that we're seeing sustain which continue to support performance. We're continuing to see good response to the investments that we\u2019re making in media behind the business across all parts, really. I mean CMG, as well as our salty brands where we're just getting started on some of the investments in salty.  And certainly, as we saw in the first quarter, strong momentum in international. So right now, we don't see any big signals that suggest to us any big hurdles on the top-line. \nSteve Voskuil : Yeah, I would agree. I just point to, as Michelle said, capacity \u2013 having capacity available as we exit the year to be a little bit more on the gaps from that standpoint versus some of the limits we've had in the last couple of years the salty aspirations that we have talked a lot about that at the conference coming off of the back of the ERP and rolling into next year, we're excited about that.  And then the commercial capabilities that we talked more about at the conference, as well that being able to help drive sustainable growth in the US business in particular. So, those are just some of the reasons that it we feel pretty good about the momentum. \nMichael Lavery: No, that's helpful color. Thank you. And just a follow-up on that, we got see the \u2013 at the Investor Day obviously and just curious, if you have a sense of how big a lift do you think that can drive and maybe specifically at least what's factored into your thinking and guidance around that. And just sort of we've already seen obviously a very strong momentum there. How much further can it go? And then what - how you think about your expectations? \nMelissa Poole : You know, I would say it's too early. We've just started the support on air. We feel very good about all the work that we've done in terms of understanding the dots consumer and the consumers\u2019 relationship with dots. And so we feel good about the messaging direction, the creative execution and certainly it's scored incredibly well and the responsiveness that we tend to see across our snacking categories with advertising investments.  So more to come and we'll share more as we have actual in-market results on that. But we think that will clearly only help us given that we haven't been investing in that brand in the past. \nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great, thanks so much. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. \nRob Dickerson: All right, great. Thanks so much. Two kind of easy questions. The first is just in international, obviously impressive on the volume side, but really don\u2019t see any incremental pricing year-over-year. So I am just curious let me clearly it's intentional just kind of curious as to why that's intentional why we're not seeing much pricing in international that\u2019s kind of given the cost complex and kind of what you've been able to push through in the US? And then I have a quick follow-up. \nSteve Voskuil : Sure, we are pursuing a price strategy in international. It's just more modest of what we're seeing so far. And it\u2019s offset by some of the other laps that we had in the quarter. They are having some impact on how much of that price is coming through, but we should see more price come through in the next three quarters. \nRob Dickerson: Okay, fair enough. And then, just quickly back to you Steve too, buying the incremental popcorn facilities, which I get, but clearly not that much cash out lay - cash outlay for those facilities and if we think - kind of think about where the top-line probably headed into \u201824 and CapEx gets a little bit better next year markets been decent, there should be a step up in free cash flow while the balance sheet is strong. So, and I know you kind of always reiterate kind of your standard issue capital deployment priorities.  But would you say kind of at this point given all the CapEx that's being spent on the on the new facilities or the new lines and then the recent - the acquisition of the new popcorn facilities they kind of broadly speaking you feel like you're probably in a pretty good spot in terms of kind of what you need to grow. And therefore it is there a possibility for, let's say you know other cash deployment whether being around the dividend or buyback the what have you? Thanks \nSteve Voskuil : Sure. Yeah, great question. So we \u2013 we do - the short answer is, yeah, we do feel good with that additional capacity in place or coming in place for the Weaver acquisition will be very helpful to support the growth of that business for a time to come. And I also like the fact that, we're buying well-maintained state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. What we're not doing that is still much more capital efficient than building from whole cloth.  And so, it is capital efficient to pick up assets this way, as well. So, as we look to the future, I feel good about the capacity that we're going to have installed on both the confection business and the salty business. And that will have an impact on free cash flow as we look to the future. \nRob Dickerson: Alright. Fair enough. Thank you. \nSteve Voskuil : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Feeney with Consumer Edge. Please proceed with your question. \nJonathan Feeney: Thanks very much. Could you comment on the role of fate, not just recent distribution growth, but distribution growth over the last 12 to 18 months in the salty snack business driving at really outsized volume growth?  Because, I guess, I'm trying to understand how when you take these products whether it's dots most recently or others into new markets, is there a necessary to care like, you have all this great innovation into Hershey capabilities and then that kind of seasons and it slows down. What data or insight can you offer to help us understand that and may be if you think about what a sustainable organic volume growth looks like for salty snack going forward? Thanks. \nMelissa Poole : Yes, absolutely. So, clearly distribution is job one, when we buy a business like this. I mean, that's one of our key strengths and we want to fully utilize it. So on dots in particular, there were really opportunities to kind of fill in on distribution. Previously, they really didn't have a very large Walmart business and they were underdeveloped in the northeast.  So that's been a big area of focus and that certainly has driven - has been a key driver of the business. But we've also seen increases in velocity at the same time, given the very strong repeat potential that we see from consumers behind this product. Then as you think about the growth trajectory, over time, I would kind of describe it as it basically will evolve in terms of what the drivers are.  So as we fill out the distribution, we start to really employ our category management capability relative to optimizing the shelf. As you saw in March, we then start to apply our media capability with advertising behind the brand to really increase awareness and household penetration. And then beyond that, the other kind of key focus is relative to price pack architecture and other drivers.  So, I think we will see the revenue coming from it will continue, but we will apply the other capabilities we have to really generate that. And as we mentioned at Investor Day, we do anticipate seeing growth in that 15% kind of range for the next few years. And then, but a deceleration from the twenty plus percent that we've seen more recently. \nJonathan Feeney: Thank you very much. Much. \nSteve Voskuil : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Mizuho Securities USA. Please proceed with your question. \nJohn Baumgartner : Good morning. Thanks for the question. \nSteve Voskuil : Good morning. \nJohn Baumgartner : Maybe just building on John's question, Michelle sticking with the salty snacks distribution. And another focus here is building availability in mass and grocery, but the ACV opportunity seems pretty significant in C stores, as well.  Are there any considerations whether it's dislodging competitors or, the routes to market that you \u2013 in the DSD model given the velocities that didn\u2019t makes the path to building ACV in C stores a bit slower for these categories. Just you how are you thinking about closing that distribution gap in C stores over time? Thank you. \nMelissa Poole : Well, C store is really a core capability for the company for our base core CMG businesses. Certainly we realize its importance in reaching certain specific consumers and really certain specific occasions when consumers are out and about. So it is a priority for us. We have been focused on that. I think in SkinnyPop, we are certainly making progress. But there's more opportunity to go.  And so, it'll remain a focus for us going forward. I don't know if I'd say that there is any key barrier. Certainly, there are folks who have DSD capability more broadly. But we've done a good job with our CMG business, where we don't have it building distribution in convenience stores. So, we feel very good about that.  And then across our salty snacks network, we do have both warehouse and DSD capability. And we're really working right now to optimize how we best utilize each to maximize the potential of the business. \nJohn Baumgartner : Okay. And then in terms of the popcorn assets that you're acquiring, in addition to just the pure growth in volume capacity, is there anything augment your capabilities whether it\u2019s pack size or anything else in terms of opportunity there? \nMichele Buck : Yeah, and beyond just the capacity and one of the things that gives us the opportunity to optimize the supply chain network more, broadly. So if you think to the future, other assets are potentially coming in, if you think about some of the strategies we talked about around price pack architecture, and being able to make sure we have the right packs and mixes to support the business going forward. So by having all of that in our hands, in our control, just gives us more flexibility and agility to deliver that growth plan. \nMelissa Poole : Yeah. And as I mentioned earlier, we do have that gives capacity ahead of demand. So it gives us that trajectory for the next few years. \nJohn Baumgartner : Thanks Michelle. Thanks Steve. \nMichele Buck : Thank you. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason English with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. \nJason English: Hey, good morning, folks. \nMelissa Poole : Good morning. \nJason English: A couple quick questions. So, Colgate just recently did something similar in past we would think going out and buying some capacity. When that came into the floor, there was lot of other products to do making it created some margins torsion near term. Is there anything to be aware of like a similar on that front with the Weaver acquisition? \nMelissa Poole : No, I mean, bulk of the capacity is ready to eat popcorn. So it didn't really come with a big negative overhang. \nMichele Buck : That's right. \nMelissa Poole : Other than that there will be excess unused capacity for a while, so that there's some fixed overhead there. \nSteve Voskuil : Yeah. Some fixed overhead and some transition cost that would be normal. But not a portfolio overhang like you're referencing, Jason. \nJason English: Good to know. Thanks for that. And then, bigger picture question, You've got \u2013 as you mentioned elasticity has been very low. That's not a Hershey comment or even a confection comment, the industry comment because we have a lot of cross price left, if you ever moving the same direction, it sounds like in \u201824 you\u2019re kind of have to kind of break from the past and push through quite a quite a bit of pricing that it\u2019s by where, we're not expecting a lot from the industry at large.  So, how are you managing this cross price elasticities? Which category should we be watching? And where you tend to see switching between confection? And I'll leave it there. \nSteve Voskuil : Yeah, I would say, first of all, it's a little early yet to be starting to think about the cross elasticity for \u201924. You\u2019re right. We're trying to think ahead in terms of the pricing strategy. We're also watching the commodity space like we talked about earlier and some of the upward movements on cocoa and sugar. And so, I think that's getting us in a good starting position. But then what happens to the other categories and peers is all yet to be seen.  And we will be able to communicate more on that, obviously as you probably turn the corner and get to the back half. But Melissa do you want to add? \nMelissa Poole : Yeah, that's the one piece I might add is just, ours is a kind of come through a little bit slower and more elongated because of the timing it takes for us to implement particularly with seasons. So, kind of, as we think about \u201824 pricing, we won't have an outsized price gap versus kind of pre-pandemic levels versus a lot of our competition.  As you see many of them are posting high teens or 20% pricing versus up at 10%. So some of those just ours is a little bit more spread out. But we will certainly be watching it very closely and particularly within, snacking to look at where the share of stomach is going and how those cross elasticities progress. \nJason English: Yeah, that's a good point. Thanks a lot. I\u2019ll pass it on. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question. \nChris Carey: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. I just have a question on confection margins. Very strong in the quarter even despite a tough year ago compare, pricing is clearly building. How should we be thinking about confection margins not just this year, but certainly over time, as it seems like we're coming through very strongly with pricing and cost perhaps are easing. And so, again just your trajectory of confection margins would be helpful. And I think you had mentioned some inflation in cocoa and sugar, just remind us of your duration on those hedges and when we might be seeing that inflation coming through and just so we can kind of assess when the pricing might be needed to offset it? Thanks so much. \nSteve Voskuil : Sure, I'll take the last piece first. Just on cocoa and sugar we don't get specific on the duration of our hedging programs. Obviously, for those two commodities we do some hedging. But we don't share the duration. We do expect to see potentially more impact in \u201824 than \u201823. But we'll see how the markets play out.  On pricing and just more generally as we talked about the investor conference, our goal is always have a mix of volume and price. That's part of the balance in our growth formula and as part of that we also want to see margin accretion over time for both sources. And so, confection margins have been strong, but even in the future, across All levers, pricing, including price pack, architecture and mix, and other things, we want to continue to put upward pressure on our margins because that's part of our growth formulas so. \nMelissa Poole : And we continue to see some of our inputs rise, cocoa and sugar recently which is one of the reasons that we decided to lean into that more recent pricing action. \nSteve Voskuil : That\u2019s right.\nChris Carey: Okay, that's it for me. Thanks so much. \nSteve Voskuil : Thank you. \nOperator: We have reached the end of the question and answer session. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Melissa Poole for closing remarks. \nMelissa Poole: Yes. Thanks so much for joining us this morning and all the great questions and the continued interest and investment in our company. So I'll be available today and in the coming weeks to answer any additional follow-ups you may have. Thanks so much. Have a great day. \nOperator: And this concludes today's conference and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "content": "We touched on this a little bit in the first question. We still expect elasticity to moderate as the year goes on, but in our outlook now a little bit less severely than we did in our original plan. And we'll see how the year plays out. But that's our current assumption. Sure. So, we have, we have the impact of the transition on the ERP baked into the guidance. We profiled that out across the quarters including some inventory build in advance of the changeover and then the changeover itself in the back half of the year. In terms of benefits, it's a critical ingredient to driving efficient scale across that businesses.  We touched on that a bit in our investor conferences. Well, one of our goal is to drive scale efficiency on all parts of that business on the front-end, the supply chain side, and so forth. And this system is important to get them on the same system. The rest of the company will operate on, so we can operate the back office efficiently. We can operate the front-end efficiently, have more inventory visibility that are planning capabilities. And so, so it is the integral. We are excited about it. Everything to-date is on track and we'll look forward to getting that behind us later this year. Yeah, the big \u2013 I think the biggest factor is it is still early in the year. We still have a lot to play out and so we're certainly taking stock of the upsides that we saw in the first quarter. But we're still being cautious also on what is to come in or the world has changed a lot over these quarters there is still a lot of volatility potentially ahead. And so, we're factoring that. And then also, as we go forward, particularly in Q4 the laps get tougher. And so, that's the other factor weighing in the guidance. Thank you. Yeah, I would agree. I just point to, as Michelle said, capacity \u2013 having capacity available as we exit the year to be a little bit more on the gaps from that standpoint versus some of the limits we've had in the last couple of years the salty aspirations that we have talked a lot about that at the conference coming off of the back of the ERP and rolling into next year, we're excited about that.  And then the commercial capabilities that we talked more about at the conference, as well that being able to help drive sustainable growth in the US business in particular. So, those are just some of the reasons that it we feel pretty good about the momentum. Sure, we are pursuing a price strategy in international. It's just more modest of what we're seeing so far. And it's offset by some of the other laps that we had in the quarter. They are having some impact on how much of that price is coming through, but we should see more price come through in the next three quarters. Sure. Yeah, great question. So we \u2013 we do - the short answer is, yeah, we do feel good with that additional capacity in place or coming in place for the Weaver acquisition will be very helpful to support the growth of that business for a time to come. And I also like the fact that, we're buying well-maintained state-of-the-art manufacturing facility. What we're not doing that is still much more capital efficient than building from whole cloth.  And so, it is capital efficient to pick up assets this way, as well. So, as we look to the future, I feel good about the capacity that we're going to have installed on both the confection business and the salty business. And that will have an impact on free cash flow as we look to the future. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning. Yeah. Some fixed overhead and some transition cost that would be normal. But not a portfolio overhang like you're referencing, Jason. Yeah, I would say, first of all, it's a little early yet to be starting to think about the cross elasticity for '24. You're right. We're trying to think ahead in terms of the pricing strategy. We're also watching the commodity space like we talked about earlier and some of the upward movements on cocoa and sugar. And so, I think that's getting us in a good starting position. But then what happens to the other categories and peers is all yet to be seen.  And we will be able to communicate more on that, obviously as you probably turn the corner and get to the back half. But Melissa do you want to add? Sure, I'll take the last piece first.

And so, confection margins have been strong, but even in the future, across All levers, pricing, including price pack, architecture and mix, and other things, we want to continue to put upward pressure on our margins because that's part of our growth formulas so.

            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Good morning. Yeah, thank you, Andrew. Yeah, you're exactly right. For the first quarter, the timing impact was about half of the - half the beat on the sales line and also strong performance in international. So those were the two big drivers and we look to the balance of year. Obviously, the timing is going to wash out in the second quarter, but we do expect to see a little bit better elasticities in the year to go period. We still see a moderating versus some of the strong performance we've seen the last six to nine months.  But a little bit more improvement and we're spaced that a little bit more on media investment that we also have incrementally in the year to go plan. So between, I would say, with the strength we saw in the international business, what we're seeing on the back of improved elasticities a little bit in the year to go period, that's what gives us the confidence in the race, right? Yeah, 2Q will be probably our most challenging quarter. I look to the balance of the year. We're going to have the timing piece shift back out, but then also recall last year it was a big inventory till quarter as well. And so, when you look at the laps, it's pretty tough lap. That combined with that point and a half coming out, we'll put, more to the mid-single digit range, probably from a sales standpoint. And that will put more pressure on the EPS side than the rest of the quarters. Yeah, at the high level it's going to have, as we talked about in the Investor Conference more impact in \u201824 than it is in '23. That's based on partly the implementation date and then also the fact that we have protection in place for big promotions and programming for a good part of the year. And we're still working with retailers on the implementation.  And so, all of that will continue. I think, by the time we get to the mid-year mark, I have more visibility both on balance of \u201823 and \u201824 impacts that we'll be able to talk more about it at that time. Yeah thank you. Yeah, it is early in the year I think, in general, we probably wouldn't look at raising our guidance top-line or bottom-line this earlier in the year. On the gross margin side, though, a couple of things, one, it's clearly we have some commodities that are getting more expensive than some cocoa and sugar in particular, are moving in the wrong direction that we have a few smaller non-test ingredients that are a little bit more favorable right now than they were. Time will tell whether that's going to be able to stick around.  But probably the biggest pieces than just freight and logistics improvements and if you recall last year at this time, when we did the call, that was one of the big, I'll say surprises on the downside was increasing and freight and logistics costs. And for the first quarter at least, we saw some improvement in that both on our supply chain but also contracted support for getting truck show up for appointments and freight costs and so forth.  So, those are really the drivers in the first quarter that we captured in the outlook. Time will tell as the year goes on how the rest plays out. But that's what gives us the confidence is really just the first quarter performance. Good morning. Yeah, and beyond just the capacity and one of the things that gives us the opportunity to optimize the supply chain network more, broadly. So if you think to the future, other assets are potentially coming in, if you think about some of the strategies we talked about around price pack architecture, and being able to make sure we have the right packs and mixes to support the business going forward. So by having all of that in our hands, in our control, just gives us more flexibility and agility to deliver that growth plan. Thank you. That's right."

A question-and-answer session will follow. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Anoori Naughton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.\nAnoori Naughton: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for Hershey Company's third quarter 2024 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to the prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the prerecorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session, we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call.

These statements, including expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC fillings.

With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi, good morning and thank you. I wanted to ask a couple of questions around the comment regarding top line being roughly on Algo for next year. The first question is Street is looking for a pretty decent step-up in your realized price for next year. I wanted to make sure that's the right way to think it? And then the second question is, is it reasonable for us to assume that your guidance will factor typical or historical one-for-one elasticity on certain products that you've mentioned in the past? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Steve, do you want to take that?\nSteven Voskuil: Sure. On the reference to the algorithm, we're talking about our long-term algorithm. So that's two to four on the top. So that's the reference point that we're looking to. In terms of realized price, all-in, we'd expect pricing next year to year to look a lot like this year. As the price increases, we took this flow through. Obviously, we'll work to make sure we're competitive. And work with retailers to make sure we get good execution of that. And then from an elasticity standpoint, we expect historical elasticity, which is what we've seen as we progressed further through this year.\nKen Goldman: Got it. I\u2019ll pass it on. Thank you.\nSteven Voskuil: You bet. Thanks, Ken.\nMichele Buck: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks. Good morning, Michele and Steve.\nMichele Buck: Good morning\nSteven Voskuil: Hi, Andrew.\nAndrew Lazar: I guess, I want to put all things cocoa sort of aside for the moment and focus again on core underlying trends. What would you expect core, I guess, chocolate market share trends to look like as you exit this year? Can market share get back to stable? Or do you think it takes maybe more into the first half of next year? And what should we be looking for in the data, I guess, as we move through the fourth quarter? And I ask because, obviously, if we're supposed to be looking through the anomalous cocoa cost inflation in '25 to potentially a year of maybe outsized growth in '26 as costs normalize. It's really this underlying share trends that obviously are most important. And in core chocolate, we're going on, I think, like 2 years of some share weakness. So that's really what I'm trying to get at. Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Absolutely. Thanks, Andrew. Yes, let me step back and talk a little bit about category and market share trends. So first of all, we continue to feel really good about the category resiliency that we've seen consistently growing about -- around that 2% range, which is what it's been historically and continuing to outpace other snack categories. So we think that's a really good starting point for us. We do see us ending the year with greater momentum than we have had particularly if we look at some of the green shoots that we called out in the script relative to sweets and the acceleration that, that innovation that we launched in the marketplace is really taking hold, driving takeaway and also increasing share with each 4-week period that goes by, we had a great Halloween and expect that we will have one share in Halloween. SkinnyPop, certainly, we called for a reversal in trend. We've seen that in the past 4 weeks. Innovation remains strong. And then we have a few labs that we are starting to get into that period that lessens the pressure that we're facing. We had spoken before about reductions in merge the key retailers. Last 12 weeks, we've seen over 2% growth there. So, as we look forward, we feel good about a lot of those things, combined with as we get into next year, a longer Easter other headwinds that are bit less relative to SNAP, Mexico drinks and some of the retailer inventory issues. So, I would say it's going to be, I would say, a gradual improvement that we do think will build both in terms of dollars and percent. And probably the piece of the portfolio that will remain under pressure will be instant consumable because convenience stores, we really saw some of the pressure in that channel start midyear. So we think it will take us through the first half to get through that. The other pieces of the portfolio we're expecting to continue to see recovery.\nAndrew Lazar: Got it. Thank you. And then real quick, just a new head of North America Confectionery. And maybe just a little bit about what you see him bringing to the table and where strategy could well change or is it more a continuation with just more sort of energy around it. Just trying to get a better sense for that. Thanks so much.\nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. So obviously, Mike is a really strong exec coming to us from PepsiCo. Several things that I think he will bring, number one, always appreciate external perspective and always a good chance to relook what we're doing well, where we can continue to be better. Secondly, he has a very deep and rich background of being incredibly close to customers and retail. And I think that he will significantly that up even further as we go forward into the future to unlock new growth and continue to evolve our portfolio to those channels where consumers are migrating to.\nAndrew Lazar: Thanks so much.\nMichele Buck: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Galbo with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nPeter Galbo : Hey, Michele, Steve, good morning. Thanks for taking the question.\nSteve Voskuil : Good morning.\nMichele Buck : Good morning.\nPeter Galbo : Steve, in your prepared remarks, you did give a bit of insight on 2025 inflation and that rate expecting to be more of a headwind versus what it was in 2024. But just wondering if you could elaborate. I think your guidance for this year is high single-digit COGS inflation. And so when we think about more for next year, is that a low double-digit number, low teens, mid-teens? Just anything else more you can give us to kind of help as we think about modeling.\nSteve Voskuil : Yes. Not surprising me the biggest piece is going to be Cocoa. And the year-over-year move will be significant. You look at the rates that we've been paying for Cocoa this year, we set that back when we set our guidance in February. And so said back then, we're well hedged for 2024. So the cocoa prices we've been paying this year reflect getting into the market really from earlier this year in preceding. So now you flash ahead to current pricing and you look at pricing for next year, it's a pretty significant step up. And it's not just the cocoa side. The cocoa beans of course, the biggest piece, but there's also cocoa butter, coco liquor and some of the other physical derivatives of cocoa that will be inside that inflation. And so we'll get into a lot more detail on that when we come back in the fourth quarter. But that will be the biggest source of inflation clearly. I expect we'll see some labor inflation that we'll probably see some other inflation in specialty ingredients and things like that. And alongside that, we'll be talking about our plans for productivity and so forth to chip away at some of that inflation, but cocoa and sugar probably are going to be the two biggest pieces.\nPeter Galbo: Got it. Okay. No, that's helpful. We'll wait for February for more detail there. And then if I can just ask on the gross margin actually in the quarter. It seemed like it maybe came in below not only just Street, but maybe your own internal expectations. And -- just kind of what drove the variance? Is the deleverage piece from volume more than you expected? Is it more mix? Just can help us understand what happened there? Thanks so much.\nSteve Voskuil : Sure. It was below what we were expecting just as we said we're disappointed on the top line, disappointed by the margin performance as well. The biggest piece was the sales flow through and in fact, the sales were down and then the mix of sales, we talked about C-store, for example. So there was some negative mix inside the sales delivery that had an impact on gross margin. And then as you mentioned, we also had some volume deleverage when we have that big of an impact in the quarter. So between the sales flow through the mix and the deleverage, those are really the biggest pieces that drove that disappointment.\nPeter Galbo: Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nMichele Buck : Alexia?\nAlexia Howard: Hi, there. Can you hear me okay?\nMichele Buck : Now we can. Yes.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. Perfect. Can you bring up the topic of the GLP-1 drugs? There seem to be a few data sources now. Obviously, it's early days that are suggesting that maybe mid single-digit percentage of U.S. adults absolutely higher are currently using these. That was a little faster than we expected them to be adopted this time last year. Can I ask how you're going about exploring what these patients need? How to respond to that whether you're seeing any impact on the chocolate sales at the moment and what the path forward is on that? And then I have a follow-up.\nMichele Buck: Yes. So we would say we're seeing a mild year-on-year impact, I'd say, consistent with what I think we've shared before in line with what we would expect, which I would say is more a gradual impact. We've continued to see multiple sources of data validating that the consumers on those drugs are eating disproportionately less our categories. I know there's been some mix data, but we've seen a lot on that. So it's in line with what we expect, and we are carefully monitoring that behavior, how it's evolving and certainly understanding what the needs are of those consumers so that as we continue to evolve our portfolio, which we're always doing over time, that are evolving it in a way to make sure that we have the right offerings for those consumers as well.\nAlexia Howard: Many thanks. And then a quick follow-up. You mentioned an increase in competitive activity in the international segment from global competitors confectionary. Can you elaborate on that? Is that pricing competition? Or is there something else going on? Thank you. And I'll pass it on.\nMichele Buck: Yes. A lot of it has been pricing competition where certain competitors have chosen to really deal back somewhat deeply on price point. And that's in some of the markets where we tend to be a smaller player. Yes, and it's a smaller market for us, but it's been intense in those markets where it has occurred.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. We've had pockets of strength. The UK, Europe winning with Reese's, and I think we're really pleased with the progress, but particularly in Mexico and Brazil, we've seen higher levels of competition, some of which has been price related.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I will pass it on.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi. I guess two questions. I don't think I heard you, Michelle, if you felt like 2026 can be an above algo year. I know a competitor of yours is really calling that out based on what they think cocoa costs will do. So maybe you can give more specifics on how you think that works? And then I also wanted to make sure I understand the comment from Steve on pricing. I think you said it's going to look a lot like pricing in 2025 will look like 2024, but you have a high single-digit price increase on chocolate. So if it looks like before that just looks lower than what I would expect. So maybe I'm wrong there. But can you give more clarity?\nMichele Buck: Yes. So I'll hit the 2026. So we do feel good that can be on algorithm if cocoa is stable and if cocoa prices really declined, there could be some outsized growth possible, certainly. So we're watching the cocoa price carefully, but we are feeling good based on what we believe and see that we would be on algorithm or have some upside.\nSteve Voskuil: And on the pricing side, I think the piece is we've taken pricing on about half of our chocolate pounds. And so when you factor that in, it ends up netting out to low mid single-digit pricing in total. And that's why I say it's largely similar to what we saw this year.\nRobert Moskow: Okay. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Thanks, Rob.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your questions.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: Just wanted to understand how you're thinking about marketing spending. Your advertising spending was down slightly, but of course, so were sales. And it wasn't down quite as much as sales. So -- on a percent basis, obviously, even in this quarter, that's held up. But you've obviously got a cost-pressured environment is marketing, one of the ways you can have some flexibility with the bottom line? Or how do you think about just protecting that or really trying to protect share as well given the price increases?\nMichele Buck: I'll share some thoughts and I'll ask Steve to as well. So clearly, we continue to believe in the importance of investing in our brands. We think that's also really important in an environment where prices are where they are. That said, we have really good marketing mix models. We continually look at generating higher ROIs each year. We hold ourselves to that standard. We are also always looking at things like new media agency RFPs that can drive meaningful productivity. We do have that as we approach 2025. So we're trying to be very thoughtful about investing where we think it makes sense. Strategically, there's an area next year that we really want to focus on in terms of incremental investment in our variety brands to really bolster the instant consumable business. Steve, other things you want to add there?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, I would just say Q3, we index a little bit to sales on the way media hits P&L. So there's some impact there. No pullback in terms of supporting our brands. And as we look to next year, our top priorities are going to be driving top line, driving share, driving consumption and we're going to leverage media as one [indiscernible]. And that's not to say we don't want efficiency. As Michele said, we're looking to new agency that will drive some efficiency. We're bringing new tools to bear to make sure that we're allocating that money wisely, but we're absolutely not pulling back.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. And then just a follow-up on your inventory comments at tighter inventories you had called out as impacting the outlook. Coming into the quarter, you had pointed to a second half inventory restocking that would have been fourth you skewed, I believe, even maybe kind of a four or five-point lift in lease confections in 4Q. I don't know how specific you can be, but it sounds like that's not coming through as expected. Can you just give us a sense of maybe how much of the guidance cut is from an inventory reset that isn't materializing the way you had initially expected?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yes, we still expect in the fourth quarter to see a mid-single digit. If I kind of say all shipping timing impacts, it's still going to be pretty significant in the fourth quarter. If I take a look at full year guidance, the impact of all of these inventory moves is probably about a 0.5 point drag on the adjustment that we made. Just to give some perspective. And I think we acknowledge this is a noisy quarter with lots of -- between lapping S4 in the case of ALD [ph] and timing and the way retailers have laid out seasons have lots of factors. So -- but when you look across all of it, the biggest piece is 0.5 point. We expect to see less of that all in 2025. It should be a lot cleaner conversation.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Palmer with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Palmer: Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nTom Palmer: I know it's still early for a full 2025 outlook. But I wanted to just get maybe more specific on a couple of items you noted for 2025. Just any help on the incentive comp, how much that's tracking below this year? And then second, you have multiyear plans for productivity and cost savings you've laid out. To what extent might you be able to flex these a bit higher in 2025 versus what the plan was for 2024?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. Sure. We can take that. The comp reset, we'll talk more about that when we get to the fourth quarter. So we're still -- excuse when we talk about fourth earnings, we're still working through this year. But obviously, with the performance this year, you can imagine the incentive comp is going to be -- need to be reset next year back to target levels. And again, we'll give more color on that. But it's a meaningful year-over-year impact. On the productivity, absolutely. We have a great history of driving productivity here before. We talked about things like the AAA program, which are incremental, just our base level of CI is something we try to push up every year. The teams are working hard to do that to continue that trajectory. And then we'll continue to look even within the bounds of the AAA program, what more can we do to help offset some of the inflation. I'd say it's going to be tough. The teams are working on it. The savings that we share as a net savings, so it takes into account some level of reinvestment. But we will definitely be looking to drive as much savings as we can for next year.\nTom Palmer: Right. Thanks for that color. Just a quick one on cocoa. The prepared remarks indicated, it would be inflationary throughout the year. Are there periods we should be thinking about next year where we will see that rate of inflation more significant than others?\nSteve Voskuil: Yes, I would say that's hard to call right now, just because we're still getting through this year and cocoa has been so volatile. We'll try to give more of that color when we do talk about full guidance for next year to give a little bit of prospect fact. By then, we'll have a pretty good picture price some of those year-over-year movements.\nTom Palmer: Okay. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nMax Gumport: Hi. Thanks for the question. Just going back to cost savings for next year. It feels like what we know now, there could be $140 million or so coming from the productivity program benefiting COGS, and then maybe $40 million or so benefiting COGS in the AAA program, so call it $180 in total. One, do I have that right? And then two, your remarks about it being your teams are working, but it will be tough to get after those savings. Are there incremental savings above and beyond those two buckets? Or should we really be thinking about $180 million or so being the number for 2025? Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil: Yes. I don't want to give -- pin down exactly how that's going to allocate. The $130 million to $140 million in CI is typically targeted at the operating supply chain area. So I'll say, tick the box correct on that. We'll give more details on the split of AAA when we give our guidance for the fourth quarter. It's a mix, as we talked about before, there is clearly a COGS component, and there's a pretty significant SG&A corporate expense component as well, and we'll give more detail on that breakout when we get there. And what was the second question you had? Was that it?\nMax Gumport: That was really -- that was helpful.\nSteve Voskuil: Okay, fine.\nMax Gumport: But I will ask a second question, which is on -- going back to Alexia's question on GLP-1. And I think you talked about seeing a mild impact. Really I'm curious if you could put a finer point on what type of impact you're actually seeing. And then, related to that is, I think we're all of the mind that much of the snappiness we're seeing right now is due to the consumer feeling financial pressure which you talked about in your prepared remarks. But I'm curious if think there is a meaningful portion of the snacking weakness right now that is due to category level shifts related to GLP-1, particularly as we see some of these higher protein categories even within snacking, such as meat snacks doing better than others? Thanks. I'll leave it there.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. All the analysis that we have done has continued to show that the year-on-year impact is not significant and that the pressure in the snacking categories are really driven by the consumers feeling pressured financially. So, every piece of data that we've seen has really indicated that. And then, of course, on some elements of our business, some opportunities for us to be executing better. So that's really what our data has shown.\nMax Gumport: Okay. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Palmer: Thanks. I'm wondering, if maybe at the end of this call, obviously, we're all going to have to take a crack at earnings for 2025. And I'm wondering, if maybe we could put some brackets around how you're thinking -- how you would think right now, given some base case assumptions, some of the things you're talking about, the reset incentive compensation, that 2% to 4% top line cohort cost realities today. Is it safe to say we'd be thinking something like a double-digit earnings decrease for 2025? How can we maybe think about that further?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. I mean, we'd love, David, to give more precision around what that range would look like. I think, the challenge, and you kind of said it in the question is the cocoa reality today is evolving. And so it's very hard to kind of give guidance on the total until we get more visibility or full visibility, let's say, into what that impact is going to be next year. We've talked about some of the headwinds from our tax normalization and incentive normalization. Clearly, there's going to be a significant year-over-year impact to cocoa, but exactly what it is, we're just not in a position yet to share it.\nDavid Palmer: Okay. Understood on that. And just one question on the top line, you went through in the prepared remarks, a great reminder about the long-term growth of 15-year growth in the confectionery category. And not only that, but Hershey has done a great job in terms of market share growth and had big areas of growth and outsized growth from things like Seasons, the Reese's Power brand I'm wondering how you're thinking about the sort of the shape of your growth and the contributors of growth maybe those outsized areas of growth as you're going forward? Whether that be non-chocolate confectionery, which has been outperforming chocolate recently, maybe channel, how are you thinking about the candidates for outsized growth for you in 2025 and beyond? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. So I would say, certainly, salty, as we look at our entire portfolio is going to be a big area of growth. Strong growth in the category, lots of household penetration upside for us on those businesses. Distribution expansion, suite certainly because suites is a growing area of the category, also an area where we are underdeveloped. Certainly, seasons, we've continued to have strength and so we will continue to look at ways for that to drive us going forward. I would say some of the channel opportunities we think are big ones and a lot of those would come through relative to chocolate. And I think I kind of categorize that chocolate would be more in line with and slightly better than the category, but probably the biggest inflection point in 2025 versus some of the others that I mentioned.\nDavid Palmer: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Carey: Hi. Hi, everyone. I just wanted to go back to a reference in the prepared remarks that you'll be dealing with fewer headwinds in 2025 than you experienced in 2024. I think it's really a top line comment. Michelle, you flagged convenience stores probably weak into the front half, but then maybe get better. It sounds like you expect execution to get better in-store as well, potentially with a new leader for infection. Just what are the things that when you think about fewer headwinds and the year-over-year helpers that you're really thinking about when you insert that comment in the prepared remarks?\nMichele Buck: Yeah, there were several, and Steve can jump in if I missed some of them, but we exited the Mexico drink business. So that was a drag on the business this year that we won't experience retail inventory, which I think Steve referenced a little bit earlier. Certainly, some of the pressures that we had at that key retailer around reduced merch that we will have fully lapped the ready-to-eat popcorn softness that we had seen on SkinnyPop again, we should be through most of the lap on that, that was creating pressure. There were some pressures from year two leaky buckets on some innovation, and we've pulled some of those smaller items to get away from that. Steve is there any -- that was the only other one, I think, that we've called out.\nSteve Voskuil: And then, of course, you have positives on the other side, right? We've got a longer Easter. We've got very strong innovation pipeline, both year 1 and year 2 for next year with some strong investment behind it. Michele has talked about the Suites momentum, the inflection in SkinnyPop. So absence of negatives and opportunities on the growth side.\nChris Carey: Okay. Thank you. And then one quick follow-up would be, Michele, you did reference several times in -- throughout this Q&A session, what it sounds like desire for execution just to be a bit better. And clearly, you have new leadership with the business. How would you frame maybe this past couple of years of market share between innovation versus in-store execution that can be merchandising, RGM [ph], what have you. But it just does feel like there's a tinge of execution that you feel like that's been lacking and that can improve. So when you kind of think about the past several years, how meaningful has that execution been in market versus, say, some other factors? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. So I think there have been a couple of areas that I want to do better. Certainly, this past year, our summer activations in market did not perform as strongly as we had hoped, things like Olympics. I think that there are some areas where there were some changing dynamics in the category. So there was increased competition from private label and smaller manufacturers in take-home. So we had a really good innovation calendar but it was focused on sites and on instant consumable and our innovation did incredibly well there. But with that stepped-up level of new competitors in take home, we found that we need even more there. So as we look at seasons, we had some instances where we had a variety of offerings and perhaps our retail partners didn't always have the optimal or choose the optimal portfolio. We think that we can partner with them and influence in a greater way. And then I think just some areas of opportunity, probably not weak execution but opportunity. We talked a lot about some of the work we did on gold standard shelf I take home a few years back. We're implementing that right now for instant consumables. I think that, that will lead to some stellar results for us. So, as well as the focus that we're putting on some of our variety brands portfolio and really executing that well within instant consumables as well. So, those are some of the areas of focus.\nChris Carey: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you so much.\nMichele Buck: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Leah Jordan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.\nLeah Jordan: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. I was seeing if you could provide more color on the increased competition that you're seeing in confection domestically. What do you think is different in the environment now that that smaller players in private label are having a meaningful impact, as you called out? And how do you plan to address these pressures?\nMichele Buck: So, I think as it comes to private label, certainly, I think that's driven by the consumer pressure and focus on value And certainly, I think retailers looking to -- at their margins and the potential that exists there. I think as it goes to smaller players, some of the some of the barriers to entry with digital media enable a bit more of that to come into the category as well as with sweets because I would say sweets has some -- an easier door to open to the category as well. Where we are really focused is how do we really have the right offerings, the total value proposition. So, if we look at instant consumables, for example, it's always about the highest velocity items everywhere. So, there are some instances where we put out some innovation and shelf space that we took during the pandemic and the items we're doing okay, but now there are some smaller players who came in and have competitive velocities, and we need to switch out some of the items we have for even stronger items. So, I think it's really a focus on that.\nLeah Jordan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. Steve, I don't want to beat the horse, so to speak, but I do want to come back a little bit to the pricing conversation for next year. I know you had said previously restated today, you've taken a bit high single-digit pricing on about half of the North America confection portfolio, maybe the total portfolio. But I feel like that still implies probably somewhere around a mid-single-digit range for North America confection in 2025. And I'm just trying to marry that to the comment that pricing next year would be essentially similar to what we're seeing this year because it would seem like it actually would be a little higher next year given some of the pricing on cocoa. So, maybe if you can just kind of help me understand that.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. I think the biggest disconnect is probably just due to the mix of items that are being priced. I think we talked a little bit about on a pounds basis, with about 50% of the pounds being priced and when you kind of flow that through the portfolio, that's what kind of gets you back to that, I'd say, similar, not exactly the same, but similar to what we saw this year.\nRob Dickerson: Okay. Okay. Fair enough. And then I guess the other question is just kind of around the comment you made in the prepared remarks about kind of trade and media spend increasing a little bit? It sounds like maybe there's a little bit more push on core brands, maybe not Reese's, but brands like Almond Joy and Mounds PAYDAY [ph]. And I just remember, Michele, I don't know if we go back and kind of making this off like 5 years ago or so, right, there was a little bit of an initiative to kind of lean into those brands a little bit. It seemed like maybe you continue to lean on them, but if we lean into them a little bit more now, what does that mean? Does that just mean kind of more social media, overall marketing dynamics? Does it mean maybe a little bit more innovation coming from those brands? Just trying to gauge kind of where you can take those brands maybe improve the overall efficacy of the portfolio. Thanks. That\u2019s all.\nMichele Buck: Yes. Absolutely. So it is prioritizing the distribution of those brands. Most of those brands, they are biggest parts of their growth is in regular account. So we have king-sized brands, and we have brands that are big regular account. We think now given the focus on consumer value and entry-level price points, really making sure that we have a robust portfolio there and then continuing to invest in those brands to give them the marketing support, which then, of course, leads to those strong velocities that will outpace many of the other newer competitive items who may be trying to game distribution in the category.\nRob Dickerson: All right. Thank you so much.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no additional questions at this time. Would you like to make some further remarks?\nMichele Buck: Yes. Thank you all for joining us today. I look forward to speaking with many of you in the next few days and coming weeks.\nOperator: Thank you. This will conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Sure. On the reference to the algorithm, we're talking about our long-term algorithm. So that's two to four on the top. So that's the reference point that we're looking to. In terms of realized price, all-in, we'd expect pricing next year to year to look a lot like this year. As the price increases, we took this flow through. Obviously, we'll work to make sure we're competitive. And work with retailers to make sure we get good execution of that. And then from an elasticity standpoint, we expect historical elasticity, which is what we've seen as we progressed further through this year. You bet. Thanks, Ken. Hi, Andrew."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Steve, do you want to take that? Thanks, Ken. Good morning Absolutely. Thanks, Andrew. Yes, let me step back and talk a little bit about category and market share trends. So first of all, we continue to feel really good about the category resiliency that we've seen consistently growing about -- around that 2% range, which is what it's been historically and continuing to outpace other snack categories. So we think that's a really good starting point for us. We do see us ending the year with greater momentum than we have had particularly if we look at some of the green shoots that we called out in the script relative to sweets and the acceleration that, that innovation that we launched in the marketplace is really taking hold, driving takeaway and also increasing share with each 4-week period that goes by, we had a great Halloween and expect that we will have one share in Halloween. SkinnyPop, certainly, we called for a reversal in trend. We've seen that in the past 4 weeks. Innovation remains strong. And then we have a few labs that we are starting to get into that period that lessens the pressure that we're facing. We had spoken before about reductions in merge the key retailers. Last 12 weeks, we've seen over 2% growth there. So, as we look forward, we feel good about a lot of those things, combined with as we get into next year, a longer Easter other headwinds that are bit less relative to SNAP, Mexico drinks and some of the retailer inventory issues. So, I would say it's going to be, I would say, a gradual improvement that we do think will build both in terms of dollars and percent. And probably the piece of the portfolio that will remain under pressure will be instant consumable because convenience stores, we really saw some of the pressure in that channel start midyear. So we think it will take us through the first half to get through that. The other pieces of the portfolio we're expecting to continue to see recovery. Yes, absolutely. So obviously, Mike is a really strong exec coming to us from PepsiCo. Several things that I think he will bring, number one, always appreciate external perspective and always a good chance to relook what we're doing well, where we can continue to be better. Secondly, he has a very deep and rich background of being incredibly close to customers and retail. And I think that he will significantly that up even further as we go forward into the future to unlock new growth and continue to evolve our portfolio to those channels where consumers are migrating to. Thank you. Good morning. Alexia? Now we can. Yes. Yes. So we would say we're seeing a mild year-on-year impact, I'd say, consistent with what I think we've shared before in line with what we would expect, which I would say is more a gradual impact. We've continued to see multiple sources of data validating that the consumers on those drugs are eating disproportionately less our categories. I know there's been some mix data, but we've seen a lot on that. So it's in line with what we expect, and we are carefully monitoring that behavior, how it's evolving and certainly understanding what the needs are of those consumers so that as we continue to evolve our portfolio, which we're always doing over time, that are evolving it in a way to make sure that we have the right offerings for those consumers as well. Yes. A lot of it has been pricing competition where certain competitors have chosen to really deal back somewhat deeply on price point. And that's in some of the markets where we tend to be a smaller player. Yes, and it's a smaller market for us, but it's been intense in those markets where it has occurred. Yes. So I'll hit the 2026. So we do feel good that can be on algorithm if cocoa is stable and if cocoa prices really declined, there could be some outsized growth possible, certainly. So we're watching the cocoa price carefully, but we are feeling good based on what we believe and see that we would be on algorithm or have some upside. Good morning. I'll share some thoughts and I'll ask Steve to as well. So clearly, we continue to believe in the importance of investing in our brands. We think that's also really important in an environment where prices are where they are. That said, we have really good marketing mix models. We continually look at generating higher ROIs each year. We hold ourselves to that standard. We are also always looking at things like new media agency RFPs that can drive meaningful productivity. We do have that as we approach 2025. So we're trying to be very thoughtful about investing where we think it makes sense. Strategically, there's an area next year that we really want to focus on in terms of incremental investment in our variety brands to really bolster the instant consumable business. Steve, other things you want to add there? Yeah. All the analysis that we have done has continued to show that the year-on-year impact is not significant and that the pressure in the snacking categories are really driven by the consumers feeling pressured financially. So, every piece of data that we've seen has really indicated that. And then, of course, on some elements of our business, some opportunities for us to be executing better. So that's really what our data has shown. Yeah. So I would say, certainly, salty, as we look at our entire portfolio is going to be a big area of growth.

I would say some of the channel opportunities we think are big ones and a lot of those would come through relative to chocolate. And I think I kind of categorize that chocolate would be more in line with and slightly better than the category, but probably the biggest inflection point in 2025 versus some of the others that I mentioned. Yeah, there were several, and Steve can jump in if I missed some of them, but we exited the Mexico drink business.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Anoori Naughton, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. Naughton, you may begin.\nAnoori Naughton: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's second quarter 2024 earnings Q&A session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. In addition, we have posted a transcript of the pre-recorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session, we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call. Please note that during today's Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements [including] (ph) expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck, and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.\nKen Goldman: Hi. Thank you. And Melissa Poole, I think you're probably somewhere in the call. I think you're still there. Thank you for all your help over the years. And Anoori, congrats on your new increased role. I wanted to ask within North American Confectionery this quarter, as you mentioned, there was 6% impact from lower retail inventory and around 2% to 3% from the Halloween shift. You seem confident that these impacts will have no real material effect on the year, which I understand. But my question is, is it unfair for investors to ask if there isn't at least a small red flag underlying this news? And I'm just asking because historically in food, destockings, delayed orders haven't always been for benign reasons. Sometimes they're, I guess, outgrowths of softer end user demand. So, just curious what gives you confidence there's not a relationship between the delays and demand, which seems to be implied by your commentary.\nMichele Buck: Steve, you want to take that?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah, I'd be happy to. I mean, as we've seen in the last few years, there's been actually quite a bit of volatility around inventory levels, partly based on the COVID era and supply chain challenges. And so, I think what we're seeing now is a more reversion to the way it's been more traditionally, which is [handling ships] (ph) more in the third quarter than in the second quarter. So, the change from prior year -- but we had good visibility into our seasonal orders already. Most of those orders are in hand. We've got strong expectations for the seasons, a lot of retailer collaboration. And so, I think as we look at it, we don't see it as a red flag. We see it as a more reversion to a traditional order pattern.\nKen Goldman: Okay, thank you for that. And then, quickly, I wanted to ask about your recently announced pricing. Can you perhaps give us a sense of which products it covers, the magnitude of the increase? And can you walk us through the degree to which you're comfortable taking this pricing right now, given some elasticity and that you're one of the few categories to be doing so? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Absolutely. So, as you all know, we have experienced historic cocoa prices for some period of time now. And while we believe the current cocoa price is not sustainable, we do believe that the future prices will be higher levels than we've seen before this kind of recent historic pricing cycle. Our approach on the pricing has been to take a measured approach. We've absorbed a lot of inflation already, but we do believe we need to pass some of it on. And we're seeing the category hold up fairly well in this tougher environment. We think it's historically been very rational. We think it will continue to be. So, overall, we are not going to price the entire portfolio. We do have a robust internal process where we take a lot of factors into consideration to determine what our approach will be, but that's what gives us confidence. We will be getting about 6 points to 7 points of net price realization. At this point, we don't want to go into a lot of the specifics around the pricing. It was very recently announced, and so it is still out there being sold into customers. And we think from a competitive perspective at this point, we shouldn't go into too much more detail. We are assuming that we'll see historic elasticities, which is a little bit worse than we have seen in our recent price increases. So, we think that that's the right approach as we plan for this on the business going forward.\nKen Goldman: Great. Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Thanks, Ken.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning, everybody.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nAndrew Lazar: Michele, I wanted to dig in a little bit more on market share trends in core chocolate. I know share trends have been weaker I think than expected particularly in everyday items even though Hershey is lapping some share losses in core chocolate last year. And I know last year there was more of a focus on capacity additions, but I guess I was -- I thought this year would mark a return to more innovation, more normal levels of sort of in-store commercial activity and such. So, I'm just trying to get a better understanding of what you think is driving those share losses and maybe when you'd expect to start to see those trends start to inflect, particularly in light of your intent to take some incremental pricing, albeit justified pricing?\nMichele Buck: Yeah, absolutely. So, first of all, I'd say we are encouraged that we continue to see category growth in that roughly 2% range. All along as we planned the year, we had expected our second half to be stronger, better than the first half due both to lapse as well as the timing of programming. And we had also anticipated Q2 to be a weaker takeaway quarter for us than Q1, given the timing of season, Reese's Caramel and then also some programming shifts where we had some programming that prior year was in Q2 that we shifted to Q3. That said, Q2 was a bit lighter than we anticipated both from a category perspective in terms of where consumers were shopping and what they were buying and certainly also from a share perspective. If I look at the areas of pressure in share that we saw in the quarter, sweet is an area that continued to be strong and certainly we under-indexed on sweets. As we look at the back half, we have significant incremental innovation with the Shaq launch, with new forms, et cetera, that we think is really going to help offset that. We saw pressure, particular pressure that hit us in C-store, given some of the weakening of those C-store channel trends, as well as an uptick in take home in club where we're less developed. And then finally, of course, the biggest factor that we had spoken about in the past, kind of the reduction -- continued reduction in key retailer merch, which reverses in the back half. So, as we look at the back half, we feel good about the progress that we'll have on sweets. Certainly, the strength of our programming from an innovation perspective, lapping that merch reduction at the big retailer, we have visibility into resets and we know that we're going to have advantaged position in resets in several key retailers, that's going to be a plus for us. And also, as we look season second half to first half, we are a big share player at seasons. First half had the weekend Easter with a short season and we have strong visibility to seasons in the back half. So, we know that that will drive share as well.\nAndrew Lazar: Great. And then, just a quick follow-up on the reduction in retailer merch that's kind of impacted the last couple of quarters that you'll be lapping, I guess, what was like the sort of post-mortem on that, if you will? Typically, some of these things kind of -- the pendulum swings too far maybe in one direction and then key retailers sort of figure out that it does make sense to put -- to have lots of different points of interruption, if you will, across the store because it's such an impulse item. So, I'm just curious like any lingering effects that you expect from that or not so much? Thanks.\nMichele Buck: I would say, I think that we're seeing things I would say neutralize. I would say that sometimes those things do go to more extremes and I think they -- while they don't revert back to where they were, I do think that there's more neutralization down the middle a bit more.\nAndrew Lazar: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. Please proceed with your question.\nAlexia Howard: Good morning, everyone.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Hello.\nAlexia Howard: So, can I just start with the question on the incentive comp being down? Does that imply that this quarter was something of a disappointment relative to plan maybe because the timing of the shipments for Halloween or the retailer inventories were run down? And what should we expect to have happen on those incentive payments going forward?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. The biggest driver on the incentive side is just tracking with what our expectations are from a full year standpoint. And so, we -- at any quarter, we true-up where we're at year-to-date and the outlook for the full year. And that's the benefit that we're -- say, benefit that's flowing through into the incentive comp right now.\nAlexia Howard: Okay. And -- but the full year is the same or ish, I mean, there's only minor reduction in guidance this year. Obviously, this quarter was a disappointment relative to expectations. So, I was just trying to -- does that mean that the comp sort of bounces back next quarter and normalizes?\nSteve Voskuil: No. We wouldn't expect it to bounce back. We are -- incentives are structured as more than just, say, the headline numbers. There are things other goals and objectives underneath there. There's different parts of the portfolio that have different goals. So, even though the headline numbers may not change that much, some of the underlying incentive calculations can change. And so, as I say, we trued-up every quarter. We're not expecting it to come back. I would look at it as a step down for the second quarter that will continue to pull through the back half.\nMichele Buck: And that's [full-year] (ph) reduction in guidance does have an impact, I mean, a meaningful impact on the comp.\nAlexia Howard: Got it. Okay, perfect. And then, on the gross margin, you mentioned that this quarter, obviously, you're still expecting 200 basis points decline for the full year. This quarter, you talked about input cost timing favorability. Which input cost was that on? Presumably, it wasn't cocoa, because I thought you had that locked in at the end of last year. So, just curious about the dynamics on input costs.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. There are a couple of things inside there for the second quarter. One is that we did have some movement in mark to market of derivatives for our hedging. And so, it's not a change from the past. We always have for current periods some mark to market that flows through the segment reporting. In this case, because of the volatility in commodities plus the business performance, and as always, the mix of instruments and tools that we use to hedge, we had some favorability there that came through relative to input costs. That's hard to predict. It varies quarter to quarter, but that was one of the pieces. We also made some small changes to -- as part of our ERP system in the way we match cost to products, that didn't have a big impact on the quarter, but slightly positive as well. As we look at those pieces, we look at them all as timing based and so we expect to see those come back in the back half.\nAlexia Howard: Great. Thank you very much. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.\nBryan Spillane: Hi. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone.\nMichele Buck: Good morning, Bryan.\nBryan Spillane: Hey. So, Michele, I guess, a question I think you're going to get or we're all going to be asking over the balance of the year is just consumer receptivity of a price increase and maybe why normal elasticity. And I say that in the context of if you look at your own results, right, it's clearly a value shift, right? Dollar stores, club stores doing well, convenience stores not doing as well. Pepsi is cutting prices, right, on Frito, because they priced too high. There was -- the lift on merchandising wasn't very good. Mondelez is trying to get a $3 price point instead of a $4 price point in front of people's eyes. So, it just seems like a lot of the other snacking peers are adjusting down maybe to start stimulating demand. So, just how you think about that in the context of trying to take another price increase?\nMichele Buck: So, certainly -- as we put together the pricing, certainly we're experiencing outsized inflation versus I'd say some other peers. That said, we do really focus on the consumer. As we look at historic price elasticities, our recent pricing increases, we have been better than historical elasticity levels. So, we are putting in place a more conservative assumption on elasticity than we've seen in the past. That said, we also really take a surgical approach across the portfolio, with a lot of analysis to look at the key price points we need to be at, to offer the right range of opportunities for consumers. We've got a pretty significant amount of our portfolio that's under the $3 price point, and we've made choices across the portfolio about where we think those price increases will benefit and work and some places that we've chosen not to lean in on price. We also continue to optimize reinvestment and look at the total bundle of value because we know value includes both price points, but also seasons provides value, innovation provides value, and then reinvestment in the right precise price points from a promotional perspective as well. So, kind of that holistic approach is what makes us feel good about it.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. And then, Steve, if I could just one quick follow-up, I think you mentioned it might have been in the prepared remarks, cocoa and beginning to start laying in a little bit for '25. If we think about the gross margin expectation for this year for '24, should we assume that you've got visibility or you're pretty much locked in on cocoa? So, if it moves around, it's more of a '25 versus '24 factor we should think about?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. For '24 itself, I'd say we're pretty well locked in on cocoa. And the only caveat I would say is like we saw this quarter, there's still some potential for some mark to -- some in-quarter mark-to-market movements that could go through this year, but cocoa supply and largest part of the cocoa cost lapped for this year. As we get to next year, of course, as we get further into the year, we'll share more about expectations for next year. I mean, it's no surprise, current cocoa prices still significantly up versus where they have been in the past. That's, of course, necessitating the price increase that we're talking about. So, more to come on '25, but for this year we feel pretty confident about where we're sitting from a commodity basket standpoint.\nBryan Spillane: Okay. Thanks for that, Steve. Thanks, Michele.\nSteve Voskuil: You bet.\nMichele Buck: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. Please proceed with your question.\nDavid Palmer: Great. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up on the previous question on pricing. You mentioned the 6% to 7% price increase. Is that consistent with what you would expect for North America Confection in your reported results for '25, or is -- are there timing issues there? Just wanted to check on that. And then separately, your commentary and guidance seems to imply stabilization or at least some acceleration into the second half in North America Confection. I just wanted to get your temperature. What of the stuff that you've talked about, Shaq, the new Reese's, the channel expansion that you talked about maybe with club and then the restoration of merchandising with that key retailer, what about that is the most important to that acceleration?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. On the -- let me take. On the pricing side, you can't take the 6%, 7% net for the full year for Confection. This price increase is going to be phased in. Some parts will be phased in later this year. Some parts will be -- have impact next year. So, don't take that all the way. But we look overall mid single-digits in 2025 is the way to think about it.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. I guess, if I was going to zero-in on some of the biggest second half driver, certainly the lap on the large retailer, merch and resets is significant. So, I would put that first and foremost, and we have really good visibility into what that should look like. Secondly, the impact of season, that differential, also large and strong visibility into the sell-in for those seasons and then the sweets innovation is also one of the big drivers. And then lastly, I'd say the continued salty -- we really haven't talked much about salty, but the continued salty acceleration, we have seen the momentum shift on that business. Certainly, Dot's has remained strong, but SkinnyPop is seeing a regaining momentum and we expect to continue to see that in the back half.\nDavid Palmer: Great. That's helpful. I'll pass it on. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP Paribas. Please proceed with your question.\nMax Gumport: Hey, thanks for the question. In the prepared remarks, you discussed consumers pulling back on discretionary spending and C-store weakness. So, I was hoping to get a bit more color on what you're seeing there, particularly around the remark about seeing it really pick up over the last two months. And then, also a bit more color on how long you expect this dynamic could persist? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. I mean, I think in times where consumers are forced to make choices and pull back on some of their discretionary spending, they're even more focused on getting the best value that they can. And so, shifting where they are making some of their purchases, where normally they may not go out of their way to do that, I think during those times, this is something they're doing, and I think that's why we're seeing some of the shift away from convenience store into more mass dollar, et cetera. And I think we've started to see that the first part of this year. I think I would expect to see that as we continue through the year. We do have confidence that we can continue to shift and offer the right offerings across all those channels. One of the strengths in our business is our ability to do that. And certainly, as we lap that, we will see that stabilize and/or grow.\nMax Gumport: Thanks. And then, with regard to the commentary of historic elasticity expected with the price increase on the North America Confection business, is that historic elasticity right around 1 or a 0.9? And just a bit more color on what's giving you the confidence that it will be right around that level? Thank you.\nMichele Buck: Yeah, you're right. It is right around 1. And based on the models that we use and what data points we have, we would say that we feel pretty good that that's our -- a good estimate for now. We are building in some of that conservatism versus where we've been in the past. And that's really for price in isolation. There are other levers that can help to offset that relative to things like increased innovation, seasons, improvements in activity at customers, et cetera, et cetera.\nMax Gumport: Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Palmer with Citi. Please proceed with your question.\nTom Palmer: Good morning, and thanks for the question. You mentioned your view that current cocoa prices are not sustainable. And I just wanted to understand in the context of the round of pricing that you announced, how you're thinking about covering longer-term pricing, so -- sorry, longer-term inflation. So, does this round of pricing kind of cover your view of where cocoa prices might migrate longer term?\nMichele Buck: So, our strategy regarding pricing to cover commodities hasn't changed, that remains in place. But as we've discussed before, we don't view that as totally linear, as in when the price goes up there's an automatic coverage. So, I'd start by saying, if we look at where prices have already been in terms of -- and the fact that we've mentioned that we have some coverage for '25, it would be a fair assumption to assume that this pricing will not fully cover inflation. Steve, anything you want to add to that?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. No, that's right. We continue to manage pricing as one of many levers. And so, we're also looking at cost reduction productivity, we're looking at formulation, we're looking at all kinds of levers that we've talked about in the past to manage cocoa price, still very volatile. And as I said before, given even where it is today, and it's down from where it was earlier this year, if we kind of took current prices and flash ahead to the future, it's pretty still a very significant year-over-year inflation piece. And so, this pricing action will help. It's not by itself going to mean that we're already at long term covering the total cost, but it's a good first step, and you can expect we'll take other steps across all the levers that we have in the basket to address.\nMichele Buck: And we'll continue to monitor cocoa pricing. Certainly, we know there's been some positive news recently, but we also believe there won't be any significant impact in pricing until there's much greater visibility in the fall harvest, which is a bit of time from now.\nTom Palmer: Okay. Thanks for that detail. And then, just any help kind of thinking about the puts and takes as we think about the third quarter versus the fourth quarter in terms of maybe some of the earnings cadence? Obviously, shipment timing is a big factor, but maybe any other help on kind of the progression of gross margin or underlying sales trends?\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. On the -- it's a little more tricky to probably go quarter by quarter, but maybe if I just say, hey, as we look across the back half versus the front half, as we look at the back half, we're going to expect to see more AAA savings. We've been saying most of that's back-half loaded. We'll see some of that come through and some of that does impact gross profit. We'll have our regular CI productivity that I think we said on the earlier calls about $140 million target for the full year. We're right on track for that, but there's more of that to come in the back half than we saw in the first half. We'll also be lapping some incremental costs that we had in the back half of last year. Some of that was that for related warehousing and so forth. Most of the timing items, we would expect to reverse in Q3. So, I think we'll see more of those benefits reverse in Q3, but the others will continue over the back half. On the other side, as I think about back half gross margin, we'll have more commodity inflation, we'll have more seasons mix naturally coming in, and that seasons mix is slightly dilutive to margin. We'll have a little bit more sweets growth and sweets growth also a little bit dilutive from a margin standpoint and the reversal of some of the mark-to-market and other timing items that we talked about, again, mostly in Q3.\nTom Palmer: Okay. Thank you for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. Please proceed with your question.\nRobert Moskow: Hi, thanks. Just wanted to know if you could kind of elaborate on your thinking for marketing support. There was a big increase last year and I think the plan was for another increase this year. Where do you stand on your how much marketing is going to increase this year? Has anything changed? And as you get into 2025, because of these incremental costs that you're going to have to take into account, how do you think about marketing relative to sales into '25? Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. So, we don't see a significant change in our marketing support versus what we had planned. As we look to this year, still up in line with our sales growth.\nRobert Moskow: And the next year?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. And as we think about next year...\nSteve Voskuil: For next year, I'd expect also to match roughly in line with sales. And we're not far enough down all of our game planning for next year. We'll get more details later in the year, but I think from a planning standpoint, assume that it's going to at least match what we're doing from a sales standpoint.\nRobert Moskow: Okay, great. Thank you.\nSteve Voskuil: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.\nJim Salera: Hi, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking our question. Michele, in the prepared remarks, you talked about in salty strong trends with Dot's and then kind of improvement for SkinnyPop in the back half of the year, but the salty category as a whole has seen some pressure, and obviously more promotional activity probably coming into the category. So, just maybe walk through puts and takes on what gives you the confidence for Dot's maintaining momentum in the back half of the year and then SkinnyPop reaccelerating?\nMichele Buck: Yeah, absolutely. So, certainly, we've continued to see tremendous growth on Dot's. I'd start by saying on Dot's, we continue to have a lot of more upside on expanding our depth of distribution. There are still distribution opportunities, whether it's by geography, whether it is depth within a store, space on shelf, given velocities. And we also have continued strong investments in Dot's relative to both marketing support and then also innovation relative to pack types and flavors. One example, recent launch of Parmesan Garlic. So, we continue to just have all the marketing levers still present opportunity on Dot's, because that brand has really still been in the kind of introductory phase. As I think about popcorn, I would say, yes, there's been some pressure on the category. We are seeing some stabilization as we lap some of the consumer concerns in that category and we continue to feel good about the stepped up innovation opportunities on SkinnyPop as well relative to flavor pack size and also marketing investments, which we have dialed up more recently as well in combination with lapping some of the softness from last year.\nJim Salera: Okay. That's helpful. And maybe to drill down a little bit on the Ready-to-Eat popcorn, is part of the softness there just consumer preference for like trading out or opting for another substitute good instead of the popcorn, or is there something particular with that cohort, where the consumption trends are a little bit lighter there relative to something like Pretzels or Dot's?\nMichele Buck: Yeah. I mean, what we uncovered was the satiety factor was impacting total value proposition. And so that's what we started to see some softness on last second quarter. And we're now at a point where we're really starting to lap that and see it stabilize as we head through the back half of the year.\nJim Salera: Great. Thanks for the color. I'll hop back in the queue.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. Please proceed with your question.\nMichael Lavery: Thank you. Good morning.\nSteve Voskuil: Good morning.\nMichele Buck: Good morning.\nMichael Lavery: You touched on having some coverage for 2025 for cocoa. I'd imagine you don't want to be too specific, but more than halfway through the year now -- more than halfway through 2024 and with at least sort of an average maybe of kind of typically looking 12 months ahead, would we estimate or assume reasonably that you're kind of half covered for the year? I guess part of the question is, how much are you maybe looking to be patient for better rates, or kind of more focused on securing supply? Maybe just a sense of how kind of that securing product for 2025 is progressing? And related to that, maybe, I know you would ordinarily give an update in February when you report 4Q on the next calendar year. Is there any chance later this fall, when you've got plans put together, you might give a little preview sooner than normal, or should we expect just the typical cycle in terms of that news?\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. Yeah, on the -- specifics on hedging, you're right, I can't really give color around how far out we're hedged for 2025. As I said, our policy hasn't changed. And so, we've got some guardrails. It's fair to assume we've got some level of coverage in 2025, but we're still watching the market and the volatility. And so, we'll continue to, through our normal process, monitor that and take coverage as appropriate. As we get later in the year, as our visibility increases, I would hope to be able to provide a little bit more color. Again, a lot will depend on, as we sit here, for example, on the third quarter call what we see and how much visibility we do have into cocoa and probably some other variables as well. That would be the hope. We'll see how we're sitting when we get there, but we'd love to be able to provide more color once we have the visibility we can give you to rely on.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. And just as far as -- obviously, the cocoa cost pressure is very well known, does that do anything to influence how you might think about portfolio optimization, maybe diversifying a little bit more away from chocolate specifically, or any other way that it might impact how you think about managing the portfolio?\nMichele Buck: Hey, I mean, we're always looking at the best portfolio to meet consumer needs. We love the categories that we're in. And as you know, we've made decisions to expand and leverage our core capabilities that are so strong in snacking more broadly across snacking with our -- particularly with our launch into salty a few years ago. We also look across our -- even our chocolate portfolio and try and optimize our demand creation. We have certain parts of the portfolio that have more cocoa and chocolate, and certain parts like cookies and cream that may have others, but our goal is always to go where the consumer is.\nMichael Lavery: Okay. That's helpful. Thanks so much.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.\nChris Carey: Hey, good morning. Thank you for the question. I just have one follow-up on levers, and then a clarification on the back half. Steve, just regarding the levers, in the prepared remarks, there was a statement that the pricing was the first step to cover inflation. I couldn't tell if the implication was that you're assessing the pricing in market before perhaps taking other pricing, or pricing is just one of your many tools in the toolkit to manage inflation. And then just regarding the toolkit, where is the most effort being put right now as far as levers to offset inflation, whether that's product reformulation, price pack, incremental productivity, maybe even have some tax savings. Doesn't feel like marketing will be a key source of savings. So, just you've had time to kind of prepare for this. Where is a lot of that work going right now? And then -- sorry for the long question, but just in the back half of the year, the 4 points visibility seems about 1 point is seasonal. Is the rest [Technical Difficulty] the innovation, or is there any of the 6-point kind of destock in Q2 coming back in the back half? Thanks for all that.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. On the first part of your question, this is really just our normal strategy. We're always looking at the market. We're looking at cost. We're looking at pricing. And so, this isn't -- the comments weren't intended to say, hey, this is a tripwire pricing, and we're waiting to -- we will always be looking at pricing, and we'll be looking at all the levers. So, just to address that. In terms of levers, I would say we're focused on all of that, but some -- we've talked about in the past, PPA is a big one. We want to make sure that we are, as Michele said earlier, bringing value to consumers going where they are. We've got a lot of initiatives underway, some of which are contemplated in this price increase, but other things that we're working in collaboration with retailers to bring to bear in the next couple of years. So that continues to be a focus. And then things like the transformation program to drive cost savings all through the P&L, also one of the pieces, one of the levers that we can use, and driving production efficiency off the back of some of those technology investments. So, wide span of tools, but those are ones that are getting a lot of attention. And then on the back half, your question was just -- can you -- just ask you to repeat that last piece.\nChris Carey: The question is basically there's roughly 4 points in the back half of shipment visibility highlighted in the prepared remarks. I can get to about 1 point of that being seasonal. The rest of that, is that incremental innovation, or just other proactive initiatives you have? Or is any of that this 6-point retail reduction in Q2 -- I couldn't tell because there was a comment about retail inventory should be in line with current levels into the full year. So, I didn't know if you were getting some of that back, or the rest of the shipment visibility and other things. Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil: Sure. The back half guidance doesn't require any increase in retailer inventory. So, like I said, we're at a level now that we might have expected to be at. The end of the year would be typical, but we're not expecting any increase in retailer inventory. And as far as some of those drivers we touched on some of them earlier for the back half and you have as well, we will have more innovation relative to the first half season will play a role. We'll have some easier laps in a couple of businesses. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, international will have some easier last salty as well given the ERP implementation there in the fourth quarter of last year. So, those are the things that give us confidence in what we can do from a business standpoint in the back half.\nChris Carey: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.\nRob Dickerson: Great. Thanks so much. Maybe just a quick question for Steve. Just in terms of those levers, right, I mean clearly, you've outlined the $700 million in gross savings. I think it's through '26. So I'm just curious, kind of given the clear elevated cocoa cost situation, like is there a little bit more flex in those savings maybe to help offset some of those costs, or you just kind of preplan that too well, there are reinvestment needs that have already been earmarked, and we'll see what we can do, but not really? That's the first question.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. I'll say we're very focused on the cost side, absolutely. And so, as we look through the transformation work, as we look through the ongoing productivity work and even now moving past ERP and some of the savings we can leverage off the back of that, so all of those things are helping us focus on costs to help make some impact on what we can do from a cost savings standpoint. And as we said, we're expecting a net $300 million savings over that period. So, if not $300 million, then reinvest portion. We want $300 million net after reinvestment to hit the P&L.\nRob Dickerson: Yeah. I guess I would just say like, could you take the $300 million to like $350 million because maybe the cost situation changed? I mean, it sounds like you're not budgeting...\nSteve Voskuil: Sure.\nRob Dickerson: Yeah, okay.\nSteve Voskuil: Yeah. Well, I would just say we felt like we went pencils down on cost savings once we put that program in place. We continue to look all the time for cost savings. And believe me, all the pressure is up to find more.\nRob Dickerson: Yeah. Fair enough. Okay. Cool. And then I guess, Michele, just kind of a question around some of this kind of ongoing discretionary spend softness on chocolate, because I kind of ask because, I mean, clearly, we've seen a tremendous and kind of ongoing growth on the sweet side of the business, so which you -- I guess, one could argue it's still somewhat discretionary and clearly still a much smaller piece of the U.S. broader confection market. So I guess, just first, kind of maybe like why do you think consumers have maybe increasingly shifted to kind of non-chocolate confection, one? And then, two, maybe how broad is the Shaq-a-licious launch expected to be as we get through the back half of the year? And then, three, like could there be any acquisition opportunities that you would maybe dream of, you don't have to name names, but yes, it could be an area of interest? That's all. Thanks.\nMichele Buck: Yeah. So first of all, I'd say chocolate is still growing. And the non-chocolate growth that we're seeing doesn't appear to be sourcing much from chocolate. We do believe that there's growth in that area due to some of the kind of the emotional factors around fun, dress release, and frankly, there's been a lot of news and innovation in that segment. So, in addition to value playing a role, there are many other main drivers, I would say, that do make sweets appealing, and it's one of the reasons that we've really ramped up our innovation in that space with Shaq with the launch of a new form in the back half and continued investment in those brands.\nRob Dickerson: All right, fair enough. Thank you so much.\nMichele Buck: Thanks.\nSteve Voskuil: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Stephen Powers with Deutsche Bank. Please proceed with your question.\nStephen Powers: Good morning. Thank you so much. So, I know we're late in the call. I wanted to ask maybe kind of a wrap-up and longer-term question. A little over a year ago, you obviously outlined a number of initiatives to drive the next phase of long-term growth for the company at your Investor Day. And a lot of news at that time a discussion around upgraded commercial capabilities, digital network and supply chain optimization, workforce planning, et cetera. A lot of that you've touched upon it in bits and pieces today as well. But I guess when you step back, just given all the volatility you've experienced in the time since that day and kind of what you see ahead over the next 12-plus months, how would you assess your ability to keep pace with the cadence of change and improvement that you had envisioned during that Investor Day? Have you been able to largely keep pace amidst all this noise, or are there areas where the honest assessment is you'll have to do some catch up when the demand and cost environment hopefully stabilizes?\nMichele Buck: Well, I would say we have continued to drive really hard on all of those capabilities around digital workforce planning, et cetera. Steve referenced the transformation program. And that transformation program includes a lot of those components, and we have continued to make progress on that. So, starting with the completion of S/4, which we were able to successfully do, so that is now behind us. That was the foundation. Many of the work streams that enable us to deliver the transformation cost savings that we are on track to deliver involve technology and automation and digital solutions to enable that. So, those things are continuing to move ahead. So, I'd say it's kind of an 'and', which is dealing with the current pressured environment and continuing to drive ahead on all of those initiatives that are part of the transformation.\nStephen Powers: Okay, great. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor over to Ms. Naughton for closing comments.\nAnoori Naughton: Thank you all so much for joining us this morning. We look forward to catching up with you in the coming days and weeks. Have a great rest of your day.\nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.",

I mean, as we've seen in the last few years, there's been actually quite a bit of volatility around inventory levels, partly based on the COVID era and supply chain challenges. And so, I think what we're seeing now is a more reversion to the way it's been more traditionally, which is [handling ships] (ph) more in the third quarter than in the second quarter. So, the change from prior year -- but we had good visibility into our seasonal orders already. Most of those orders are in hand. We've got strong expectations for the seasons, a lot of retailer collaboration. And so, I think as we look at it, we don't see it as a red flag. We see it as a more reversion to a traditional order pattern. Good morning. Yeah. The biggest driver on the incentive side is just tracking with what our expectations are from a full year standpoint. And so, we -- at any quarter, we true-up where we're at year-to-date and the outlook for the full year. And that's the benefit that we're -- say, benefit that's flowing through into the incentive comp right now. No. We wouldn't expect it to bounce back. We are -- incentives are structured as more than just, say, the headline numbers. There are things other goals and objectives underneath there. There's different parts of the portfolio that have different goals. So, even though the headline numbers may not change that much, some of the underlying incentive calculations can change. And so, as I say, we trued-up every quarter. We're not expecting it to come back. I would look at it as a step down for the second quarter that will continue to pull through the back half. Yeah. There are a couple of things inside there for the second quarter. One is that we did have some movement in mark to market of derivatives for our hedging. And so, it's not a change from the past. We always have for current periods some mark to market that flows through the segment reporting. In this case, because of the volatility in commodities plus the business performance, and as always, the mix of instruments and tools that we use to hedge, we had some favorability there that came through relative to input costs. That's hard to predict. It varies quarter to quarter, but that was one of the pieces. We also made some small changes to -- as part of our ERP system in the way we match cost to products, that didn't have a big impact on the quarter, but slightly positive as well. As we look at those pieces, we look at them all as timing based and so we expect to see those come back in the back half. Yeah. For '24 itself, I'd say we're pretty well locked in on cocoa. And the only caveat I would say is like we saw this quarter, there's still some potential for some mark to -- some in-quarter mark-to-market movements that could go through this year, but cocoa supply and largest part of the cocoa cost lapped for this year. As we get to next year, of course, as we get further into the year, we'll share more about expectations for next year. I mean, it's no surprise, current cocoa prices still significantly up versus where they have been in the past. That's, of course, necessitating the price increase that we're talking about. So, more to come on '25, but for this year we feel pretty confident about where we're sitting from a commodity basket standpoint. You bet. Sure. On the -- let me take. On the pricing side, you can't take the 6%, 7% net for the full year for Confection. This price increase is going to be phased in. Some parts will be phased in later this year. Some parts will be -- have impact next year. So, don't take that all the way. But we look overall mid single-digits in 2025 is the way to think about it. Thank you. Yeah. No, that's right. We continue to manage pricing as one of many levers. And so, we're also looking at cost reduction productivity, we're looking at formulation, we're looking at all kinds of levers that we've talked about in the past to manage cocoa price, still very volatile. And as I said before, given even where it is today, and it's down from where it was earlier this year, if we kind of took current prices and flash ahead to the future, it's pretty still a very significant year-over-year inflation piece. And so, this pricing action will help. It's not by itself going to mean that we're already at long term covering the total cost, but it's a good first step, and you can expect we'll take other steps across all the levers that we have in the basket to address. Yeah. On the -- it's a little more tricky to probably go quarter by quarter, but maybe if I just say, hey, as we look across the back half versus the front half, as we look at the back half, we're going to expect to see more AAA savings. We've been saying most of that's back-half loaded. We'll see some of that come through and some of that does impact gross profit. We'll have our regular CI productivity that I think we said on the earlier calls about $140 million target for the full year. We're right on track for that, but there's more of that to come in the back half than we saw in the first half. We'll also be lapping some incremental costs that we had in the back half of last year. Some of that was that for related warehousing and so forth. Most of the timing items, we would expect to reverse in Q3. So, I think we'll see more of those benefits reverse in Q3, but the others will continue over the back half. On the other side, as I think about back half gross margin, we'll have more commodity inflation, we'll have more seasons mix naturally coming in, and that seasons mix is slightly dilutive to margin. We'll have a little bit more sweets growth and sweets growth also a little bit dilutive from a margin standpoint and the reversal of some of the mark-to-market and other timing items that we talked about, again, mostly in Q3. For next year, I'd expect also to match roughly in line with sales. And we're not far enough down all of our game planning for next year. We'll get more details later in the year, but I think from a planning standpoint, assume that it's going to at least match what we're doing from a sales standpoint. You bet. Good morning. Sure. Yeah, on the -- specifics on hedging, you're right, I can't really give color around how far out we're hedged for 2025. As I said, our policy hasn't changed. And so, we've got some guardrails. It's fair to assume we've got some level of coverage in 2025, but we're still watching the market and the volatility. And so, we'll continue to, through our normal process, monitor that and take coverage as appropriate. As we get later in the year, as our visibility increases, I would hope to be able to provide a little bit more color. Again, a lot will depend on, as we sit here, for example, on the third quarter call what we see and how much visibility we do have into cocoa and probably some other variables as well. That would be the hope. We'll see how we're sitting when we get there, but we'd love to be able to provide more color once we have the visibility we can give you to rely on. Thank you. Sure. On the first part of your question, this is really just our normal strategy. We're always looking at the market. We're looking at cost. We're looking at pricing. And so, this isn't -- the comments weren't intended to say, hey, this is a tripwire pricing, and we're waiting to -- we will always be looking at pricing, and we'll be looking at all the levers. So, just to address that. In terms of levers, I would say we're focused on all of that, but some -- we've talked about in the past, PPA is a big one. We want to make sure that we are, as Michele said earlier, bringing value to consumers going where they are. We've got a lot of initiatives underway, some of which are contemplated in this price increase, but other things that we're working in collaboration with retailers to bring to bear in the next couple of years. So that continues to be a focus. And then things like the transformation program to drive cost savings all through the P&L, also one of the pieces, one of the levers that we can use, and driving production efficiency off the back of some of those technology investments. So, wide span of tools, but those are ones that are getting a lot of attention. And then on the back half, your question was just -- can you -- just ask you to repeat that last piece. Sure. The back half guidance doesn't require any increase in retailer inventory. So, like I said, we're at a level now that we might have expected to be at. The end of the year would be typical, but we're not expecting any increase in retailer inventory. And as far as some of those drivers we touched on some of them earlier for the back half and you have as well, we will have more innovation relative to the first half season will play a role. We'll have some easier laps in a couple of businesses. We mentioned in the prepared remarks, international will have some easier last salty as well given the ERP implementation there in the fourth quarter of last year. So, those are the things that give us confidence in what we can do from a business standpoint in the back half. Yeah. I'll say we're very focused on the cost side, absolutely. And so, as we look through the transformation work, as we look through the ongoing productivity work and even now moving past ERP and some of the savings we can leverage off the back of that, so all of those things are helping us focus on costs to help make some impact on what we can do from a cost savings standpoint. And as we said, we're expecting a net $300 million savings over that period. So, if not $300 million, then reinvest portion. We want $300 million net after reinvestment to hit the P&L. Sure. Yeah. Well, I would just say we felt like we went pencils down on cost savings once we put that program in place. We continue to look all the time for cost savings. And believe me, all the pressure is up to find more. Thank you."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Steve, you want to take that? Absolutely. So, as you all know, we have experienced historic cocoa prices for some period of time now. And while we believe the current cocoa price is not sustainable, we do believe that the future prices will be higher levels than we've seen before this kind of recent historic pricing cycle. Our approach on the pricing has been to take a measured approach. We've absorbed a lot of inflation already, but we do believe we need to pass some of it on. And we're seeing the category hold up fairly well in this tougher environment. We think it's historically been very rational. We think it will continue to be. So, overall, we are not going to price the entire portfolio. We do have a robust internal process where we take a lot of factors into consideration to determine what our approach will be, but that's what gives us confidence. We will be getting about 6 points to 7 points of net price realization. At this point, we don't want to go into a lot of the specifics around the pricing. It was very recently announced, and so it is still out there being sold into customers. And we think from a competitive perspective at this point, we shouldn't go into too much more detail. We are assuming that we'll see historic elasticities, which is a little bit worse than we have seen in our recent price increases. So, we think that that's the right approach as we plan for this on the business going forward. Thanks, Ken. Good morning. Yeah, absolutely. So, first of all, I'd say we are encouraged that we continue to see category growth in that roughly 2% range. All along as we planned the year, we had expected our second half to be stronger, better than the first half due both to lapse as well as the timing of programming. And we had also anticipated Q2 to be a weaker takeaway quarter for us than Q1, given the timing of season, Reese's Caramel and then also some programming shifts where we had some programming that prior year was in Q2 that we shifted to Q3. That said, Q2 was a bit lighter than we anticipated both from a category perspective in terms of where consumers were shopping and what they were buying and certainly also from a share perspective. If I look at the areas of pressure in share that we saw in the quarter, sweet is an area that continued to be strong and certainly we under-indexed on sweets. As we look at the back half, we have significant incremental innovation with the Shaq launch, with new forms, et cetera, that we think is really going to help offset that. We saw pressure, particular pressure that hit us in C-store, given some of the weakening of those C-store channel trends, as well as an uptick in take home in club where we're less developed. And then finally, of course, the biggest factor that we had spoken about in the past, kind of the reduction -- continued reduction in key retailer merch, which reverses in the back half. So, as we look at the back half, we feel good about the progress that we'll have on sweets. Certainly, the strength of our programming from an innovation perspective, lapping that merch reduction at the big retailer, we have visibility into resets and we know that we're going to have advantaged position in resets in several key retailers, that's going to be a plus for us. And also, as we look season second half to first half, we are a big share player at seasons. First half had the weekend Easter with a short season and we have strong visibility to seasons in the back half. So, we know that that will drive share as well. I would say, I think that we're seeing things I would say neutralize. I would say that sometimes those things do go to more extremes and I think they -- while they don't revert back to where they were, I do think that there's more neutralization down the middle a bit more. Hello. And that's [full-year] (ph) reduction in guidance does have an impact, I mean, a meaningful impact on the comp. Good morning, Bryan. So, certainly -- as we put together the pricing, certainly we're experiencing outsized inflation versus I'd say some other peers. That said, we do really focus on the consumer. As we look at historic price elasticities, our recent pricing increases, we have been better than historical elasticity levels. So, we are putting in place a more conservative assumption on elasticity than we've seen in the past. That said, we also really take a surgical approach across the portfolio, with a lot of analysis to look at the key price points we need to be at, to offer the right range of opportunities for consumers. We've got a pretty significant amount of our portfolio that's under the $3 price point, and we've made choices across the portfolio about where we think those price increases will benefit and work and some places that we've chosen not to lean in on price. We also continue to optimize reinvestment and look at the total bundle of value because we know value includes both price points, but also seasons provides value, innovation provides value, and then reinvestment in the right precise price points from a promotional perspective as well. So, kind of that holistic approach is what makes us feel good about it. Thank you. Yeah. I guess, if I was going to zero-in on some of the biggest second half driver, certainly the lap on the large retailer, merch and resets is significant. So, I would put that first and foremost, and we have really good visibility into what that should look like. Secondly, the impact of season, that differential, also large and strong visibility into the sell-in for those seasons and then the sweets innovation is also one of the big drivers. And then lastly, I'd say the continued salty -- we really haven't talked much about salty, but the continued salty acceleration, we have seen the momentum shift on that business. Certainly, Dot's has remained strong, but SkinnyPop is seeing a regaining momentum and we expect to continue to see that in the back half. Yeah. I mean, I think in times where consumers are forced to make choices and pull back on some of their discretionary spending, they're even more focused on getting the best value that they can. And so, shifting where they are making some of their purchases, where normally they may not go out of their way to do that, I think during those times, this is something they're doing, and I think that's why we're seeing some of the shift away from convenience store into more mass dollar, et cetera. And I think we've started to see that the first part of this year. I think I would expect to see that as we continue through the year. We do have confidence that we can continue to shift and offer the right offerings across all those channels. One of the strengths in our business is our ability to do that. And certainly, as we lap that, we will see that stabilize and/or grow. Yeah, you're right. It is right around 1. And based on the models that we use and what data points we have, we would say that we feel pretty good that that's our -- a good estimate for now. We are building in some of that conservatism versus where we've been in the past. And that's really for price in isolation. There are other levers that can help to offset that relative to things like increased innovation, seasons, improvements in activity at customers, et cetera, et cetera. So, our strategy regarding pricing to cover commodities hasn't changed, that remains in place. But as we've discussed before, we don't view that as totally linear, as in when the price goes up there's an automatic coverage. So, I'd start by saying, if we look at where prices have already been in terms of -- and the fact that we've mentioned that we have some coverage for '25, it would be a fair assumption to assume that this pricing will not fully cover inflation. Steve, anything you want to add to that? And we'll continue to monitor cocoa pricing. Certainly, we know there's been some positive news recently, but we also believe there won't be any significant impact in pricing until there's much greater visibility in the fall harvest, which is a bit of time from now. Yeah. So, we don't see a significant change in our marketing support versus what we had planned. As we look to this year, still up in line with our sales growth. Yeah. And as we think about next year... Yeah, absolutely. So, certainly, we've continued to see tremendous growth on Dot's. I'd start by saying on Dot's, we continue to have a lot of more upside on expanding our depth of distribution. There are still distribution opportunities, whether it's by geography, whether it is depth within a store, space on shelf, given velocities. And we also have continued strong investments in Dot's relative to both marketing support and then also innovation relative to pack types and flavors. One example, recent launch of Parmesan Garlic. So, we continue to just have all the marketing levers still present opportunity on Dot's, because that brand has really still been in the kind of introductory phase. As I think about popcorn, I would say, yes, there's been some pressure on the category. We are seeing some stabilization as we lap some of the consumer concerns in that category and we continue to feel good about the stepped up innovation opportunities on SkinnyPop as well relative to flavor pack size and also marketing investments, which we have dialed up more recently as well in combination with lapping some of the softness from last year. Yeah. I mean, what we uncovered was the satiety factor was impacting total value proposition. And so that's what we started to see some softness on last second quarter. And we're now at a point where we're really starting to lap that and see it stabilize as we head through the back half of the year. Good morning. Hey, I mean, we're always looking at the best portfolio to meet consumer needs. We love the categories that we're in. And as you know, we've made decisions to expand and leverage our core capabilities that are so strong in snacking more broadly across snacking with our -- particularly with our launch into salty a few years ago. We also look across our -- even our chocolate portfolio and try and optimize our demand creation. We have certain parts of the portfolio that have more cocoa and chocolate, and certain parts like cookies and cream that may have others, but our goal is always to go where the consumer is. Yeah. So first of all, I'd say chocolate is still growing. And the non-chocolate growth that we're seeing doesn't appear to be sourcing much from chocolate. We do believe that there's growth in that area due to some of the kind of the emotional factors around fun, dress release, and frankly, there's been a lot of news and innovation in that segment. So, in addition to value playing a role, there are many other main drivers, I would say, that do make sweets appealing, and it's one of the reasons that we've really ramped up our innovation in that space with Shaq with the launch of a new form in the back half and continued investment in those brands. Thanks. Well, I would say we have continued to drive really hard on all of those capabilities around digital workforce planning, et cetera. Steve referenced the transformation program. And that transformation program includes a lot of those components, and we have continued to make progress on that. So, starting with the completion of S/4, which we were able to successfully do, so that is now behind us. That was the foundation. Many of the work streams that enable us to deliver the transformation cost savings that we are on track to deliver involve technology and automation and digital solutions to enable that. So, those things are continuing to move ahead. So, I'd say it's kind of an 'and', which is dealing with the current pressured environment and continuing to drive ahead on all of those initiatives that are part of the transformation."

I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Ms. Melissa Poole, Vice President of Investor Relations for The Hershey Company. Thank you. You may begin. \nMelissa Poole: Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today for The Hershey Company's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Q&A Session. I hope everyone has had the chance to read our press release and listen to our prerecorded management remarks, both of which are available on our website. \n In addition, we have posted a transcript of the prerecorded remarks. At the conclusion of today's live Q&A session, we will also post a transcript and audio replay of this call. \n Please note that during today's Q&A session, we may make forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties. These statements include expectations and assumptions regarding the company's future operations and financial performance. Actual results could differ materially from those projected. \n The company undertakes no obligation to update these statements based on subsequent events. \n A detailed listing of such risks and uncertainties can be found in today's press release and the company's SEC filings. \n Finally, please note that we may refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures that we believe will provide useful information for investors. The presentation of this information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Reconciliations to the GAAP results are included in this morning's press release. \n Joining me today are Hershey's Chairman and CEO, Michele Buck; and Hershey's Senior Vice President and CFO, Steve Voskuil. \n With that, I will turn it over to the operator for the first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Andrew Lazar with Barclays. \nAndrew Lazar: Michele, I guess excluding the inventory build, underlying organic sales in North America Confectionery rose 2%. I think we and the Street had modeled it broadly more flattish. And recently, market share trends in chocolate have inflected following a year of weakness. \n I guess my question is, am I overplaying this? Or maybe are you, too, starting to see sort of building underlying momentum in the core Confectionery segment outside of all the ERP inventory noise? And would you expect to see a sequential improvement in volume trends in 2Q? \nMichele Buck: Yes. So Andrew, we are definitely -- we're very pleased with our Q1 top line performance. I would say that, overall, it was in line with our expectations. However, our market share did exceed expectations. And our strength was really driven by very strong performance in seasons, both overall and takeaway, as well as market share and also the strength that we had in innovation with Reese's Caramel, which not only did well with consumers, was the best innovation in the category and also was able to drive strong merchandising for us, particularly as we launched around Super Bowl. \n So we're feeling good about what we're seeing. And as we look to the rest of the year, we do expect some improvement in trends as we enter throughout the year and proceed towards the end of the year. \nAndrew Lazar: And then you mentioned in the prepared remarks improved display activity in the first half of this year versus the second half of last year. I know there's a lot that goes into that, but can we also take this to mean maybe that some of the headwinds you faced last year from a major customer going through what seems like yet another sort of clean store effort maybe has started to realize a bit that display and sort of multiple points of interruption for snacks improved sales? Or is that too strong a way to characterize it? \nMichele Buck: I would -- yes, I would say we are partnering very strongly with that retailer as we always do. And certainly, I think we both recognize some of those opportunities that we can go after. \n As we look at the performance year-to-date, a lot of the strength that we had seen versus second half of last year in merch was really across other customers versus that customer with seasons innovation and then really tying some of our media to events like the Super Bowl or March Madness driving merch. So we do anticipate that we will see some of the strength from merch with that retailer in the second half of the year. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Alexia Howard with Bernstein. \nAlexia Howard: Okay. So 2 questions. First of all, I know you're not going to comment on what you're doing with your cocoa forward contracting and hedging strategy. But could you give us a little bit more detail on the levers and options you have regarding sourcing for 2025, whether it's sourcing from other regions, obviously, timing of contracts, the amount of flexibility you can build into the system. Just some ideas of the types of levers that you can pull, given the amount of volatility that's out there in the cocoa market today. \nSteven Voskuil: Sure. Yes, I'm happy to take that one. So multiple ways to deal with the volatility. Obviously, the hedging program and the financial side is one way to deal and then the supply chain side, making sure we've got diverse sourcing. And we've done a good job of that over the years of really trying to diversify that supply chain footprint. \n And no doubt, looking back at the last few years, we'll continue to move that diversification forward. But that does give us some flexibility on sourcing. And of course, we have recipes that went and taste profiles and things like that, that guide those choices. But within that, we've got quite a bit of flexibility on the sourcing side. \nAlexia Howard: Great. And then are you able to comment on what you're seeing in terms of the state of the American consumer? We've been hearing a lot about this recently with lower-income consumers becoming more vulnerable. Any comments you can make on how much the SNAP spending cutbacks last year hit you? I don't know whether you're able to quantify that, but just comments on where you're seeing the American consumer headed at the moment. \nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. So we do know that we saw impact from the SNAP reductions in the business in the back part of last year. We are beginning to see some stabilization as we start to lap some of those reductions. Consistent with our expectations as we built our plan, we anticipated that, that would occur. However, we do continue to see value-seeking behavior from consumers. So that still hasn't changed. I'd say it's improving a bit, but it's still there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ken Goldman with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Goldman: I just wanted to follow up to your answer to Andrew's question about North America Confectionery. I think you said that you were -- that in general, it came in underlying, right, excluding the ship ahead, kind of in line with your expectations, but that your market share exceeded your expectations. So I guess, just mathematically, the category maybe didn't do quite as well as you had hoped. \n So A, I'm just trying to make sure I'm hearing that correctly. And B, if so, what do you attribute that to? Again, we all know there's been some elasticity and you mentioned the lower end struggling a little bit. Is it really just tied to that? Or are there other factors maybe we should consider? \nMichele Buck: Yes. I mean I'd say some of that is always tied to each key competitor and what their programming is like versus prior year. So our largest competitor, Mars, was a little bit soft for the quarter with share down. And I think a lot of that was driven by their innovation, the lap versus prior year with some of that innovation not sustaining, and those things do impact the category. So that looked to be one of the biggest drivers. \nKenneth Goldman: And then just pivoting a little bit to Salty. Obviously, your sales trends were much improved. I think it's fair to say that there's still maybe some opportunities in margin ahead. I just wanted to get a level of -- or get a sense of the level of how content you are with the A&P investment in that business? \n Do you expect to have to invest any more in price? Just I guess, how confident are you in kind of the building blocks to really get that business a little more stable to a position where you can grow it and expand margins at the same time? \nMichele Buck: Yes. So overall, Salty was on track with our expectations as well. We had very strong Dot's performance. And then, as expected, while SkinnyPop improved, we knew that the majority of that improvement would not occur until we get to lapping the Q2 period and going forward. SkinnyPop does remain pressured along with some of the rest of the ready-to-eat popcorn category. And we think that, that will shift once we get past that lap. \n As we move through the year, we do have strong media and trade investments behind both of the brands. We also have flavor and pack innovation that will help us both grow and also drive share gains in the second half of the year. \n From a profitability perspective, Q1 Salty profit was the weakest for the year where -- of where the business will be for the year. So you can expect that to get better going forward. And also the bigger increase in our advertising really starts to happen in Q2 and beyond working forward. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Max Gumport with BNP. \nMax Andrew Gumport: I realize you're not getting into 2025 pricing conversation on this call or commenting on cocoa inflation. Just curious if you could talk about some of the other factors that go into that framework, though. So you've talked a little bit about market share trends, but also what you're seeing with category volumes, health of the consumer overall, the competitive environment, cross-category elasticity concerns just as we try to think through what you're seeing. \nSteven Voskuil: Yes. We -- so on 2025, and I think that's where you're pointing the question, I would just say we're in the midst of building the '25 plan. And so obviously, yes, we're not going to talk about cocoa. \n As we look to the plan, there are a lot of levers we'll be looking at. And so pricing is a lever we'll look at, other supply chain savings. As we talked about in our last call, we've got some transformation savings that we'll be building in the years to come, including 2025. \n And so as we get further into the year, we'll be able to talk more about what we expect for 2025, including category health and what we think about the consumer and so forth. \nMax Andrew Gumport: Okay. And then turning to the comments on gross margin for 2Q '24. Any help you can give us in terms of the cost absorption that might reverse out in 2Q after a strong 1Q, given the inventory dynamics associated with the ERP cutover? I'll leave it there. \nSteven Voskuil: Sure. Yes. We expect to see that fixed cost leverage that we benefited from in the first quarter effectively fully reversed out in the second quarter. So order of magnitude, we had $20 million to $25 million of benefit of fixed cost absorption and then also a little bit of mix just based on the type of inventory that was built in the first quarter. And so both of those components should reverse out in full in the second quarter. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Nik Modi with RBC Capital Markets. \nNik Modi: Just 2 questions. Michele, I was wondering if you could just comment on kind of what you're seeing from a channel perspective, primarily C-stores, because some of the feedback we're getting is the traffic is really starting to come under some pressure. So would love your thoughts there. \n And then just kind of more broadly, one of the things that, obviously, we've talked about in the past has been this kind of cross-elasticity between what's going on in your business versus other potential alternatives for the consumer, whether it be snack bars or what have you. And I'm just curious, as you kind of think about the year, are you framing your promotional plans and your pricing -- and your price gaps more from that lens? Or are you still just more holistically or focused more specifically on just the categories in which you're competing? \nMichele Buck: Yes. So as it relates to C-store, our business in C-store has been holding up pretty well for us. So we really haven't seen a big change in trend, I would say, that we are focused on there. \n And as we look to price gaps, we always look at price gaps, both -- and price points, absolute price points, both within the category as well as across the snacking category. So that is really the standard way that we view our price elasticity, and we continue to evaluate it that way. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Michael Lavery with Piper Sandler. \nMichael Lavery: I just wanted to come back to the comments on 2Q. You called out the high single-digit decline you expect from the inventory reversing. But the last quarter, you said how you expect double-digit EPS declines in the first half. I don't, unless I missed it, believe you reiterated that, but would that still apply as well? \nSteven Voskuil: It does. Yes. \nMichael Lavery: Okay. Great. And then just as you think about any of the moving parts with some cocoa volatility or cost, maybe uncertainty at least, how -- you've also reiterated how you just think for the long term and want to approach the business that way. Would it be right to assume that, that does some amount of protection for AMC? How do you think about managing that as one of the variables? And is it something that is in play or is protected? What's kind of the approach there as far as the marketing spend? \nMichele Buck: Yes. I mean, I think strategically, we want to always continue to invest in our brands. We believe that's a key part of the model. And we know that if you break that investment, it can take some time to rebuild to get to kind of your threshold levels again. \n That said, every year when we build a plan, we reevaluate the return on all of those pieces of spending. And we have to have the right news. We have to have the right increases in effectiveness and efficiency to set the right level. \n So it's not to say that we are set at a specific budget or percent of net sales. Every year, we do adjust that based on what we're seeing in the returns, where the opportunities are, what kind of news we might have that we want to support, et cetera. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Spillane with Bank of America. \nBryan Spillane: I guess, Michele, can you give us some perspective, if you can, I guess. If you look at seasons in the first quarter and maybe just how consumers purchased around Easter and what the display and merchandising was like, does it give you any insight into Halloween maybe being any different this year or maybe needing a different approach for Halloween? \n And I guess, I say that in the context if we think about last year with the everyday business being so under pressure, right, it put a lot more pressure on seasons in Halloween and kind of the balance of the year to sort of drive the business. And trying to -- and it seems like that every day is, at least as a category or the small-format stores are under a lot of pressure. So I'm just trying to get an understanding if we have a lot of dependency on Halloween as we go through the end of the year and whether or not there's any sort of difference in the way consumers are shopping around holidays. \nMichele Buck: Yes, absolutely. So if I start with the beginning of the year, Valentine's, the category was strong and we performed very well there from a share perspective. \n The Easter category declined, but it was a shorter season, which always makes it more difficult, but sell-through was very good. And again, we gained share in that season as well. \n As we look at the second half of the year, we do feel like those trends are positive for the second half. But obviously, we had some very strong seasonal performance in '23. So we think second half will grow, but we think the growth will moderate and perhaps be more in line with our overall growth as a company versus kind of super-sized in the back half. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Robert Moskow with TD Cowen. \nRobert Moskow: Michele, I thought I remembered last quarter you saying that once you got past the ERP conversion completely and after second quarter, that's when you would start to evaluate pricing actions to cover higher costs. Did I get that right? And is that still your strategy? \n And then lastly, I was wondering like how do you know that -- how did you go about estimating how much extra inventory the customers pulled forward? You're expecting one thing, like maybe they would take a month of inventory. And did they just say, no, we want 2 months instead of 1 month extra? And then how do you know that maybe they weren't pulling forward shipments ahead of a perceived price increase? \nMichele Buck: So first of all, our teams have done an amazing job with the U.S. and Canadian S/4 implementation, and we don't take that lightly. So we're thrilled about that. And I think we are consistent with what we've said all along, which is, hey, we are in a pretty good position. We're shipping products, invoicing customers, et cetera. \n But we do consider ourselves at the end of that ramp-up phase and making sure that we have a stable system, can close the books at the end of the quarter and all of that. So yes, end of Q2 is when we believe we're maybe officially stable on S/4 and have options available to us. Of course, we never speak about any of our intentions or strategies around pricing or when we might or might not, but rather just that the capability exists to be able to. \n Relative to the excess inventory, frankly, we worked closely with customers because we wanted to understand how much inventory they wanted. I think a few things happened. We had some customers who maybe had not put in as much and communicated fully the requirements. So we had some of that, that added to inventory. Frankly, I think we saw some others who, in the face of other companies in the marketplace who were struggling with ERP implementations, it spooked some retailers into wanting a little bit more inventory. \n So I would say relative to what we saw and was communicated to us, that's really -- and we were actually able to execute more than we anticipated. We actually thought we had to plan for some kind of disruption in the start-up and assume that there'd be a cap on how much we could give retailers. So we were actually able to better fully meet what they really wanted versus originally, I think we kind of tried to cap them a little more just because we weren't sure we'd be able to deliver. Steve, is there anything you want to say? \nSteven Voskuil: And where we landed in the end, we feel, was a healthy level. And so in the second quarter, we'll see the vast majority of that bleed out. It wasn't too much. And we don't see that as a sign about trying to get ahead of price increases. The way price increases these days work their way to the market, prebuying inventory isn't really the common practice. So not much risk there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Palmer with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Palmer: Question on price elasticity. What do you think your price elasticity is on the chocolate products today? And do you have a sense of how that might change if you were to -- if cocoa prices remained elevated and if you were to need a large price increase heading into '25? Any thoughts about how that price elasticity might change? \nMichele Buck: What we've seen is no material change in our elasticities over the past several months. We remain in line with historical levels, which is about minus 1, and that's what we would assume going forward. \nDavid Palmer: Got it. And you're always so good on insights. There's been this post-COVID slowdown in at-home snacking and perhaps there's that overlay of the SNAP reductions causing -- or influencing that. But now there's talk of a weakening low-end consumer and perhaps convenience channels being relatively weaker now. \n I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the net of all these things going forward and if you're seeing crosscurrents between your different channels as you go through '24. \nMichele Buck: Yes. So certainly, I would agree that with value-seeking behavior that a lot of that is coming from lower-income consumers. And we've seen that relative to SNAP reduction and the trends that, that drove, frankly, in our business as well as, I think, across other edibles based on what other companies have shared as well. \n I would say that our C-store business is okay. And I would say mass, club and dollar are very strong. So you may be seeing a little bit of that value seeking based on where that shakes out. But I wouldn't say it's something that we have seen as significant or dramatic. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Chris Carey with Wells Fargo Securities. \nChristopher Carey: One quick question on gross margins. Did the complexion of your gross margin evolved at all through the year? I know there's some timing dynamics between Q1 and Q2, and the full year outlook is unchanged. But is productivity coming in better? Or are parts of inflation coming in worse, some parts of inflation coming in better? Just any insight on how your delivery against this target has evolved over the past few months and evolving over the balance of the year relative to your going expectations. \nSteven Voskuil: Yes, no change. We're still, as we talked about on our call last time, about 200 basis points down year-over-year for the full year. Productivity savings off to a good start, right in line with plan. So at this point, nothing material that would point to a reshaping. \nChristopher Carey: Okay. Yes. Just the follow-up is on the category comments. The way that I interpreted it was that some of this lower category at the beginning of the year is almost entirely innovation relative to your going expectations of your peer? Or is there anything else that you're seeing, which you would highlight as over and above just that one comment regarding the lapping of innovation for one of your important competitors? \nMichele Buck: No, nothing else that I would highlight on that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tom Palmer with Citi. \nThomas Palmer: I wanted to just ask a little bit differently. I know you're not talking about cocoa inflation for next year, but there are some moving costs beyond just the headline cocoa inflation. You've got conversion costs and I think you're buying more butter and liquor than powder. \n So when we just look at headline cocoa inflation, do these items like conversion and then the kind of the sub-items within cocoa that you're buying, do those soften the magnitude of inflation? Are they adding to it right now? Just trying to understand that piece of the dynamic. \nSteven Voskuil: Sure. Yes, you're right. Cocoa is sort of the headline, the big headline. But when you look at the cocoa derivatives, they are also increasing. And we won't comment about percent increase relative to cocoa price increases, but they are inflationary just as cocoa itself is. \nThomas Palmer: Okay. Understood. And on the Salty Snacks side, you noted nonmeasured channels as a driver maybe of outperformance versus what we see in scanner. Where is that really coming from? And is this like other retailers? Is this more on the e-commerce side? And should we think about it as velocity or expanded distribution? \nMichele Buck: Yes. So it is from club, especially some very nice increases on Dot's that we shared last year. We got incremental distribution. So at this point, it's from both distribution and velocity there. So Dot's was up about 30% to start the year, and we gained over 300 market share points. And club was one of the drivers of that. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Rob Dickerson with Jefferies. \nRobert Dickerson: Great. Michele, maybe Steve, too, we fully understand, right, not speaking to hedging practices and where you're positioned or how you're positioned or how you're thinking about the internal hedging dynamic. \n But I am curious, maybe just more broadly, we heard from another large confection company earlier this week that was able to speak in general as to just how you're thinking about this like global cocoa supply, right? \n I'm sure you have plenty of internal and external advisers trying to provide that perspective, and I'm sure it's a lot better than ours. So I'm just curious if you have any general comments around that is the first question. \nMichele Buck: Yes, we're happy to share. So I would say, overall, our views about what has driven the market are somewhat consistent with what that large competitor shared earlier. As we think about it, we think both structural and transient forces have been at play impacting prices over the past several months. It certainly started with poor weather, a poor weather that impacted crop. And then concerns about supply. \n But as we've mentioned previously, it's also about much more than just supply-and-demand economics, but rather the impacts of regulation like the EU deforestation regulation, market speculation and also the lack of liquidity. \n So we continue to closely monitor supply and demand in the short term, which are the things that we can most get data and information on. The market will start and has started to get some signals on the supply outlook for the main crop. That will happen over the summer. Early reads on mid-crop look good, but it's really early. So we continue to monitor that. \n We also have full coverage for '24. We have some coverage into '25, and then we remain very focused on executing what's within our control. Our business strategy is to drive growth, improve share, innovate, enhance our capabilities, drive cost efficiency as we continue to monitor that environment. \nRobert Dickerson: Okay. Great. That was very helpful. And then maybe, Steve, this one's a little bit more for you. I know you have the 2 programs focused on productivity and savings that grosses over the next 3 years $700 million. There's obviously some cost inflation already in the system, could be more forthcoming. I don't really think you've spoken much to the net productivity and savings, and I also don't expect you to give me an actual number. \n But I am just curious, how should we feel about the net impact ability on the P&L, again, broadly speaking, given just the -- what clearly is a material amount of savings and productivity over the next 3 years. That's it. \nSteven Voskuil: Sure. Maybe if I just take cocoa to the side and look at the rest of the business, our model is to offset inflationary costs over time through a variety of levers in the P&L. And that fundamental model is still in place. Of course, cocoa is certainly stressing it in the near term. But longer term, that is still the model to cover inflation. \n And so as we think about these savings programs, both the earlier one we discussed in the investor conference focused on productivity and the most recent one, which is a mix of SG&A savings and productivity, both of those, we like to focus on being a net benefit to the P&L over the horizon that we're talking about, which would imply we have to get other ongoing normal efficiencies to offset normal ongoing inflation. And so that's the way we're looking at those cost programs. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jim Salera with Stephens. \nJames Salera: Michele, I wanted to circle back to seasons and just dig down on -- you guys mentioned you gained share in Valentine's and Easter. Can you just talk through what's driving that? And then maybe if there's any learnings that you can take to apply to, I don't know if you'd characterize it as like a mini or a bonus season with the Olympics this year? \nMichele Buck: Sure. So as I look at winning in season, certainly, it starts with the right product portfolio. We feel good about the portfolio. We always have innovation at the seasons, and we feel good that we have the right innovation. \n Another key driver is merch. We did a very nice job with merch. And our retail sales teams work in stores to get the visibility that we really desired for the category and overall for our business. \n And then also, we had the ability to provide even more supply. As we've mentioned over the past several years, we had a couple of years where we were constrained by what we were able to deliver. And end of last year, we really got to a much fuller place in supply across our portfolio. \n And yes, all of those lessons we apply to those not traditional seasons, but those other occasional seasons, things like Super Bowl, March Madness and Olympics. And so we certainly plan to leverage those same levers to make Olympics a strong event for us in the summer. \nJames Salera: Great. And on the Olympics specifically, if I'm not mistaken, I think it's 2 weeks. And so should we expect like in-store activations on that to run for like 3 weeks or 4 weeks or any way to kind of size that up as we think about that at the end of the summer? \nMichele Buck: Well, we usually start some of those activations ahead of the event. Retailers like to kind of highlight the event and get people engaged on ahead of time. So you will see some of those displays start as early as June, really leading into the Olympics. And then depending on the retailer, you'll see them throughout the summer. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Baumgartner with Mizuho. \nJohn Baumgartner: So in terms of the International business, I mean, there's been some high-level comments about Europe over the past year or so, I think recognizing your presence there a bit more than in the past. And I'm curious how you're thinking about that market longer term. And would you say you're still on a trial period? Is there anything that still needs better understanding at this point? Just how do you think about Hershey's desire to maybe take the next steps? And I guess it's a pretty big market with some differentiated products. \nMichele Buck: Yes. So yes, it is a large market. And I think the approach that we've always taken over time is it is a very well-developed, established market. And therefore, we believe our best chances of succeeding are with a differentiated product. \n And after a lot of work, we have been successful in bringing Reese's to Europe. And really starting in the U.K., we've had some phenomenal success, but frankly, not a ton of investment in support in terms of on-the-ground people or other investments. \n So we now have a business that we feel good about that's profitable there, and that's really our primary focus. So we think about Europe a bit more from where we have that elements of a differentiated portfolio that we think can win. And depending -- I'm not looking at it as a big investment, but rather doing it efficiently to maintain strong margins. \nJohn Baumgartner: Okay. In the U.S., I'm curious, as the consumer encounters just sort of extended period of high inflation, are you seeing any changes in terms of demand drivers for your categories where maybe the pull in advertising isn't what it used to be? Does it require more price promo? Does it require more in-store display, more front-of-store presence? How do you think about -- or are you seeing any changes in sort of the efficiency of the demand drivers that are out there? \nMichele Buck: Yes. I mean, I guess one way that I think about it is making sure that we look at each occasion, which really comes down to kind of the pack types across the portfolio and ensuring that we have good entry-level prices based on how the consumer -- well, and I guess price is based on how the consumer perceives value. \n A lot of times for the lower-income consumer, it's about an entry-level price point that enables them to participate. In some categories, it's about volume that has a better price per ounce. \n So I think, to me, that might be the bigger piece. I do think areas like seasons and innovation also drive value above and beyond the base products. And so we've seen that as well. \nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Alejandro Zamacona with HSBC. \nAlejandro Zamacona Urquiza: Just a follow-up on the cocoa pricing discussion. So I'm curious on hearing any comments regarding the recent normalization. So recently, prices have declined 30% in the last couple of weeks. So any comments around that would be helpful. \nMichele Buck: Yes. Well, I think, first of all, that decline is just further evidence of the tremendous volatility that we're seeing in the marketplace. It's hard to peg what some of those declines. There are no new signals relative to supply and demand that are meaningful yet. \n I mean perhaps some early signs about the mid-crop, which leads us to believe that more of the decline is driven by some of the nonsupply-demand economic factors but some of those other factors that we've discussed relative to speculators, thoughts on regulation, et cetera. \nOperator: We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. And with that, I would like to turn the floor back over to Melissa Poole for any closing comments. \nMelissa Poole: Thanks so much for joining us this morning. I know there's another call, so we'll let you all go to make sure you can attend that, and look forward to catching up later today. Have a great weekend. \nOperator: This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

            "name": "Steven Voskuil",
            "content": "Sure. Yes, I'm happy to take that one. So multiple ways to deal with the volatility. Obviously, the hedging program and the financial side is one way to deal and then the supply chain side, making sure we've got diverse sourcing. And we've done a good job of that over the years of really trying to diversify that supply chain footprint. \n And no doubt, looking back at the last few years, we'll continue to move that diversification forward. But that does give us some flexibility on sourcing. And of course, we have recipes that went and taste profiles and things like that, that guide those choices. But within that, we've got quite a bit of flexibility on the sourcing side. Yes. We -- so on 2025, and I think that's where you're pointing the question, I would just say we're in the midst of building the '25 plan. And so obviously, yes, we're not going to talk about cocoa. \n As we look to the plan, there are a lot of levers we'll be looking at. And so pricing is a lever we'll look at, other supply chain savings. As we talked about in our last call, we've got some transformation savings that we'll be building in the years to come, including 2025. \n And so as we get further into the year, we'll be able to talk more about what we expect for 2025, including category health and what we think about the consumer and so forth. Sure. Yes. We expect to see that fixed cost leverage that we benefited from in the first quarter effectively fully reversed out in the second quarter. So order of magnitude, we had $20 million to $25 million of benefit of fixed cost absorption and then also a little bit of mix just based on the type of inventory that was built in the first quarter. And so both of those components should reverse out in full in the second quarter. It does. Yes. And where we landed in the end, we feel, was a healthy level. And so in the second quarter, we'll see the vast majority of that bleed out. It wasn't too much. And we don't see that as a sign about trying to get ahead of price increases. The way price increases these days work their way to the market, prebuying inventory isn't really the common practice. So not much risk there. Yes, no change. We're still, as we talked about on our call last time, about 200 basis points down year-over-year for the full year. Productivity savings off to a good start, right in line with plan. So at this point, nothing material that would point to a reshaping. Sure. Yes, you're right. Cocoa is sort of the headline, the big headline. But when you look at the cocoa derivatives, they are also increasing. And we won't comment about percent increase relative to cocoa price increases, but they are inflationary just as cocoa itself is.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Michele Buck",
            "content": "Yes. So Andrew, we are definitely -- we're very pleased with our Q1 top line performance. I would say that, overall, it was in line with our expectations. However, our market share did exceed expectations. And our strength was really driven by very strong performance in seasons, both overall and takeaway, as well as market share and also the strength that we had in innovation with Reese's Caramel, which not only did well with consumers, was the best innovation in the category and also was able to drive strong merchandising for us, particularly as we launched around Super Bowl. \n So we're feeling good about what we're seeing. And as we look to the rest of the year, we do expect some improvement in trends as we enter throughout the year and proceed towards the end of the year. I would -- yes, I would say we are partnering very strongly with that retailer as we always do. And certainly, I think we both recognize some of those opportunities that we can go after. \n As we look at the performance year-to-date, a lot of the strength that we had seen versus second half of last year in merch was really across other customers versus that customer with seasons innovation and then really tying some of our media to events like the Super Bowl or March Madness driving merch. So we do anticipate that we will see some of the strength from merch with that retailer in the second half of the year. Yes, absolutely. So we do know that we saw impact from the SNAP reductions in the business in the back part of last year. We are beginning to see some stabilization as we start to lap some of those reductions. Consistent with our expectations as we built our plan, we anticipated that, that would occur. However, we do continue to see value-seeking behavior from consumers. So that still hasn't changed. I'd say it's improving a bit, but it's still there. Yes. I mean I'd say some of that is always tied to each key competitor and what their programming is like versus prior year. So our largest competitor, Mars, was a little bit soft for the quarter with share down. And I think a lot of that was driven by their innovation, the lap versus prior year with some of that innovation not sustaining, and those things do impact the category. So that looked to be one of the biggest drivers. Yes. So overall, Salty was on track with our expectations as well. We had very strong Dot's performance. And then, as expected, while SkinnyPop improved, we knew that the majority of that improvement would not occur until we get to lapping the Q2 period and going forward. SkinnyPop does remain pressured along with some of the rest of the ready-to-eat popcorn category. And we think that, that will shift once we get past that lap. \n As we move through the year, we do have strong media and trade investments behind both of the brands. We also have flavor and pack innovation that will help us both grow and also drive share gains in the second half of the year. \n From a profitability perspective, Q1 Salty profit was the weakest for the year where -- of where the business will be for the year. So you can expect that to get better going forward. And also the bigger increase in our advertising really starts to happen in Q2 and beyond working forward. Yes. So as it relates to C-store, our business in C-store has been holding up pretty well for us. So we really haven't seen a big change in trend, I would say, that we are focused on there. \n And as we look to price gaps, we always look at price gaps, both -- and price points, absolute price points, both within the category as well as across the snacking category. So that is really the standard way that we view our price elasticity, and we continue to evaluate it that way. Yes. I mean, I think strategically, we want to always continue to invest in our brands. We believe that's a key part of the model. And we know that if you break that investment, it can take some time to rebuild to get to kind of your threshold levels again. \n That said, every year when we build a plan, we reevaluate the return on all of those pieces of spending. And we have to have the right news. We have to have the right increases in effectiveness and efficiency to set the right level. \n So it's not to say that we are set at a specific budget or percent of net sales. Every year, we do adjust that based on what we're seeing in the returns, where the opportunities are, what kind of news we might have that we want to support, et cetera. Yes, absolutely. So if I start with the beginning of the year, Valentine's, the category was strong and we performed very well there from a share perspective. \n The Easter category declined, but it was a shorter season, which always makes it more difficult, but sell-through was very good. And again, we gained share in that season as well. \n As we look at the second half of the year, we do feel like those trends are positive for the second half. But obviously, we had some very strong seasonal performance in '23. So we think second half will grow, but we think the growth will moderate and perhaps be more in line with our overall growth as a company versus kind of super-sized in the back half. So first of all, our teams have done an amazing job with the U.S. and Canadian S/4 implementation, and we don't take that lightly. So we're thrilled about that. And I think we are consistent with what we've said all along, which is, hey, we are in a pretty good position. We're shipping products, invoicing customers, et cetera. \n But we do consider ourselves at the end of that ramp-up phase and making sure that we have a stable system, can close the books at the end of the quarter and all of that. So yes, end of Q2 is when we believe we're maybe officially stable on S/4 and have options available to us. Of course, we never speak about any of our intentions or strategies around pricing or when we might or might not, but rather just that the capability exists to be able to. \n Relative to the excess inventory, frankly, we worked closely with customers because we wanted to understand how much inventory they wanted. I think a few things happened. We had some customers who maybe had not put in as much and communicated fully the requirements. So we had some of that, that added to inventory. Frankly, I think we saw some others who, in the face of other companies in the marketplace who were struggling with ERP implementations, it spooked some retailers into wanting a little bit more inventory. \n So I would say relative to what we saw and was communicated to us, that's really -- and we were actually able to execute more than we anticipated. We actually thought we had to plan for some kind of disruption in the start-up and assume that there'd be a cap on how much we could give retailers. So we were actually able to better fully meet what they really wanted versus originally, I think we kind of tried to cap them a little more just because we weren't sure we'd be able to deliver. Steve, is there anything you want to say? What we've seen is no material change in our elasticities over the past several months. We remain in line with historical levels, which is about minus 1, and that's what we would assume going forward. Yes. So certainly, I would agree that with value-seeking behavior that a lot of that is coming from lower-income consumers.

But I wouldn't say it's something that we have seen as significant or dramatic. No, nothing else that I would highlight on that. Yes. So it is from club, especially some very nice increases on Dot's that we shared last year. We got incremental distribution. So at this point, it's from both distribution and velocity there. So Dot's was up about 30% to start the year, and we gained over 300 market share points. And club was one of the drivers of that. Yes, we're happy to share. So I would say, overall, our views about what has driven the market are somewhat consistent with what that large competitor shared earlier. As we think about it, we think both structural and transient forces have been at play impacting prices over the past several months. It certainly started with poor weather, a poor weather that impacted crop. And then concerns about supply. \n But as we've mentioned previously, it's also about much more than just supply-and-demand economics, but rather the impacts of regulation like the EU deforestation regulation, market speculation and also the lack of liquidity. \n So we continue to closely monitor supply and demand in the short term, which are the things that we can most get data and information on. The market will start and has started to get some signals on the supply outlook for the main crop. That will happen over the summer. Early reads on mid-crop look good, but it's really early. So we continue to monitor that. \n We also have full coverage for '24. We have some coverage into '25, and then we remain very focused on executing what's within our control. Our business strategy is to drive growth, improve share, innovate, enhance our capabilities, drive cost efficiency as we continue to monitor that environment. Sure. So as I look at winning in season, certainly, it starts with the right product portfolio. We feel good about the portfolio. We always have innovation at the seasons, and we feel good that we have the right innovation. \n Another key driver is merch. We did a very nice job with merch. And our retail sales teams work in stores to get the visibility that we really desired for the category and overall for our business. \n And then also, we had the ability to provide even more supply. As we've mentioned over the past several years, we had a couple of years where we were constrained by what we were able to deliver. And end of last year, we really got to a much fuller place in supply across our portfolio. \n And yes, all of those lessons we apply to those not traditional seasons, but those other occasional seasons, things like Super Bowl, March Madness and Olympics. And so we certainly plan to leverage those same levers to make Olympics a strong event for us in the summer. Well, we usually start some of those activations ahead of the event. Retailers like to kind of highlight the event and get people engaged on ahead of time. So you will see some of those displays start as early as June, really leading into the Olympics. And then depending on the retailer, you'll see them throughout the summer. Yes. So yes, it is a large market. And I think the approach that we've always taken over time is it is a very well-developed, established market. And therefore, we believe our best chances of succeeding are with a differentiated product. \n And after a lot of work, we have been successful in bringing Reese's to Europe. And really starting in the U.K., we've had some phenomenal success, but frankly, not a ton of investment in support in terms of on-the-ground people or other investments. \n So we now have a business that we feel good about that's profitable there, and that's really our primary focus. So we think about Europe a bit more from where we have that elements of a differentiated portfolio that we think can win. And depending -- I'm not looking at it as a big investment, but rather doing it efficiently to maintain strong margins. Yes. I mean, I guess one way that I think about it is making sure that we look at each occasion, which really comes down to kind of the pack types across the portfolio and ensuring that we have good entry-level prices based on how the consumer -- well, and I guess price is based on how the consumer perceives value. \n A lot of times for the lower-income consumer, it's about an entry-level price point that enables them to participate. In some categories, it's about volume that has a better price per ounce. \n So I think, to me, that might be the bigger piece. I do think areas like seasons and innovation also drive value above and beyond the base products. And so we've seen that as well. Yes. Well, I think, first of all, that decline is just further evidence of the tremendous volatility that we're seeing in the marketplace. It's hard to peg what some of those declines. There are no new signals relative to supply and demand that are meaningful yet. \n I mean perhaps some early signs about the mid-crop, which leads us to believe that more of the decline is driven by some of the nonsupply-demand economic factors but some of those other factors that we've discussed relative to speculators, thoughts on regulation, et cetera."
