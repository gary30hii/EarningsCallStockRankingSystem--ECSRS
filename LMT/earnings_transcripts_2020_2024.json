At this time, all participants are in listen-only mode. Later we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Gardner: [Technical Difficulty]\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. And good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a great start to the New Year and at this call, I find you and your family safe and healthy. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. As we review our results, strategic new business activities, key accomplishments and our outlook for 2021. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the loss of Michele Evans, our aeronautics business area leader, who passed away earlier this month. Michele dedicated 34 years of service to our company and touched the lives of countless people both inside and outside the corporation. I knew Michele for years and I can say that she was the life of strength and grace. And while we mourn our loss, we also are thankful to had her as part of our Lockheed Martin family, we\u2019ll miss Michele.  As we look back to the year from a broader perspective, 2020 introduced personal and professional challenges to each and every one of us. I'll begin my summary of Lockheed Martin's results today by thanking the men and women of our company and their families, for stepping up to deliver outstanding performance during extremely difficult time. It was through their dedication and commitment that we were able to drive operational and financial results, which not only exceeded many of our expectations, but also set records in several areas. The coronavirus outbreak remains an ongoing pandemic and we're continuing to take actions to mitigate its impacts. Vaccines are also becoming available to help combat this disease and we're hopeful for a return to a more normal business environment, as we progress throughout the year. Our dedicated workforce and our resilient supply chain continue to perform with excellence during these demanding times, supporting our global customers and their important missions and I'm very proud of their accomplishments. Moving to our results, we delivered another year of outstanding performance in 2020, strategically, operationally and financially. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide our full-year 2021 financial outlook. But I'd like to provide a few highlights from the past year. A period in which we set high watermarks in sales, earnings and cash from operations. First, sales and segment profit each grew 9% over 2019 and our 2020 earnings per share increased by 11%. We had a strong year of cash generation, achieving $8.2 billion of cash from operations, even after a $1 billion voluntary pension contribution and after accelerating payments to our supply chain to help mitigate COVID impacts. We are continuing this practice, prioritizing our vulnerable and small business partners. We recorded over $68 billion in orders in 2020, growing our backlog by $3 billion, resulting in a robust $147 billion year-end total backlog. These results reflect a high level of execution being achieved across the company, providing critical security and deterrence solutions for our customers. As we look to 2021, our broad portfolio has us positioned for continued growth in all four of our business areas. We expect our cash generation to remain strong and we plan to continue our balanced cash deployment actions, investing in innovative technologies and strategic opportunities to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities and still returning cash to shareholders. Turning to defense budgets. For fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act has been passed into legislation and the Department of Defense Appropriations were approved as part of the FY '21 omnibus funding bill. Both of these congressional actions adhere to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, which established spending levels for discretionary, but defense budgets with a total fiscal year 2021 national defense spending target of approximately $740 billion. Also Congress passed $900 billion COVID relief package, which extended section 36-10 of the CARES Act to March 31, providing federal agencies the authority to reimburse contractors who are temporarily unable to work due to facility closures or other restrictions.  Lockheed Martin programs were well supported in the FY '21 appropriations bill with Congress adding funding of over $1.7 billion for 17 additional F-35 aircraft and other development and integration activities for the program. Adding nearly $900 [million] [ph] for 9 additional C-130Js plus support work for that airplane. And over $400 million for Sikorsky programs including additional CH-53-K and Black Hawk helicopters. And also the initiation of an 8 THAAD battery for the US Army. Turning to our portfolio, I would like to touch on several notable achievements, demonstrating our focus on strategic growth and operational performance. As we announced last month, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne, an action that once finalized will bring long-term strategic value to our entire portfolio. As we commented then our 21st century warfare strategy includes enabling growth areas such as hypersonics, tactical and integrated air and missile defense and space systems domains. Aerojet's expertise in propulsion systems will benefit our existing hypersonic programs as they progress from development to production and will improve our tactical missiles and air and missile defense products, while continuing Aerojet Rocketdyne's legacy as a merchant supplier to the entire industry. We believe this combination will deliver innovations and improve efficiencies that will offer more timely and affordable solutions for all of our customers, including the Defense Department domestic manufacturers and our international partners and we're very excited about this transaction. Moving to the business areas. In aeronautics, our F-35 team finished the year strong, delivering a total of 120 F-35 aircrafts. Our aero production organization, our partners, teammates in the supply chain, all worked to overcome manufacturing issues introduced by this pandemic. We've now delivered over 600 airplanes since the program's inception with nearly 360 jets still in backlog and domestic as well as international opportunities ahead of us. Over 2/3 of the jets in the plan of record are still to be ordered. So the aircraft continues to perform well, it's operating from 26 bases and ships around the globe. And the Royal Australian Air Force recently declared initial operating capability in December. The seventh country to do so since the program began. Also in our aeronautics business, the US Air Force awarded $900 million contract for us to provide sustainment and support services for F-16 aircraft, including maintenance and modification activities. Of course, the F-16 is one of our longest-running production programs and we will look to optimize the Air Force's F-16 fleet for greater capability, readiness and performance via this new sustainment contract. Moving to our space business area, we recently won a $4.9 billion award for our next generation Overhead Persistent Infrared or OPIR contract. This award funds the production of 3 geosynchronous satellites and ground systems to provide initial warning of ballistic or tactical missile launches anywhere in the world. These new space vehicles will have more powerful sensors and greater resiliency to enhance our Nation's air and missile defense capabilities well under the 21st century.  Keeping with our space organization, we're pleased to be selected for one of the awards to develop a prototype payload for the new evolved strategic satellite communication systems. ESS is designed to be the successor to the Advanced Extremely High Frequency constellation satellites, one of our signature programs that provide secure and survivable strategic communications for national leaders and tactical commanders alike. This is our OPIR satellites, the ESS Constellation is intended to provide improved resiliency, survivability and increased capabilities. We look forward to participating in this opportunity as we work to enrich our platforms with more mission systems content, which is another key facet of our 21st century warfare strategy. I'll close with our Rotary and Mission Systems and missiles and fire control business areas, which recently led Lockheed Martin's participation in an exercise Valiant Shield 2020, which is a bi-annual joint effort for the US Navy, Army, Air Force and Marine Corps. Our combined team used virtualized Aegis weapon system to conduct a pioneering, joint multi-domain, long fires demonstrations. By delivering machine-to-machine interfaces across joint force systems, this effort accelerated speed of decision making and then the action. It demonstrated a primary premise of our 21st century war fighting strategy by networking separate sensors, communication links and weapons across multiple platforms. The result is more effective joint all the main operations that provides enhanced capabilities and greater effectiveness to the commander in a field of operations. This achievement highlight our strategy to help address emerging threats with 21st Century capabilities, to invest in new and innovative technologies and leverage our signature programs to provide powerful deterrence to future military conflicts. That's our mission and with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Possenriede: Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share from continuing operations close with a record annual highs. We generated $8.2 billion of cash from operations after a $1 billion discretionary contribution to our pension trust this quarter and we continued our cash deployment actions, returning $3.9 billion of cash to our shareholders for a combination of dividend and share repurchases. While continuing to invest in the strategic growth of the business, including acquiring i3 and record investments in IRAD and capital expenditures. We also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne in the fourth quarter with the close expected in the second half of 2021. I will note that our 2021 outlook include -- excludes all results associated with this transaction. While backlog declined approximately $3 billion in the quarter due primarily to the timing of the F-35 lot 15 production order, 2020 represented the sixth consecutive annual increase in year-end backlog for the corporation. In summary, it was an outstanding year for the business and Lockheed Martin is well positioned for continued success in 2021. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 9% in 2020 compared with last year to $65.4 billion, continuing the strong performance over the first three quarters, while segment operating profit also increased 9% over last year to nearly $7.2 billion. On Chart 5, we compare sales by business area with last year's results. As Jim mentioned, all four of our business areas experienced strong sales growth in 2020 led by aeronautics and missiles and fire control at 11%. Aeronautics growth was driven by development and sustainment increases on F-35 and F-16 as well as growth in advanced development programs. Missiles and fire controls growth was primarily from production volume in Tactical Strike Missiles and air and missile defense lines of business. I will note that all four of our business areas achieved record highs for sales in 2020. Chart 6 shows our earnings per share for 2020. Our EPS from continuing operations of $24.50 was up $2.55 or 12% higher than our results from last year, driven primarily by increased volume and sustained performance. On Chart 7, we'll discuss our backlog. Driven by annual increases at three of our four business areas, we maintained a book to bill ratio above one for the full year of 2020. This continued backlog growth combined with further visibility of our 2021 orders, provides additional confidence in our increased sales outlook for 2021. On Chart 8, we'll discuss the cash return to our shareholders in 2020. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $8.2 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was greater than $6.4 billion nearly a 6% increase over to 2019. This growth was achieved despite accelerating more payments to our supply chain and we received from the favorable DoD initiated progress payment increases and the deferral of payroll taxes under the CARES Act. We increased our dividend by more than 8% and executed our planned share repurchases for the year with $1.1 billion in total shares retired. This brought our total cash returned to shareholders to $3.9 billion for the year or 60% of free cash flow providing a solid returns to the shareholders in 2020. Moving on to Chart 9. We provide our outlook for the year ahead. Our outlook for sales ranges from $67.1 billion to $68.5 billion. The midpoint of this range represents nearly a 4% increase over 2020 and improving from our October estimate, even after incorporating the impact of the UK March decision to insource contract support for the atomic weapons establishment. The $700 million sales reduction for this change is reflected in our outlook for the space business. We're not for this decision, our estimated sales increase would have been approximately 5%, which is greater than the estimated 3% sales growth we discussed in the last earnings call. We have incorporated the known COVID impacts into our 2021 financial outlook. We will continue to work with our US government customers to monitor COVID risk to our operations in the supply chain and we will continue exploring potential path to recovery of cost impacts, where appropriate to minimize future impacts. The range for segment operating profit is estimated to be approximately $7.4 billion to $7.5 billion. Our estimated FAS, CAS pension adjustment is approximately $2.3 billion. Our estimated range for 2021 earnings per share grows to between $26 to $26.30. The midpoint of this range represents approximately an 8% increase over 2020 results. Cash from operations is now projected to meet or exceed $8.3 billion and I will discuss this in greater detail on the following chart. On Chart 10, we will walk through our future cash expectations, folding in the $1 billion discretionary pension payment we made last quarter. Strong operational performance drove a reduction in working capital, which allowed us to increase our cash outlook for 2021 to greater than or equal to $8.3 billion. We now see approximately $8.7 billion of cash flow from operations in 2022, increasing our three-year cash generation estimate by $900 million over our prior assessment. And as we sit here now, we see 2023 cash from operations of approximately $9 billion. I should know this outlook and trends are prior to an estimated R&D tax deduction impact from the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act change that would impact 2022 cash by approximately $2.1 billion and lower 2023 cash by approximately $1.8 billion. On Chart 11, we break down our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area. All four business areas are positioned for continued sales growth in 2021, approximately 4% for the corporation, led by aeronautics at 5%. Segment operating profit growth is also projected to grow at approximately 4% into aggregate with our largest growth in Aeronautics at 6%. And finally on Chart 12 we have our summary. We believe 2020 was an exceptional year for Lockheed Martin during these challenging times. Our team diligently work to minimize the impacts of the pandemic to our business and our supply chain. We have increased our estimates for 2021 for all key financial metrics. Our results in 2020 exceed the previous highs and have positioned us well for continued growth and value creation this upcoming year. We remain focused on cash generation and growth in 2021, we will continue to invest in discriminating technologies and strategic initiatives to deliver value to our customers, while providing strong cash returns to stockholders. And with that, we're ready for your questions. Brad?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: Thank you for the question. Jim, could you speak to your broader space strategy? And I appreciate your comments on Aerojet in your prepared remarks. But can you be more specific on how it creates value, particularly in the absence of -- maybe a broader strategy or is it actually part of a broader rollout strategy? I mean, are you guys thinking about doing more strategic actions in space and how are you thinking about space for Lockheed Martin?\nJim Taiclet: Ron, I came into this role with Lockheed Martin being the leader in National Security Space, as it is. And the benefit of the position of the company is that we have a strong position in the -- I would say, classic large bus military defense satellites and intelligent community satellites. So we also have the ability to go down range into medium and lower, but as well as geosynchronous or and so. The whole playing field in national defense space is open to Lockheed Martin and what we're doing in the business is, we're introducing these 21st century technologies and taking advantage of that space platform. And so you see us winning recently a low orbit transport layer contract, which is a pioneering initiative of the Department of Defense to start introducing 5G and other modern networking technologies into the space domain, we're part of that. And what we've been able to do is to connect our space assets already using some of those newer technologies and AI and also distributed compute into our Aerospace, land and sea forces, as well the platforms that we deploy there. So we have a broad space strategy which is to take 21st century networking, storage and compute technologies into our space domain as really a competitive advantage versus other defense contractors that don't have that asset available to them. The second part of your question is, well how does Aerojet Rocketdyne create value in doing this? And it really goes hand-in-hand with our hypersonic strategy, which is part of our 21st century war fighting initiative. I view Lockheed Martin's benefit or role in defense enterprise is adding velocity to it. The world is moving faster, both kinetically if you will and in the networking and AI perspective as well and we need to speed up. And just taking one dimension of that hypersonic missiles and countering a hypersonic missiles requires a much better tighter integration of the propulsion system into the body of the missile. The heat generated by these hypersonic missiles is incredible and just managing that heat and thermal issue, is one of the reasons we invested in i3 as well. So, we are selecting what we think are the most important defense platforms and connectivity capacities for the future of warfare and we're investing in those. And Aerojet Rocketdyne is part and parcel of that investment strategy. Propulsion integration into hypersonic missile, glide bodies is essential. The other benefit of us working more -- in a more integrated fashion with Aerojet Rocketdyne is, we'll be able to bring our broad engineering expertise, our capital and our operational experience into Aerojet Rocketdyne and bring the best of Lockheed Martin to the propulsion side of missiles and space. So there are incredible synergies here, I know Ken can speak to a little bit more of on those later both revenue and costs, but given my long answer I'll stop there.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.\nPete Skibitski: Hey, good morning guys. Jim, can you talk about kind of your updated mid-term view of the DoD budget now that we have obviously new [sec-off] [ph] and administration, but maybe even more importantly a change of control to Senate. I'm just wondering what you're kind of seeing and hearing tea-leave wise in terms of the budget outlook? Thanks.\nJim Taiclet: Sure, Pete. The administration hasn't unveiled its actual plan or trajectory for defense budgets. But I take solace in a couple of things. One is that the national security and intelligence and international affairs team, President Biden is proposing has brought on is experienced, they are professionals in that realm of -- many of them having decades of senior government experience dealing with these issues and so you're going to have -- we believe a lot of continuity in policy and also in focus on how important strong defense is for this country. So I think the proposed team is a plus. And unfortunately, frankly the threat outside against potentially United States is growing. It's accelerating too by the way and when we look at the national defense strategy, it reorients itself and reorients our defense enterprise towards great power competition. And it's something you cannot just sit still and watch go by, because we will be overtaken because of the aggressiveness of our potential peers. So, I'm taking solace in these trends as far as the defense budget goes. That you have professional experienced people leading it for the administration and that threat environment is greater versus lesser, we feel that supports a stable defense budget going forward.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Ken, can you talk a little bit about the R&D tax impact. And I guess relative to the political backdrop, do you now see that playing out as more likely or is there still an outcome or that's less onerous. I mean, are you now planning differently than you were a few months ago in terms of the potential cash flow impact from that? Thank you.\nKen Possenriede: You bet. So yes, Joe, I have socialized with you guys as much as we could, once we concluded our view of what the tax law, the interpretation that was and as I stated a few times now it looks like it's about $2.1 billion in 2022, $1.8 billion in 2023 and it will continue trending down. One of the reasons we are extremely focused on cash, you heard in my prepared comments, the amount of cash that we're generating in '22 and '23. I've stated we've taken -- we took a pause for that roughly the second half of last year, before we started talking to the key constituents about that impact. It is still our belief that we think there is some likelihood it will either be repealed or altered, so it just doesn't include entire research expenses, which would include our cost-plus contracts. But would be just our research in our IRAD, our research and development costs, which would not be a material impact to our -- to the outlooks I gave you. We still think there is a good likelihood that's going to happen. Because if you think about it, if -- in 2022, we have $2.1 billion less of cash this is just Lockheed Martin and as you know Joe, this is not just Lockheed Martin and not just A&D, this is all of industry. So this is going to hit pharma hard, it's going to hit high-tech hard. These are dollars that we're not going to have the ability to plow back and invest into our portfolio and into our technologies. And I think that is a compelling story and I think at the end of the day, that's going to rule the day. Now having said that, we are still generating large amounts of cash. In fact, as you know, we ended the year in excess of $3 billion cash on hand. Right now assuming our dividend assumptions and our share repurchase assumptions for 2021, we're going to end 2021 with over $5 billion of cash. That number is going to continue to grow. And that frankly, that's a good opportunity for us to do the things Jim described from an investment standpoint and then to continue our robust cash deployment strategy that we have historically had with our shareholders.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, good morning. It's actually Mike Mogeri [ph] on for Hunter.\nJim Taiclet: Hi, Mike.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi, so according to your filings from 2009 to 2017, square footage in your spaces that you lease or own fell 8.5 million square feet or 15% while you are still growing revenue. So I know that you have an investment in Palmdale coming up. But in the next budget down cycle, flattening whenever it should come facility consolidation. Is that a lever you'd be willing to pull or able to pull again?\nKen Possenriede: Yes, thanks for the question, Mike. It's Ken. So I think this year or 2020, we're going to end with roughly 72 million square feet and there's four pieces to that. One is, the space we actually own and a large share of that is going to be manufacturing space and that's about half of our real estate. And then the other half is a combination of leased space. GOCO, which is government owned contract or operated much like our Fort Worth facility and then GOGO, which is government owned government operated, which is AWE. And so there is a couple of just short term, there's a couple of puts it takes. Assuming the UK government does take over the management of AWE, we lose about 4.5 million square feet out of that 72 million squares. When we're successful with the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition, I believe they have about 3 million square feet that we would add back. You mentioned Mike, the Palmdale building that we're building, we also have a little bit of real estate that we're expanding in space and in RMS and in missiles and fire control and that nets about 1 million square feet. So at the end of the day, we're going to be down about a 0.5 million squares. But now the opportunity comes, right now we have roughly half of our employees working remotely. Some of them are periodically coming in, but we have over the last couple of months have rolled out a plan. Frankly looking at Lockheed Martin forward is what we call-in and it's frankly the future of work. And we are going to start looking at, getting out of some of that leased space as our leases expire, you can expect us to reduce our foot print by at least a couple of million square feet in the next couple of years, if not more. We will go to more hoteling, we will allow people that where it makes sense for them to work from home and we'll make sure this is a competitive and strategic advantage for us.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Good morning, guys. Jim, maybe I'm following on the question on the new administration, but in a slightly different way. How do you think about opportunities and challenges regarding foreign military sales. With the new administration, do you see more headwind or more tailwind than before?\nJim Taiclet: Good morning, Kristine. As far as international business, including foreign military sales. The Tennessee -- the people in the Biden administration and the President's sound statements reiterate his view that alliances are important that they need to be cultivated and that they have real value and deterrence in National Defense. And so I do think that will have a more open environment for FMS and indirect commercial sales to our international partners. The other benefit you've seen it recently in the press is that, we have some fantastic an unmatched products that are in great demand and highly desired by many countries. So you've seen F16 sales coming back, F35 was a pivotal element of the Abraham Accords we believe. And that system is so highly desired by our allies in the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere that it actually helped putting a modicum of piece to the Middle East. And so our prop between our products and the Biden administrations stated proclivity to enhance our alliances, I think we're in a better position going forward.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Carter Copeland with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nCarter Copeland: Good morning, gentlemen. A big figure, Q4 is probably the best time to ask a question like this, just to get some color on it. But classified has obviously been a big component of bookings and growth in your focus. I wondered, if you might can give us some more color, if you can around how much classified grew in 2020 or some more color on bookings growth or if you can do that even relative growth versus the rest of the business. Just any kind of sense you can give us on the sort of seed corn projects that will fill out the revenue outlook in the next 3 to 5 years and beyond.\nJim Taiclet: You bet. Hi, Carter and unfortunately, I do have to be a little cryptic and I apologize for that, but I'll try to give you color to the best of my abilities. We have seen our classified business from an order book standpoint and from a sales standpoint growing faster than the corporation. If you go around the horn, I've mentioned in the past, we won a strategic program in Palmdale, where we're starting to see the benefits of multiple customers starting to -- want that system. In fact, we're also in conversation with international partner of the United States of their interest in that system and back to Mike's question, that's the reason for the capital growth out in Palmdale. There is some other things going on out there that unfortunately we can't talk about that. I think we'll reap the benefits of some of them are hypersonics, some of them are other platforms. And missiles and fire control, we've talked about the large development program that we won. It is progressing well, it's going to continue to grow in the future. Probably as fast, if not faster than the rest of missiles and fire control. And then, probably the other big place to talk is space. We won a couple rather large strategic programs in 2020, we're also pursuing a few in 2021. And also the -- from a sales standpoint, as I mentioned it for across the corporation growing faster than top line than our business in the aggregate it is. From a margin standpoint, margins in aeronautics for Palmdale the classified work right now is dilutive just by the nature of the contract types. Same with missiles and fire control, these programs are going to be dilutive -- growing faster than the rest of the portfolio, but from a margin standpoint, going to be dilutive. The good news also is, but from a contract type standpoint, they're not an impact to working capital. So there'll be a reasonably good cash flow. In the space business, some of these programs are fixed price. But most of them are going to be cost plus as well, so just slightly took dilutive to the overall portfolio. But again, I apologize that's about as much as I could say about the portfolio.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. Jim, a question for you. Given the recent share price performance and the valuation on the stock. And of course, a very low interest rates here. Do you think is the best use of the balance sheet to continue to pile up more cash and perhaps you should be more aggressive on the share buyback here?\nJim Taiclet: Well, we are balanced in our cash application and always have been as a company and it's my legacy back at my prior company as well. And there are many competing parts, right? So we have an opportunity to say and a desire to grow and we're pursuing that growth strategy while carrying for cash deployment to shareholders. So again to be a little cryptic, we've got all the keys on the piano at our disposal. And we're going to work our way through some decisions and opportunities here in the near future. But yes, I may accolade of the notion that when share prices below intrinsic value that you aggressively to the extent that you can, buy it back based on regulatory and other matters that go on. And so -- and opportunities that maybe being looked at or not and so, we'll work our way through all of those issues. But I can assure you that, if we're in the clear and intrinsic value is greater than the share price. You'll see Ken and I diving back in the market.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Good morning, Jim and Ken. Just give 3% to 4% EBIT growth this year versus 9% in 2020. How do you think about some of those drivers as it relates to your $9 billion OCF target in 2023? Is it sort of steady as it goes in terms of your earnings outlook? And then I guess the age old question of, is there an opportunity where earnings growth exceeds revenue growth going forward, given decelerating budget environment?\nJim Taiclet: Hi, good morning. I hope you're doing well, you and your family.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you very much.\nJim Taiclet: So yes, we see -- if you look at our cash and as you noted, we see 8.3 cash from ops in 2,187 before the tax impact due to R&D of -- in '22 and then $9 billion in '23. We see -- right now, we see margins pretty steady at 11%. So most of that is -- I've talked to Wall Street about our focus on cash, what we've called it is a culture of cash, where generally over the last couple of years, it's not just frankly a balance sheet, issue is not the finance community just to solve, it's the entire corporation. Where say production operations understands the consequences of making or missing deliveries and how that impacts cash. So we see more opportunities going forward, managing the balance sheet, specifically contract assets and inventory and ensuring that if they're going to grow, they're growing at the most efficient way possible. And then also, as Jim mentioned, we see opportunities. I'm not going to talk about specifically FMS, we're probably more direct government sales, where there is an opportunity for us to get cash advances. To answer your second part of your question. We do see some opportunity though to be better than 11% and that specifically our programs that will start to mature. Pick F-16, we're generally in the beginning of the production cycle again, we're going to deliver 8 airplanes in 2022 and then we will get up to significant double-digit deliveries in '23 and beyond. There is an opportunity for us to have margin improvement there. F-35, everybody wants to talk about F-35. We do still think there's opportunities there from a margin standpoint to production. We've talked to you about the PBLs concept to the performance-based logistics concept that we've had that we do think there's some margin opportunity there for industry. Assuming we perform, assuming we hit the critical service level agreements that we want. Hypersonics, we'll soon get out of development and hopefully go into limited rate production and production that will help us. All the helicopter programs that we've talked about, you'll start to see CH-53K moving at a development into production. Presidential helicopter of course is moving into production. You have combat search and rescue that are moving to production. There is just a couple of examples, Sheila, I think that will give us an opportunity to enhance our margin overtime.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDoug Harned: Thank you. Good morning. Jim, earlier, you said that the goal would be to enrich your platforms with Mission Systems content. And I have to say, this to me sounded like something I could have heard back in the Vance Coffman Norm Augustine days, something that didn't really work out well, because of DoJ concerns, DoD concerns. So now with the -- you're trying to do that. And then also you talked about the advantages you could get from the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition. And then Raytheon with the acquisition of Blue Canyon and that's -- they make buses that do work for you guys or else for here us for Northrop Grumman. I mean, are we seeing -- do you think we're seeing a different structure to this industry going forward with much more vertical integration? Can you comment on this from sort of a philosophical standpoint?\nJim Taiclet: Sure, Doug. I mean, if you go all the way back to the primary notion that we're back into a world of great power competition. It's important to look, I think beyond our own defense industrial base structure, but outward to those of the competitors, which are China, Russia, Iran and North Korea for example. And compare our capabilities in the -- if I mean, government -- comparing our defense industrial base capabilities to those of the peer group. How is China operate its defense industrial base, how does it organize it and what are the capabilities and velocity again that comes from that? And from that perspective, my view would be that vertical integration concerns from a classic antitrust perspective, are dwarfed by the lack of velocity and inability to integrate and added cost frankly that comes from the existing defense industrial based structure that stratified with the supply chain that's quite fragmented. I think it's better for the country and for the defense enterprise to enable industry to make logical proposals for bringing in Mission Systems, if you will, the supply chain that goes into major platforms, into a more integrated organization. So, I think that's the philosophical basis. On the other hand, we cannot predict the decisions of individual regulators and those coming into office. But I do think that it's critical that those decisions look through the lens of great power competition and how we compare to the defense industrial base certainly with China.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hi, good morning everyone. How much revenue is your hypersonics franchise generating in the 2021 outlook? And then how much revenue could your hypersonics franchise be generating closer to the middle of the decade?\nJim Taiclet: Okay Noah, I'll take that. You do like these long haul answer. So I'll do the best of my abilities on the second part. But if you look at our hypersonics portfolio through 2020, our total order book was north of $3 billion. We generated about $1.2 billion in hypersonics sales in 2020 and think of that is mostly development in cost plus programs. And actually we had a couple -- risk retirements at the end of the year, so our programs are performing. For 2021, Noah, the best of our abilities, right now we see hypersonics sales being about $1.5 billion and still dilutive margins just based on contract type and the type of work that's being done. We're going to have a handful of these programs will have first launch continued demonstration of capabilities this year and next year. And then, as I've stated in the past, you will start seeing some of these programs neck-down as you saw last year where we had one program terminated, but we actually saw the funding start to go to some of our other platforms. So for us really not a harm and intuitively made sense. So by the middle of the decade, it's conceivable that, that number could be closer to $3 billion. You'll start to see some of these limited rate production programs happening. Some of these programs will actually start going into full-scale production. So it's conceivable that our sales were more than double by the middle of this decade and also the contract type will start changing and they will either be fixed price incentive or fixed price contracts.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nRichard Safran: Jim, Ken, Greg, good morning. So, I want to ask you about the international. We've known the Trump administration went to extensive measures to promote US Defense exports. I'm just wondering, maybe could dovetail off to the comments you've made, coming from your government affairs people about the new administration. Do you see any changes with how the new administration is looking at exports. Do you think there's going to be continued growth there? And do you think this could be a benefit to you or to the international sales of air defense equipment?\nJim Taiclet: Richard, it's Jim. Again it's too soon to tell what individual policy makers are going to do since they haven't been named or confirmed in large part yet. But if you go back to first principles of the administration based on -- can they [indiscernible] our President Biden's campaign, jobs and economic recovery incredibly important to him and to his administration. And there are no better source of jobs and international military sales for this country and in large part, because these are tend to be engineering stem, high salary and the manufacturing jobs also high wage, reliable, dependable jobs with companies that have strong benefits, etcetera. So, if jobs in the economy are important, the promotion of international defense sales one would -- surmise, it would also be important. So from that perspective, I expect that we're going to get strong support, let alone from as I mentioned earlier, the interest and desire to have increased collaboration and cooperation with our allies. And as the next pilot myself, I can tell you that there is no better way to get a tighter bond with an ally and then sell them jet aircraft, fighter aircraft, because all the way back in the mid '80s, when I was in pilot training, we had Saudis in our class for example. And then, when I was at Pratt & Whitney, we build in F-100 engine overhaul repair shop in Saudi Arabia that further cemented our collaboration with that country, is just two tiny examples. And then you've got again the training, collaboration, you've got industrial collaboration, you're doing exercises together, you're using the same cockpit avionics. Just goes on-and-on, how you can increase your alliance stickiness if you will with major defense sales. So, I think on those two dimensions at least that we would expect some positive momentum.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. Just a quick one on space. It looked like there was some implied margin erosion or compression sequentially into 2021. But I would have thought that AWE would have helped that. Is there something else that moved around in the mix that you point us to?\nKen Possenriede: Sure. Hey Myles, it's Ken. Yes, the big driver is; if you look at United Launch Alliance. Due to the mix of launches, we're going to see less profit next year, a ULA then we had in 2020. But you're right, unfortunately that more than offsets the ULA. I'm sorry the AWE dilution.\nOperator: And we do have a question from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. I wanted to go through some of the margins [indiscernible] aeronautics. I mean you had to increase in C-130 profits and in look like revenues change much otherwise you would have spelled it out. And then you had a reduction in the F-16 margins and it looked like you had to have an increase in the production margin on the F-35 to get these big and increases you had. So I just wonder, if you could clarify that a little bit more?\nJim Taiclet: Hey George, I got a clarifying question for you. Talking about fourth quarter of '20 or you want to talk about '21?\nGeorge Shapiro: Talk about the full year 2020.\nJim Taiclet: Full year 2020. Well, it's probably just make sense than to talk about the fourth quarter, because that's the most current information. So just in aggregate, I'll talk top line and bottom line for aeronautics. So we saw a development top line increases. Generally, they were mid-single digit increases and that was driven by a follow on modernization. I mean, we're still seeing a lot of success there, a lot of demand by our customer set for increased technology on the platform. Production was down in the quarter, year-over-year in the fourth quarter, George and that was mid-single digit as well that was probably more of a timing issue than anything else. Sustainment, we saw a strong growth and we're going to see strong growth into 2021 that will be the fastest growing piece of F-35 in 2021. We saw strong increases at -- on F-16, you're starting to see production kick in and you also had strong sustainment. C-130 sales were up 3%. So think of that is low single digits. ADP, the skunk-works is strong double-digit increases there as well. And I'll go to profit for you, so for the quarter, we were up 7%, roughly 10.8 margins versus 10.6. But F-35 to your point was down. That was driven by production, so we had high-single digit margins. I mean it was almost 10%, but down a little bit versus last year, which were stronger double-digit margins and that was just frankly driven by a less risk retirements in the fourth quarter of 2020 than 2019. Sustainment was up a little bit, F-16 margins for the quarter George were up. Both were double-digit margins, but fourth quarter this year we are almost 20% margins on F-16. That's because we had a risk retirement on an international sustainment program, C-130 margins were up in the fourth quarter as well and that's because we had risk retirements in our FIAC programs. And ADP was up and most of that was volume, but we actually good news had some risk retirements there as well. So hopefully that help to give you some color.\nGreg Gardner: Hey Brett, it's Greg. Before I hand it off the Jim, I've been informed that some listeners might not have heard the forward-looking statement at the beginning, so Joe, let me just reiterate for a minute that statements made in today's call that are not historical fact, are considered forward-looking statements and made pursuant to the Safe Harbor provisions. So, please check our SEC filings for more discussion on these risks and historical facts. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jim for closing comments.\nJim Taiclet: Okay, great. Thanks. Look our business performed exceptionally well in 2020 under extremely difficult circumstances. And again, I want to thank the men and women of Lockheed Martin for stepping up to that. We delivered outstanding program execution and operational performance for our customers and strong financial performance for you the stockholders. So our robust backlog, our broad portfolio and our long-term strategic focus, have us well positioned for continued growth we think. So we thank you again for joining us on the call today. And we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. And that concludes our call today, Brad. Thank you.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T conferencing service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. And good morning, everyone. I hope you've all had a great start to the New Year and at this call, I find you and your family safe and healthy. Welcome to our fourth quarter 2020 earnings call. As we review our results, strategic new business activities, key accomplishments and our outlook for 2021. Before I begin, I'd like to take a moment to reflect on the loss of Michele Evans, our aeronautics business area leader, who passed away earlier this month. Michele dedicated 34 years of service to our company and touched the lives of countless people both inside and outside the corporation. I knew Michele for years and I can say that she was the life of strength and grace. And while we mourn our loss, we also are thankful to had her as part of our Lockheed Martin family, we'll miss Michele.  As we look back to the year from a broader perspective, 2020 introduced personal and professional challenges to each and every one of us. I'll begin my summary of Lockheed Martin's results today by thanking the men and women of our company and their families, for stepping up to deliver outstanding performance during extremely difficult time. It was through their dedication and commitment that we were able to drive operational and financial results, which not only exceeded many of our expectations, but also set records in several areas. The coronavirus outbreak remains an ongoing pandemic and we're continuing to take actions to mitigate its impacts. Vaccines are also becoming available to help combat this disease and we're hopeful for a return to a more normal business environment, as we progress throughout the year. Our dedicated workforce and our resilient supply chain continue to perform with excellence during these demanding times, supporting our global customers and their important missions and I'm very proud of their accomplishments. Moving to our results, we delivered another year of outstanding performance in 2020, strategically, operationally and financially. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide our full-year 2021 financial outlook. But I'd like to provide a few highlights from the past year. A period in which we set high watermarks in sales, earnings and cash from operations. First, sales and segment profit each grew 9% over 2019 and our 2020 earnings per share increased by 11%. We had a strong year of cash generation, achieving $8.2 billion of cash from operations, even after a $1 billion voluntary pension contribution and after accelerating payments to our supply chain to help mitigate COVID impacts. We are continuing this practice, prioritizing our vulnerable and small business partners. We recorded over $68 billion in orders in 2020, growing our backlog by $3 billion, resulting in a robust $147 billion year-end total backlog. These results reflect a high level of execution being achieved across the company, providing critical security and deterrence solutions for our customers. As we look to 2021, our broad portfolio has us positioned for continued growth in all four of our business areas. We expect our cash generation to remain strong and we plan to continue our balanced cash deployment actions, investing in innovative technologies and strategic opportunities to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities and still returning cash to shareholders. Turning to defense budgets. For fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act has been passed into legislation and the Department of Defense Appropriations were approved as part of the FY '21 omnibus funding bill. Both of these congressional actions adhere to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019, which established spending levels for discretionary, but defense budgets with a total fiscal year 2021 national defense spending target of approximately $740 billion. Also Congress passed $900 billion COVID relief package, which extended section 36-10 of the CARES Act to March 31, providing federal agencies the authority to reimburse contractors who are temporarily unable to work due to facility closures or other restrictions.  Lockheed Martin programs were well supported in the FY '21 appropriations bill with Congress adding funding of over $1.7 billion for 17 additional F-35 aircraft and other development and integration activities for the program. Adding nearly $900 [million] [ph] for 9 additional C-130Js plus support work for that airplane. And over $400 million for Sikorsky programs including additional CH-53-K and Black Hawk helicopters. And also the initiation of an 8 THAAD battery for the US Army. Turning to our portfolio, I would like to touch on several notable achievements, demonstrating our focus on strategic growth and operational performance. As we announced last month, we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne, an action that once finalized will bring long-term strategic value to our entire portfolio. As we commented then our 21st century warfare strategy includes enabling growth areas such as hypersonics, tactical and integrated air and missile defense and space systems domains. Aerojet's expertise in propulsion systems will benefit our existing hypersonic programs as they progress from development to production and will improve our tactical missiles and air and missile defense products, while continuing Aerojet Rocketdyne's legacy as a merchant supplier to the entire industry. We believe this combination will deliver innovations and improve efficiencies that will offer more timely and affordable solutions for all of our customers, including the Defense Department domestic manufacturers and our international partners and we're very excited about this transaction. Moving to the business areas. In aeronautics, our F-35 team finished the year strong, delivering a total of 120 F-35 aircrafts. Our aero production organization, our partners, teammates in the supply chain, all worked to overcome manufacturing issues introduced by this pandemic. We've now delivered over 600 airplanes since the program's inception with nearly 360 jets still in backlog and domestic as well as international opportunities ahead of us. Over 2/3 of the jets in the plan of record are still to be ordered. So the aircraft continues to perform well, it's operating from 26 bases and ships around the globe. And the Royal Australian Air Force recently declared initial operating capability in December. The seventh country to do so since the program began. Also in our aeronautics business, the US Air Force awarded $900 million contract for us to provide sustainment and support services for F-16 aircraft, including maintenance and modification activities. Of course, the F-16 is one of our longest-running production programs and we will look to optimize the Air Force's F-16 fleet for greater capability, readiness and performance via this new sustainment contract. Moving to our space business area, we recently won a $4.9 billion award for our next generation Overhead Persistent Infrared or OPIR contract. This award funds the production of 3 geosynchronous satellites and ground systems to provide initial warning of ballistic or tactical missile launches anywhere in the world. These new space vehicles will have more powerful sensors and greater resiliency to enhance our Nation's air and missile defense capabilities well under the 21st century.  Keeping with our space organization, we're pleased to be selected for one of the awards to develop a prototype payload for the new evolved strategic satellite communication systems. ESS is designed to be the successor to the Advanced Extremely High Frequency constellation satellites, one of our signature programs that provide secure and survivable strategic communications for national leaders and tactical commanders alike. This is our OPIR satellites, the ESS Constellation is intended to provide improved resiliency, survivability and increased capabilities. We look forward to participating in this opportunity as we work to enrich our platforms with more mission systems content, which is another key facet of our 21st century warfare strategy. I'll close with our Rotary and Mission Systems and missiles and fire control business areas, which recently led Lockheed Martin's participation in an exercise Valiant Shield 2020, which is a bi-annual joint effort for the US Navy, Army, Air Force and Marine Corps. Our combined team used virtualized Aegis weapon system to conduct a pioneering, joint multi-domain, long fires demonstrations. By delivering machine-to-machine interfaces across joint force systems, this effort accelerated speed of decision making and then the action. It demonstrated a primary premise of our 21st century war fighting strategy by networking separate sensors, communication links and weapons across multiple platforms. The result is more effective joint all the main operations that provides enhanced capabilities and greater effectiveness to the commander in a field of operations. This achievement highlight our strategy to help address emerging threats with 21st Century capabilities, to invest in new and innovative technologies and leverage our signature programs to provide powerful deterrence to future military conflicts. That's our mission and with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ron, I came into this role with Lockheed Martin being the leader in National Security Space, as it is. And the benefit of the position of the company is that we have a strong position in the -- I would say, classic large bus military defense satellites and intelligent community satellites. So we also have the ability to go down range into medium and lower, but as well as geosynchronous or and so. The whole playing field in national defense space is open to Lockheed Martin and what we're doing in the business is, we're introducing these 21st century technologies and taking advantage of that space platform. And so you see us winning recently a low orbit transport layer contract, which is a pioneering initiative of the Department of Defense to start introducing 5G and other modern networking technologies into the space domain, we're part of that. And what we've been able to do is to connect our space assets already using some of those newer technologies and AI and also distributed compute into our Aerospace, land and sea forces, as well the platforms that we deploy there. So we have a broad space strategy which is to take 21st century networking, storage and compute technologies into our space domain as really a competitive advantage versus other defense contractors that don't have that asset available to them. The second part of your question is, well how does Aerojet Rocketdyne create value in doing this? And it really goes hand-in-hand with our hypersonic strategy, which is part of our 21st century war fighting initiative. I view Lockheed Martin's benefit or role in defense enterprise is adding velocity to it. The world is moving faster, both kinetically if you will and in the networking and AI perspective as well and we need to speed up. And just taking one dimension of that hypersonic missiles and countering a hypersonic missiles requires a much better tighter integration of the propulsion system into the body of the missile. The heat generated by these hypersonic missiles is incredible and just managing that heat and thermal issue, is one of the reasons we invested in i3 as well. So, we are selecting what we think are the most important defense platforms and connectivity capacities for the future of warfare and we're investing in those. And Aerojet Rocketdyne is part and parcel of that investment strategy. Propulsion integration into hypersonic missile, glide bodies is essential. The other benefit of us working more -- in a more integrated fashion with Aerojet Rocketdyne is, we'll be able to bring our broad engineering expertise, our capital and our operational experience into Aerojet Rocketdyne and bring the best of Lockheed Martin to the propulsion side of missiles and space. So there are incredible synergies here, I know Ken can speak to a little bit more of on those later both revenue and costs, but given my long answer I'll stop there. Sure, Pete. The administration hasn't unveiled its actual plan or trajectory for defense budgets. But I take solace in a couple of things. One is that the national security and intelligence and international affairs team, President Biden is proposing has brought on is experienced, they are professionals in that realm of -- many of them having decades of senior government experience dealing with these issues and so you're going to have -- we believe a lot of continuity in policy and also in focus on how important strong defense is for this country. So I think the proposed team is a plus. And unfortunately, frankly the threat outside against potentially United States is growing. It's accelerating too by the way and when we look at the national defense strategy, it reorients itself and reorients our defense enterprise towards great power competition. And it's something you cannot just sit still and watch go by, because we will be overtaken because of the aggressiveness of our potential peers. So, I'm taking solace in these trends as far as the defense budget goes. That you have professional experienced people leading it for the administration and that threat environment is greater versus lesser, we feel that supports a stable defense budget going forward. Hi, Mike. Good morning, Kristine. As far as international business, including foreign military sales. The Tennessee -- the people in the Biden administration and the President's sound statements reiterate his view that alliances are important that they need to be cultivated and that they have real value and deterrence in National Defense. And so I do think that will have a more open environment for FMS and indirect commercial sales to our international partners. The other benefit you've seen it recently in the press is that, we have some fantastic an unmatched products that are in great demand and highly desired by many countries. So you've seen F16 sales coming back, F35 was a pivotal element of the Abraham Accords we believe. And that system is so highly desired by our allies in the United Arab Emirates and elsewhere that it actually helped putting a modicum of piece to the Middle East. And so our prop between our products and the Biden administrations stated proclivity to enhance our alliances, I think we're in a better position going forward. You bet. Hi, Carter and unfortunately, I do have to be a little cryptic and I apologize for that, but I'll try to give you color to the best of my abilities. We have seen our classified business from an order book standpoint and from a sales standpoint growing faster than the corporation. If you go around the horn, I've mentioned in the past, we won a strategic program in Palmdale, where we're starting to see the benefits of multiple customers starting to -- want that system. In fact, we're also in conversation with international partner of the United States of their interest in that system and back to Mike's question, that's the reason for the capital growth out in Palmdale. There is some other things going on out there that unfortunately we can't talk about that. I think we'll reap the benefits of some of them are hypersonics, some of them are other platforms. And missiles and fire control, we've talked about the large development program that we won. It is progressing well, it's going to continue to grow in the future. Probably as fast, if not faster than the rest of missiles and fire control. And then, probably the other big place to talk is space. We won a couple rather large strategic programs in 2020, we're also pursuing a few in 2021. And also the -- from a sales standpoint, as I mentioned it for across the corporation growing faster than top line than our business in the aggregate it is. From a margin standpoint, margins in aeronautics for Palmdale the classified work right now is dilutive just by the nature of the contract types. Same with missiles and fire control, these programs are going to be dilutive -- growing faster than the rest of the portfolio, but from a margin standpoint, going to be dilutive. The good news also is, but from a contract type standpoint, they're not an impact to working capital. So there'll be a reasonably good cash flow. In the space business, some of these programs are fixed price. But most of them are going to be cost plus as well, so just slightly took dilutive to the overall portfolio. But again, I apologize that's about as much as I could say about the portfolio. Well, we are balanced in our cash application and always have been as a company and it's my legacy back at my prior company as well. And there are many competing parts, right? So we have an opportunity to say and a desire to grow and we're pursuing that growth strategy while carrying for cash deployment to shareholders. So again to be a little cryptic, we've got all the keys on the piano at our disposal. And we're going to work our way through some decisions and opportunities here in the near future. But yes, I may accolade of the notion that when share prices below intrinsic value that you aggressively to the extent that you can, buy it back based on regulatory and other matters that go on. And so -- and opportunities that maybe being looked at or not and so, we'll work our way through all of those issues. But I can assure you that, if we're in the clear and intrinsic value is greater than the share price. You'll see Ken and I diving back in the market. Hi, good morning. I hope you're doing well, you and your family. So yes, we see -- if you look at our cash and as you noted, we see 8.3 cash from ops in 2,187 before the tax impact due to R&D of -- in '22 and then $9 billion in '23. We see -- right now, we see margins pretty steady at 11%. So most of that is -- I've talked to Wall Street about our focus on cash, what we've called it is a culture of cash, where generally over the last couple of years, it's not just frankly a balance sheet, issue is not the finance community just to solve, it's the entire corporation. Where say production operations understands the consequences of making or missing deliveries and how that impacts cash. So we see more opportunities going forward, managing the balance sheet, specifically contract assets and inventory and ensuring that if they're going to grow, they're growing at the most efficient way possible. And then also, as Jim mentioned, we see opportunities. I'm not going to talk about specifically FMS, we're probably more direct government sales, where there is an opportunity for us to get cash advances. To answer your second part of your question. We do see some opportunity though to be better than 11% and that specifically our programs that will start to mature. Pick F-16, we're generally in the beginning of the production cycle again, we're going to deliver 8 airplanes in 2022 and then we will get up to significant double-digit deliveries in '23 and beyond. There is an opportunity for us to have margin improvement there. F-35, everybody wants to talk about F-35. We do still think there's opportunities there from a margin standpoint to production. We've talked to you about the PBLs concept to the performance-based logistics concept that we've had that we do think there's some margin opportunity there for industry. Assuming we perform, assuming we hit the critical service level agreements that we want. Hypersonics, we'll soon get out of development and hopefully go into limited rate production and production that will help us. All the helicopter programs that we've talked about, you'll start to see CH-53K moving at a development into production. Presidential helicopter of course is moving into production. You have combat search and rescue that are moving to production. There is just a couple of examples, Sheila, I think that will give us an opportunity to enhance our margin overtime. Sure, Doug. I mean, if you go all the way back to the primary notion that we're back into a world of great power competition. It's important to look, I think beyond our own defense industrial base structure, but outward to those of the competitors, which are China, Russia, Iran and North Korea for example. And compare our capabilities in the -- if I mean, government -- comparing our defense industrial base capabilities to those of the peer group. How is China operate its defense industrial base, how does it organize it and what are the capabilities and velocity again that comes from that? And from that perspective, my view would be that vertical integration concerns from a classic antitrust perspective, are dwarfed by the lack of velocity and inability to integrate and added cost frankly that comes from the existing defense industrial based structure that stratified with the supply chain that's quite fragmented. I think it's better for the country and for the defense enterprise to enable industry to make logical proposals for bringing in Mission Systems, if you will, the supply chain that goes into major platforms, into a more integrated organization. So, I think that's the philosophical basis. On the other hand, we cannot predict the decisions of individual regulators and those coming into office. But I do think that it's critical that those decisions look through the lens of great power competition and how we compare to the defense industrial base certainly with China. Okay Noah, I'll take that. You do like these long haul answer. So I'll do the best of my abilities on the second part. But if you look at our hypersonics portfolio through 2020, our total order book was north of $3 billion. We generated about $1.2 billion in hypersonics sales in 2020 and think of that is mostly development in cost plus programs. And actually we had a couple -- risk retirements at the end of the year, so our programs are performing. For 2021, Noah, the best of our abilities, right now we see hypersonics sales being about $1.5 billion and still dilutive margins just based on contract type and the type of work that's being done. We're going to have a handful of these programs will have first launch continued demonstration of capabilities this year and next year. And then, as I've stated in the past, you will start seeing some of these programs neck-down as you saw last year where we had one program terminated, but we actually saw the funding start to go to some of our other platforms. So for us really not a harm and intuitively made sense. So by the middle of the decade, it's conceivable that, that number could be closer to $3 billion. You'll start to see some of these limited rate production programs happening. Some of these programs will actually start going into full-scale production. So it's conceivable that our sales were more than double by the middle of this decade and also the contract type will start changing and they will either be fixed price incentive or fixed price contracts. Richard, it's Jim. Again it's too soon to tell what individual policy makers are going to do since they haven't been named or confirmed in large part yet. But if you go back to first principles of the administration based on -- can they [indiscernible] our President Biden's campaign, jobs and economic recovery incredibly important to him and to his administration. And there are no better source of jobs and international military sales for this country and in large part, because these are tend to be engineering stem, high salary and the manufacturing jobs also high wage, reliable, dependable jobs with companies that have strong benefits, etcetera. So, if jobs in the economy are important, the promotion of international defense sales one would -- surmise, it would also be important. So from that perspective, I expect that we're going to get strong support, let alone from as I mentioned earlier, the interest and desire to have increased collaboration and cooperation with our allies. And as the next pilot myself, I can tell you that there is no better way to get a tighter bond with an ally and then sell them jet aircraft, fighter aircraft, because all the way back in the mid '80s, when I was in pilot training, we had Saudis in our class for example. And then, when I was at Pratt & Whitney, we build in F-100 engine overhaul repair shop in Saudi Arabia that further cemented our collaboration with that country, is just two tiny examples. And then you've got again the training, collaboration, you've got industrial collaboration, you're doing exercises together, you're using the same cockpit avionics. Just goes on-and-on, how you can increase your alliance stickiness if you will with major defense sales. So, I think on those two dimensions at least that we would expect some positive momentum. Hey George, I got a clarifying question for you. Talking about fourth quarter of '20 or you want to talk about '21? Full year 2020. Well, it's probably just make sense than to talk about the fourth quarter, because that's the most current information. So just in aggregate, I'll talk top line and bottom line for aeronautics. So we saw a development top line increases. Generally, they were mid-single digit increases and that was driven by a follow on modernization. I mean, we're still seeing a lot of success there, a lot of demand by our customer set for increased technology on the platform. Production was down in the quarter, year-over-year in the fourth quarter, George and that was mid-single digit as well that was probably more of a timing issue than anything else. Sustainment, we saw a strong growth and we're going to see strong growth into 2021 that will be the fastest growing piece of F-35 in 2021. We saw strong increases at -- on F-16, you're starting to see production kick in and you also had strong sustainment. C-130 sales were up 3%. So think of that is low single digits. ADP, the skunk-works is strong double-digit increases there as well. And I'll go to profit for you, so for the quarter, we were up 7%, roughly 10.8 margins versus 10.6. But F-35 to your point was down. That was driven by production, so we had high-single digit margins. I mean it was almost 10%, but down a little bit versus last year, which were stronger double-digit margins and that was just frankly driven by a less risk retirements in the fourth quarter of 2020 than 2019. Sustainment was up a little bit, F-16 margins for the quarter George were up. Both were double-digit margins, but fourth quarter this year we are almost 20% margins on F-16. That's because we had a risk retirement on an international sustainment program, C-130 margins were up in the fourth quarter as well and that's because we had risk retirements in our FIAC programs. And ADP was up and most of that was volume, but we actually good news had some risk retirements there as well. So hopefully that help to give you some color. Okay, great. Thanks. Look our business performed exceptionally well in 2020 under extremely difficult circumstances. And again, I want to thank the men and women of Lockheed Martin for stepping up to that. We delivered outstanding program execution and operational performance for our customers and strong financial performance for you the stockholders. So our robust backlog, our broad portfolio and our long-term strategic focus, have us well positioned for continued growth we think. So we thank you again for joining us on the call today. And we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. And that concludes our call today, Brad. Thank you."

            "name": "Ken Possenriede",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share from continuing operations close with a record annual highs. We generated $8.2 billion of cash from operations after a $1 billion discretionary contribution to our pension trust this quarter and we continued our cash deployment actions, returning $3.9 billion of cash to our shareholders for a combination of dividend and share repurchases. While continuing to invest in the strategic growth of the business, including acquiring i3 and record investments in IRAD and capital expenditures. We also entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aerojet Rocketdyne in the fourth quarter with the close expected in the second half of 2021. I will note that our 2021 outlook include -- excludes all results associated with this transaction. While backlog declined approximately $3 billion in the quarter due primarily to the timing of the F-35 lot 15 production order, 2020 represented the sixth consecutive annual increase in year-end backlog for the corporation. In summary, it was an outstanding year for the business and Lockheed Martin is well positioned for continued success in 2021. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 9% in 2020 compared with last year to $65.4 billion, continuing the strong performance over the first three quarters, while segment operating profit also increased 9% over last year to nearly $7.2 billion. On Chart 5, we compare sales by business area with last year's results. As Jim mentioned, all four of our business areas experienced strong sales growth in 2020 led by aeronautics and missiles and fire control at 11%. Aeronautics growth was driven by development and sustainment increases on F-35 and F-16 as well as growth in advanced development programs. Missiles and fire controls growth was primarily from production volume in Tactical Strike Missiles and air and missile defense lines of business. I will note that all four of our business areas achieved record highs for sales in 2020. Chart 6 shows our earnings per share for 2020. Our EPS from continuing operations of $24.50 was up $2.55 or 12% higher than our results from last year, driven primarily by increased volume and sustained performance. On Chart 7, we'll discuss our backlog. Driven by annual increases at three of our four business areas, we maintained a book to bill ratio above one for the full year of 2020. This continued backlog growth combined with further visibility of our 2021 orders, provides additional confidence in our increased sales outlook for 2021. On Chart 8, we'll discuss the cash return to our shareholders in 2020. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $8.2 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was greater than $6.4 billion nearly a 6% increase over to 2019. This growth was achieved despite accelerating more payments to our supply chain and we received from the favorable DoD initiated progress payment increases and the deferral of payroll taxes under the CARES Act. We increased our dividend by more than 8% and executed our planned share repurchases for the year with $1.1 billion in total shares retired. This brought our total cash returned to shareholders to $3.9 billion for the year or 60% of free cash flow providing a solid returns to the shareholders in 2020. Moving on to Chart 9. We provide our outlook for the year ahead. Our outlook for sales ranges from $67.1 billion to $68.5 billion. The midpoint of this range represents nearly a 4% increase over 2020 and improving from our October estimate, even after incorporating the impact of the UK March decision to insource contract support for the atomic weapons establishment. The $700 million sales reduction for this change is reflected in our outlook for the space business. We're not for this decision, our estimated sales increase would have been approximately 5%, which is greater than the estimated 3% sales growth we discussed in the last earnings call. We have incorporated the known COVID impacts into our 2021 financial outlook. We will continue to work with our US government customers to monitor COVID risk to our operations in the supply chain and we will continue exploring potential path to recovery of cost impacts, where appropriate to minimize future impacts. The range for segment operating profit is estimated to be approximately $7.4 billion to $7.5 billion. Our estimated FAS, CAS pension adjustment is approximately $2.3 billion. Our estimated range for 2021 earnings per share grows to between $26 to $26.30. The midpoint of this range represents approximately an 8% increase over 2020 results. Cash from operations is now projected to meet or exceed $8.3 billion and I will discuss this in greater detail on the following chart. On Chart 10, we will walk through our future cash expectations, folding in the $1 billion discretionary pension payment we made last quarter. Strong operational performance drove a reduction in working capital, which allowed us to increase our cash outlook for 2021 to greater than or equal to $8.3 billion. We now see approximately $8.7 billion of cash flow from operations in 2022, increasing our three-year cash generation estimate by $900 million over our prior assessment. And as we sit here now, we see 2023 cash from operations of approximately $9 billion. I should know this outlook and trends are prior to an estimated R&D tax deduction impact from the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act change that would impact 2022 cash by approximately $2.1 billion and lower 2023 cash by approximately $1.8 billion. On Chart 11, we break down our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area. All four business areas are positioned for continued sales growth in 2021, approximately 4% for the corporation, led by aeronautics at 5%. Segment operating profit growth is also projected to grow at approximately 4% into aggregate with our largest growth in Aeronautics at 6%. And finally on Chart 12 we have our summary. We believe 2020 was an exceptional year for Lockheed Martin during these challenging times. Our team diligently work to minimize the impacts of the pandemic to our business and our supply chain. We have increased our estimates for 2021 for all key financial metrics. Our results in 2020 exceed the previous highs and have positioned us well for continued growth and value creation this upcoming year. We remain focused on cash generation and growth in 2021, we will continue to invest in discriminating technologies and strategic initiatives to deliver value to our customers, while providing strong cash returns to stockholders. And with that, we're ready for your questions. Brad? You bet. So yes, Joe, I have socialized with you guys as much as we could, once we concluded our view of what the tax law, the interpretation that was and as I stated a few times now it looks like it's about $2.1 billion in 2022, $1.8 billion in 2023 and it will continue trending down. One of the reasons we are extremely focused on cash, you heard in my prepared comments, the amount of cash that we're generating in '22 and '23. I've stated we've taken -- we took a pause for that roughly the second half of last year, before we started talking to the key constituents about that impact. It is still our belief that we think there is some likelihood it will either be repealed or altered, so it just doesn't include entire research expenses, which would include our cost-plus contracts. But would be just our research in our IRAD, our research and development costs, which would not be a material impact to our -- to the outlooks I gave you. We still think there is a good likelihood that's going to happen. Because if you think about it, if -- in 2022, we have $2.1 billion less of cash this is just Lockheed Martin and as you know Joe, this is not just Lockheed Martin and not just A&D, this is all of industry. So this is going to hit pharma hard, it's going to hit high-tech hard. These are dollars that we're not going to have the ability to plow back and invest into our portfolio and into our technologies. And I think that is a compelling story and I think at the end of the day, that's going to rule the day. Now having said that, we are still generating large amounts of cash. In fact, as you know, we ended the year in excess of $3 billion cash on hand. Right now assuming our dividend assumptions and our share repurchase assumptions for 2021, we're going to end 2021 with over $5 billion of cash. That number is going to continue to grow. And that frankly, that's a good opportunity for us to do the things Jim described from an investment standpoint and then to continue our robust cash deployment strategy that we have historically had with our shareholders. Yes, thanks for the question, Mike. It's Ken. So I think this year or 2020, we're going to end with roughly 72 million square feet and there's four pieces to that. One is, the space we actually own and a large share of that is going to be manufacturing space and that's about half of our real estate. And then the other half is a combination of leased space. GOCO, which is government owned contract or operated much like our Fort Worth facility and then GOGO, which is government owned government operated, which is AWE. And so there is a couple of just short term, there's a couple of puts it takes. Assuming the UK government does take over the management of AWE, we lose about 4.5 million square feet out of that 72 million squares. When we're successful with the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition, I believe they have about 3 million square feet that we would add back. You mentioned Mike, the Palmdale building that we're building, we also have a little bit of real estate that we're expanding in space and in RMS and in missiles and fire control and that nets about 1 million square feet. So at the end of the day, we're going to be down about a 0.5 million squares. But now the opportunity comes, right now we have roughly half of our employees working remotely. Some of them are periodically coming in, but we have over the last couple of months have rolled out a plan. Frankly looking at Lockheed Martin forward is what we call-in and it's frankly the future of work. And we are going to start looking at, getting out of some of that leased space as our leases expire, you can expect us to reduce our foot print by at least a couple of million square feet in the next couple of years, if not more. We will go to more hoteling, we will allow people that where it makes sense for them to work from home and we'll make sure this is a competitive and strategic advantage for us. Sure. Hey Myles, it's Ken. Yes, the big driver is; if you look at United Launch Alliance. Due to the mix of launches, we're going to see less profit next year, a ULA then we had in 2020. But you're right, unfortunately that more than offsets the ULA. I'm sorry the AWE dilution."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome everyone to the Lockheed Martin Third Quarter 2020 Earnings Results Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, sir.\nGreg Gardner: Thank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our third quarter 2020 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Possenriede, our Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical fact are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Federal Securities Law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter 2020 earnings call, as we review our financial and operational results, highlight some of our key accomplishments, and discuss our updated outlook for 2020 and trend information for 2021. I do hope this call finds you and your family safe and healthy. The coronavirus outbreak remains an ongoing global pandemic, and we're all working to mitigate its impacts. Our priorities at Lockheed Martin remain ensuring the health and welfare of our employees and their families, continuing to perform and deliver for our customers and our national security and using our resources and leadership as a company to assist our communities, our country, and our allies. We are continuing to take actions to address issues brought on by this virus: maintaining robust health and safety protocols in the workplace, delivering personal protective equipment to frontline workers, and donating over $20 million to COVID-19 charities. We have continued expediting payments to our supply chain and have hired over 12,000 employees since the pandemic began. I thank all of the men and women of Lockheed Martin for their dedication and commitment during these trying times as they perform with excellence for our customers and their important missions. I'd also like to take a moment to express my sincere sympathies to those across our nation affected by the recent hurricane and wildfire disasters. We hope that our employees and other citizens of the affected communities recover quickly from the devastation caused by these events. Moving to Lockheed Martin's results, as our press release illustrates, we delivered another strong quarter across the board financially, strategically, and operationally. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide preliminary trending data for 2021, but I'd like to begin by providing a few financial highlights from the quarter. Sales this quarter were a record and exceeded last year's third quarter by 9%. Year-to-date, we are 10% over our 2019 results. Our business areas grew segment profit by 6% over the 2019 third quarter and year-to-date were 7% over 2019. We had a strong quarter of cash generation, achieving $1.9 billion of cash from operations. We now have brought in nearly $6.4 billion of operating cash year-to-date, keeping us on pace to deliver at least $8 billion in cash from operations in 2020. We won approximately $17 billion in orders, resulting in another high watermark for our backlog and our ninth consecutive quarter of backlog growth. And in cash deployment actions during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of over 8% to $2.60 per share and $10.40 annually. Providing outstanding returns to shareholders through a strong dividend remains our cash deployment priority, and this action marks the 19th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend. Our outstanding year-to-date results and record backlog enabled us to again increase our full year 2020 outlook for sales, operating profit, and earnings per share. Our team continues to deliver exceptional performance and operating results with a portfolio that is well aligned to our customers' priorities. Turning briefly to budgets. You'll recall that the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 was enacted into law last year and established spending levels for discretionary defense budgets, with a total fiscal year 2021 national defense spending target of approximately $740 billion. Lawmakers continue to work on authorization and appropriations bills, and in the interim the federal government is operating under a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2021 through December 11. While we do not expect impacts to our 2020 financials should the continuing resolution be extended beyond December 11, 2020, we could experience some level of impact to our 2021 trending data depending on the duration of the CR. Similarly, Section 3610 of the CARES Act, which was passed in March to provide authorization for federal contractors continuing to support government initiatives despite COVID-19 disruption was also extended through December 11. To-date, no additional funding has been provided for issues introduced by the coronavirus. As with the DoD appropriations bill, we do not anticipate a material impact to our 2020 financial results should a delay in CARES Act funding continue, and we remain engaged in discussions with the Defense Department regarding a macro settlement for issues caused by the virus. Turning to our portfolio. I'd like to highlight a few of our notable strategic achievements that demonstrate the solid demand for our signature platforms and their relevancy to next-generation, war-fighting capabilities. In our Aeronautics business area, the Department of Defense announced a foreign military sale for a total of 90 new F-16 fighter aircraft to the countries of Taiwan and Morocco. Aero received an award of nearly $5 billion, adding to recent orders from Bahrain, Slovakia, and Bulgaria and bringing the F-16 backlog to nearly 130 jets. This 90-airplane award is part of a new $62 billion indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, contract vehicle put in place to facilitate F-16 FMS sales to international customers, taking advantage of standardized contracting to expedite the process for future awards. And I can tell you, I flew a Block 70 last year, and it is an awesome airplane. Our Space business area was awarded a new contract that represents an opportunity to bring together an array of high-tech platforms into one cohesive network that spans every domain for unmatched situational awareness powered with 5G technology. Last month, the Space Development Agency awarded our team one of two contracts for approximately $200 million to develop initial data transport capabilities for the first generation of the National Defense Space Architecture. The award represents an important step toward building an interoperable, connected, and secure mesh network of satellites that links ground, sea, and air capabilities to sensors in space. The Space Transport Layer contract initiates the design and development of the system, the launch of a constellation of 10 small low Earth-orbiting satellites, and this network will be capable of sending and receiving secure wideband data directly to the war fighter and to weapon systems. This interoperability and interservice networking will communicate and analyze data seamlessly to enable a force multiplier that's flexible and formidable, so that those in battle can effectively perform joint all-domain operations. Future sensors, data collectors, and communication payloads can be incrementally added to this constellation to create a web that will link the most time-critical intelligence and tracking data. We are very pleased to be part of this opportunity and look forward to the launch of the satellites and the demonstration of the initial mesh network in just two years. In our Missiles and Fire Control group, our integrated air and missile defense team achieved two important mission success events. These demonstrated our commitment to innovation and a network-centric focus at Lockheed Martin. Most recently, we successfully conducted a test at White Sands, just after the close of the quarter, where a PAC-3 MSE missile intercepted an incoming target using location data provided by the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense network or THAAD weapon system. This demonstrated a critical capability to expand the defended area through integration of existing systems. In July, the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin together demonstrated the ability to integrate F-35 intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance track data with the U.S. Army's integrated Battle Command System, during an Orange Flag Evaluation near Edwards Air Force Base, California. This valuation just demonstrated the value of utilizing data from the F-35 to enable enhanced integrated air and missile defense such as PAC-3 engagements. This accomplishment is one of the first instances of demonstrating our 5G.mil concept. With the F-35's compute and data storage capabilities enabling that F-35 to serve as an edge node of a network-centric operational architecture. This concept and the ability to share data across platforms is another example of our commitment to adopting a joint all-domain operations mindset to maximize the collective value and power of our customers' highly capable assets and our platforms. Networking every sensor with every shooter across the services and across domains will provide real-time data to maximize the effectiveness of our total force. These few strategic highlights represent just a few of how we will pursue a strategy to help our customers meet emerging threats with 21st century capabilities as well as create a powerful deterrent to future military conflicts. We continue to engage industry as well as technology leaders from the commercial sector to explore collaboration and align technology road maps for transformational solutions for our men and women in uniform. With that, I'll turn it over to Ken.\nKen Possenriede: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share remain strong. And as Jim noted, we achieved record sales in the quarter. We generated $1.9 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our cash deployment actions in the quarter, returning $757 million of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In addition to these results, we again increased our backlog to $150.4 billion, representing the ninth consecutive quarter of record backlog. And based on the strength of our performance to date, we have updated our financial outlook for 2020 and are also providing our 2021 preliminary financial trends. Turning to chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the third quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales grew 9% compared with last year to a record $16.5 billion, continuing the strength we had in the first two quarters, while segment operating profit increased 6% over last year's level to nearly $1.8 billion. On chart 5, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS from continuing operations was $6.25, an increase of $0.59 or 10% higher than last year, driven by a $100 million increase in segment operating profit and additional FAS/CAS income, partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate. On chart 6, we review our year-to-date cash from operations. Through three quarters, our cash from operations is $6.4 billion, a 10% increase over the same point in 2019. This performance does include $1.4 billion of CARES Act benefits, which were more than offset by $1.8 billion of accelerated payments to our suppliers. Moving on to chart 7, we provide our revised outlook for 2020. With just one quarter left in the year, we are now providing point estimates of results for the entire year versus the ranges we have provided in previous quarters. We expect sales to be approximately $65.3 billion for the year. That's above the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. At $7.1 billion our forecasted segment operating profit is also above the high end of the guidance range last quarter, maintaining a 10.9% margin. This puts our sales approximately 9% above our 2019 results and segment operating profit approximately 8% last year. Our FAS/CAS pension adjustment remains unchanged at a little less than $2.1 billion. Earnings per share is expected to be approximately $24.45 above the high end of our previous guidance range driven by additional sales volume and the continued performance across our business. And cash from operations remains at greater than or equal to $8 billion, which assumes no contributions to our pension trust in 2020. Chart 8 shows our new outlook for sales by business area for the year. In total our point estimate for sales outlook is approximately $1 billion above the midpoint of our last guidance and that's driven primarily by Aeronautics. On chart 9 we provide a similar view of our new outlook for segment operating profit by business area for the year. Like our sales, segment operating profit is $150 million above the midpoint of the guidance range from last quarter and that's driven primarily by Aeronautics and RMS. On Chart 10, we provide a preliminary look at our 2021 trends. As we look ahead, we expect our 2021 sales to be greater than or equal to $67 billion, a 3% increase over our current outlook for 2020. We expect our segment operating margin will be between 10.9% and 11.1%, showing continued strong performance on our legacy programs in all business areas. And as you recall from last quarter, we expected 2021 cash to be at least $7.8 billion, including a $1 billion contribution to our pension trust. We are now pleased to increase that estimate by $300 million to $8.1 billion still including the same $1 billion pension payment. We also plan at least $1 billion in share repurchases, the same level as we anticipate in 2020 and that's more than offsetting any expected share issuances in the year. And additionally we have a debt maturity coming due next year of $500 million. Moving to our FAS/CAS outlook. We expect our net 2021 FAS/CAS adjustment will be approximately $2.1 billion and that's similar to the adjustment for 2020. This estimate assumes a discount rate at the end of the year of 2.5% or 75 basis points below the 2019 rate. And based on our performance to date, we are assuming a 7% return on our assets for 2020 and we are maintaining that same rate of 7% per year for our long-term asset return assumption. And finally on chart 11, we have our summary. We have seen growth and strong performance from all our business areas this year with increased backlog and sustained cash generation throughout the year. Our updated 2020 financial metrics anticipate strong full year results and we expect to see continued operational performance and increased cash flows in 2021. Based on our portfolio of legacy programs, new wins and strategic investments in key growth areas, we have continued to grow our backlog, deliver value to our customers and return cash to our stockholders. And with that, we're ready for your questions. John?\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen at this time, we are opening our lines for questions. [Operator Instructions] And first from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thanks so much, and good morning Jim and Ken.\nKen Possenriede: Good morning.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Revenues have grown 30% since 2017, and if we exclude the F-35, volumes are up 17%, so high single-digit growth per year. What programs or product areas do you think decelerate the most in your view from these high-single-digit levels to 3% implied trend line for 2021? And then is this something of a new normal we should be thinking about or do we transition from platform programs to less quantifiable opportunities that could reshape the growth curve? Thank you.\nKen Possenriede: Thanks Sheila. I'll tell you what, I'll kick it off and then I'll ask Jim if he's got some color at the end. So, it's probably best we start with how we got to this trend data. So, if you think of our planning process over the last couple of months, we've been going through our long-range plan, working with our business areas, and then working with the corporation on assumptions regarding tax or pension assumptions et cetera. We then review that with our Board, and it's primarily a reaffirmation of our 2020 numbers and then the long-range plan for 2021 through 2023. Do that in the late September time period. The quarter closes, we then do an assessment to come up with what we think our trend data will be. And I'll just remind everybody and we've said it in our prepared comments, Jim and I we did take our guidance up $1 billion for 2020. So if I could go around the horn. I'll do sales go around the horn, and then I'll give you some -- my perspective on some opportunities out there and then hand it over to Jim. So we start with Aero, and we look at 2021. Right now, we're seeing low-single-digit growth year-over-year for the portfolio. And specifically, if you talk about F-35, we're seeing growth similar to the overall Aero growth of low-single digits. Right now, we see production and development flat and we see primarily the growth coming from sustainment as our fleet expands. On F-16, we see solid growth as the program continues to ramp up production activities and also the modernization programs that we have going on at -- for F-16. Air mobility sales surprisingly are flattish. We've been talking about a slight decline, but they are stable going into 2021. And finally for Aeronautics, we do anticipate seeing strong double-digit growth at our Skunk Works, our classified Advanced Development Programs. We continue to execute on those recent awards. If I move on to Missiles and Fire Control, we're seeing low-single-digit growth there as well, and that's after several years of very strong growth as we approach production capacity on some major missile programs. Think of Hellfire and GMLRS. We're still seeing very strong demand there, but just year-over-year we see it being more flattish than not. Our growth is being led by our production programs, think PAC-3, which will be up double-digits. Precision fires will be up mid-single digits and JASSM-LRASM will be up double digits. That's partially offsetting some of the growth in our THAAD programs and that's just due to some procurement cost timing on a multi-year award. If I could move to RMS, we also anticipate low-single-digit growth there as well at least for now. At Sikorsky, we're seeing low-single-digit growth, and that's a reflection of the mix across our production programs as life cycles change. So think of the Combat Rescue Helicopter program and CH-53K, we'll see double-digit growth there as these programs ramp up into production, that\u2019s partially offset the growth at VH-92 as it ramps down and lower volumes on our Canadian military helicopter program, and the same with Black Hawk even though it's a strong contributor, and the top line year-over-year we'll see a modest decline. Within IWSS, we'll see a slight decline from 2021. Our Aegis franchise, however, will see high-single-digit growth and that's driven by international opportunities, so we're still seeing international opportunities there. Offsetting that growth, we're seeing reductions within our Radar business as the TPQ declines, while we await the next-gen programs. Think of Sentinel and TPY-X beyond 2021, and we're also seeing lower volume on our Littoral Combat Ship program in 2021. Nice surprise in RMS is our training solutions. We're going to see solid double-digit growth there driven by digital percentage of POT events in 2021 on an international pilot training program. And then finally Space, it will be -- right now we see it as our highest growth business area, mid single-digit range. Think of that as the strategic missile defense portfolio is expected to be up double digits. That's mainly driven by hypersonics programs and then also the anticipated next-generation interceptor award, and that's partially offset by the growth and reductions on our legacy MIL space programs, and predominantly think SBIRS, Advanced EHF, and GPS, they're all down mid-single digits due to program life cycle. So we'll go into January, we'll spend the next three months going through the second phase of our plan, and a couple of things before we give guidance, we'll see how we ended 2020, how we finish the year. We'll then reassess our orders plan for 2021 and adjust that accordingly and its impact that it has on our 2021 top line growth for sales. And then, we'll look at our backlog and look at the assumptions that our business areas are making of conversions to sales in 2021. And before I turn the call over to Jim, just some orders opportunities that are out there. We still see continued need and demand for additional capabilities on F-35 that ultimately down the road maybe not in 2021, but we'll see some growth there in the future. There are certainly other countries that have a keen interest in the F-35 from a product standpoint. So we'll see demand there. F-16, Jim mentioned the IDIQ contract, we received the first two countries that are part of that IDIQ. We see many opportunities out there for F-16, and the same with C-130. And then in the classified area of Aeronautics, there are a multitude of opportunities out there. In Missiles and Fire Control, we have TLVS. That's a future air and missile defense program for Germany. There's upside there for us. CH-53K in RMS for international. Of course, we've always talked about the Future Vertical Lift. And then in space, there's classified space. And then most of these are platform programs Sheila. There are others. We're looking to focus on our mission systems. Jim talked about the 5G work and the interconnectivity of our products solution for our customer, and I'll let him give some more color on that if he has it.\nJim Taiclet: Sure Ken. That was a great summary of some of the detailed line items that go into 2021. But Sheila, I would just add and extend from what Ken said on some themes for growth over the next -- not only the next year, but the next number of years. So the way I'm looking at it is that as Ken said, there's high demand for our signature products already both domestic and international whether it's F-35, F-16, CH-53K, et cetera. And we are going to drive some mission systems content into those as we move forward and technology, insertion and upgrades as was mentioned briefly. But those are some really big themes. We don't know exactly what customer and what order and what version they're going to be seeking and what the quarter, but I assure you these themes are going to continue. The next theme, I would offer is, there's some new technology ramps to production that Ken alluded to, but when we speak of hypersonics, I think there's a very big upside there, because there's a very big threat that's getting worse out of Russia and China and the U.S. and its allies are going to have to meet it both on offensive and defensive hypersonics systems, which I believe we're the leader here. The classified space arena is really a wide open field. Our Space business is again the clear leader in this area. And we're putting out some really fantastic products, I think that are unmatched in our industry. And then there's Future Vertical Lift as Ken said. And keep that in mind because as we go to network-centric operations, which I just alluded to a couple of examples that we've already implemented \u2013 as we go to that network-centric approach more widely, it's really going to strengthen our platform positions of those signature platforms. So think of Aegis, F-35, Future Vertical Lift, whether it's DEFIANT or not. Those are going to be the edge compute nodes of the future and the processing systems that act as the core network that tie it all together. So our platforms are extremely well positioned to actually implement the sort of 5G.military that we have that we're pursuing. And then there's going to be new revenue streams. I think as a result of 5G.mil and our kind of 21st century warfighter concept, and those could be inclusive of networking-as-a-service, more of a subscription model that we do on behalf of our customers. And then we do the upgrades and the comm layer and make sure we tie it all together just like you experience on your cellphone subscription. You don't know all the pieces that go into it. So every morning when you turn it on it works and it works with the latest applications and it works with the latest technology. So those are the kinds of things we're going to explore. It will take a little bit longer to get there but we're positioning ourselves to do that as well.\nOperator: Our next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. First one is just a clarification for Ken and your remarks on backlog. You mentioned some of the opportunities, but I didn't hear if you thought it would end the year flat up or down. And then Jim, if we take everything that Ken laid out from a cash and capital deployment with respect to the $1 billion share repurchase and then debt retirements about $1 billion a year, you'll have maybe $6 billion this time next year and a business that requires $1.5 billion to $2 billion on hand. So it's going to continue to raise the question of how you're progressing looking at potential opportunities, particularly in the M&A arena. So hoping you can give some perspective there as you've looked a little bit deeper from your time. Thanks.\nKen Possenriede: So \u2013 hey, Myles. Good morning. So first question on the backlog. We are right now planning on growing our backlog in the fourth quarter. There is one binary event that has to happen and that is the closure on Lot 15 production. We're in the midst of negotiations with the customer right now. I think there's agreement on both sides to try to get this done by year-end. But if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen and it rolls into next year. But if it does happen, we will continue the growth in the fourth quarter of backlog increase.\nJim Taiclet: And so Myles to speak to M&A approaches, I think we actually have to take two levels up and speak first to the strategy for the company. The executive team and I and the Board agree on what we call our 21st century warfighter concept, which has four pillars to the strategy. And I'll go through them really briefly. But first of all it's lead. We want to lead the acceleration of 21st technology \u2013 century technologies into the national defense space, not just by doing it ourselves but by teaming with commercial industry and things like AI, 5G, edge computing, autonomy, additive manufacturing et cetera. So we're planning to lead that acceleration into 21st century technologies. We're going to innovate as a second pillar internally along with that. So we're going to innovate in both the realms of science such as directed energy, hypersonics, I mentioned earlier, as well as in this networking innovation and bring capabilities to our platforms and frankly our \u2013 ultimately our competitors' platforms to be able to make them all more effective on behalf of our customer. The third pillar of all of this is driving operational excellence. And so that's really about while doing all this increasing Lockheed Martin's margins and ROI, while reducing the total life cycle cost for our customers because for them to afford what they need to do in the future our industry actually has to get more efficient at the same time. And then lastly, and this is where we get into more of capital allocation, we believe in this business and we're seeking to invest in it for growth. So growth of our asset base, our capabilities is sort of the fourth pillar and that's going to provide solutions to our customers that they're going to need in the future that we can't necessarily deliver today. So when we take those four pillars and say, okay, well what are we going to do with capital allocation and all that cash that this really fantastic business is generating as you said, it's really first of all to support our strong dividend. We're going to continue to do that. And secondly, we're going to keep investing in organic capital expenditures to build capacity to deliver on our core business. Much of what we spent this year is on classified programs in both Aeronautics and Space that are growing relatively rapidly. And so we're going to continue to do those organic investments every time we can. Thirdly, alongside those CapEx investments, we're going to invest in R&D to sustain our technological leadership. And again, both in traditional or defense-centric areas, such as hypersonics and also is more commercially introduced areas such as networking. So those are the first three: it's a dividend, CapEx and R&D. But we're also going to seek acquisition and joint venture opportunities to deepen our capabilities in things like mission systems, as Ken said, and to add technological firepower to our existing company. For example, we just bought a business called i3 that gives us a novel capability and thermal management for hypersonic glide bodies, which is something we wanted to bring in-house and again accelerate our own potential for developing that piece of the technology that's so absolutely critical. And so we're going to be looking for opportunities in the M&A space and the joint venture space and even partnerships that are commercial to thicken our portfolio and also to bring in the technologies faster into the company that we think are going to be crucial for the future. So we plan to be active but we also plan to be very, very prudent. In my last business experience, we were fairly active on the M&A front but we turned down actually quite a few more opportunities than we went through with. So we'll continue to have that discipline here at Lockheed Martin, but we do want to invest in this company and grow and use our cash flow to do that when we can.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rich Safran with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.\nRich Safran: Jim, Ken, Greg, good morning.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nRich Safran: So a space question with about three parts. Margins at Space were a bit weaker than I thought. And I'm guessing, there was an issue there at ULA. So I thought you might discuss that. Next, we're talking about 2021. I thought you might discuss the competitive dynamics in the Space business. Does SpaceX represent a challenge to your plans? And given the remarks you just made, do you think contested space is a growth area next year? Finally, here Jim, I thought you might expand on the opening remarks about the new satellite constellation. And if it's applicable discuss generally the long-term space opportunity set here? And if the 21st century warfighter program you just mentioned is involved.\nKen Possenriede: Okay. Hey, Rich, that sounded like a four part question. I'm not good at math. So, yeah regarding the margin reduction on Space. It's based on a couple of things. One, we had one less event on ULA. There was a slip in one of the launches. So that was the main driver. But you also had lower risk retirements on advanced EHF and fleet ballistic missile in 2020 compared to 2019. Regarding SpaceX and then I'll let Jim chime in. We at ULA \u2013 we Boeing and the United Launch Alliance leadership team we have seen SpaceX as an emerging threat. I mean, they are more than an emerging threat right now. But what I would say is of the recent competitions we've had with them, we've actually been pleased with the outcome of where ULA landed relative to SpaceX. So I think going forward, we're confident that we certainly have the mission capable abilities, but we also think we now have a price point that is compelling to customers that will allow ULA to get its fair share of awards over SpaceX. I don't know, Jim, if you want to talk about the next two.\nJim Taiclet: Sure. When it comes to test and space all I'll say is that, there are kinetic and non-kinetic emerging threats to space on orbit space assets and even ground stations and the links between them. And so as a prudent national defense, I think our government is going to need to understand and work with the industry on how to address those kinds of threats and so I'll leave it there. But those threats are emerging and they're becoming more material. When it comes to the new satellite constellation, this is to me coming from the telecom and technology sector, the real cracking open up the door of having a multi-layer, multi-lateral survival communications system that can enable a 5G.MIL concept that we're working with. So I think it was a real breakthrough for Rick Ambrose and his business to win a big part of that it's called the transport layer as I said. And what that does is put a low-orbit constellation similar to what you're hearing about in the commercial sector that we'll be able to transmit 5G speed, capacity and latency signals between really all domains now. So it'd be into upper space orbits down to aircraft in the air to ground troops and vehicles to ship-borne operations and theoretically and potentially even to undersea. So this transport layer is sort of one of the first elements of what we would envision in the future as 5G.MIL architecture and so we're right in the middle of designing that now with our customers. So yeah, it's an important piece. There'll be more competition. This will be a competitive space, but we want to get out in front of it. And I think the Space business area of Lockheed Martin gives us a huge advantage over really anyone else in taking the lead in this.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Can you hear me? \nKen Possenriede: Yes. Hi, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: Okay. Hello. Ken, I thought you had been pretty consistent for a while here that MFC would remain the fastest-growing segment of the company through \u2013 for a few more years. And you've just \u2013 recognizing that the dispersion of the growth rates you just guided to for revenue in 2021 by segment is pretty tight you didn't guide it to be the fastest-growing segment and it's a meaningful deceleration from 2020. So what's changed there if anything, or do you just have conservatism built into that? And then on the margin in that segment following that coming down for a few years now with the mix shift. Is that bottoming in 2020, or any color on the margin going forward in that segment would be helpful as well.\nKen Possenriede: You bet. Thanks Noah for the question. Yeah there's a couple of things. Let's talk top line, there's a couple of things going on. So as I mentioned, when Sheila opened up the call with the question on where we saw slowness of growth some of it is just \u2013 some of our tactical strike missile programs are at capacity right now. So think of Hellfire and GMLRS. You have a little bit of a timing issue with THAAD. But going forward, we see growth with THAAD. The growth opportunities for Missiles and Fire Control down the road will be PAC-3, and precision fires for the most part, because of the \u2013 they are not at capacity and we are seeing extremely strong demand internationally and domestically for that product. And what we didn't talk about in the development phase still is the large classified program that we have. We will start to see in the next four to five years that go into a limited rate production and then ultimately into production and you will see a large increase there as well. So I think \u2013 I think you see \u2013 I think you see at least in the short term some of the areas are going to be capped by capacity, but we'll work with our customer based on the strong demand that we see does it make sense for \u2013 to us to increase our capacity for say Hellfire\u2019s for example. Regarding margins, for 2021, we actually do see it's a slight decline to margins in 2021 and I do mean slight. And as we've talked about it before and I just mentioned it with that development program as it continues to grow at the topline, we'll see dilution there. That's the main reason. But -- so think of margins as a slight dilution in 2021.\nOperator: And next we go to the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nRon Epstein: Jim I just have a quick question for you back on the technology stuff. Back in -- it was a couple of weeks ago DoD announced their 5G experimentation and testing at five different installations. And I was surprised to learn that Lockheed wasn't part of that given what you've been saying lately. Can you talk about that like what you think about that? And is that an area that Lockheed would be interested in or is that just something that the company is not interested in?\nJim Taiclet: Well, there's two concepts around 5G. One is standard communications activity. So, terrestrial, if you will commercial communications. So, what is generally going on in the programs awarded that you're referring to is certain bases or ranges are going to have a standard terrestrial 5G implementation on those bases and ranges. That's not so much what we're interested in. We're interested in operationalizing the technical capabilities of 5G wave forms and technology software and hardware to improve our defense products and our defense products' performance in an inter-related way. So, that's a derivative of having the network in place. At a base level that's not going to really deliver what we're looking for. We need a global 5G connectivity platform and that's why space is so important an element of this. It's also why our airborne platforms will likely have a big role as well because we need edge compute nodes and edge transmission points to be able to get into battle outside of the bases if you will. So, we're really talking more about how do you go to war on a battlefield and bring with you and have available to you the throughput of data, the latency benefits, and the ability to do software-defined networks and manage spectrum dynamically on a battlefield. That's really what we're after and that will improve our national defense. \nOperator: And next we'll go to Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you so much for all the great information you're given us. So, cash flow, you expect cash flow from ops up $100 million next year even though it looks like you have a headwind in pension of about $1 billion, you have a headwind in terms of payroll tax deferrals looks like $500 million. Sort of what are the drivers to get you up? What's happening to CapEx? How much is that going to come down? And maybe give us some color if you could in terms of the relative direction in 2022. Thanks.\nKen Possenriede: You bet Cai. Good morning. Yes, so we've been embarking on what I'll call a culture of cash for quite some time now and we are actually starting to see the fruits of that effort Cai. And to your point what we're seeing in 2021 as I stated in my prepared comments I gave you all some color on 2021, 2022 on our last call. So, here's what we're seeing now. It's -- obviously the farther out we go the little less granular it is. But to the best of our abilities by doing long-range plan, balance sheets, and cash flow statements what we're seeing right now is as you stated $8.1 billion of cash from operations in 2021 which as we stated is $300 million above the outlook we talked about earlier. Right now we're seeing CapEx in 2021 at about $1.7 billion. That's fairly consistent with what we're seeing this year. And as you mentioned we've got the payroll tax holiday this year. It's a tailwind of $460 million. And we're also getting the benefit of about $750 million $800 million by the end of the year of the acceleration of the progress payment rate from 90% -- excuse me 80% to 90%. We are going to accelerate all of those benefits that we got from the government to our supply chain. So, we will be whole -- we'll have the government whole in 2020 with those benefits we received. So, we do have -- with that payroll tax we do have a headwind. 50% of that $460 million gets paid next year. So, that is a headwind. And then the other half gets paid out in 2022. As you state, we do have $1 billion pension contribution next year. In the following year, what we're seeing in 2022 is we now see a number closer to $8.2 billion. We gave you a little color in the last call. We were at $7.9 billion, so another $300 million improvement on cash from operations. We see CapEx today based on what we know today in terms of our capacity requirements and infrastructure builds and whatnot $1.7 billion in 2022. So CapEx will be roughly $1.7 billion from 2020 to 2022. And actually, I'll go out to 2023 we think CapEx right now is about $1.7 billion. So we have that other headwind as we mentioned on payroll tax in 2022, and we have the pension payment of about \u2013 it's about $1.7 billion out in 2022. So I think pre-pension payment our cash from operations right now in 2022 is about $10 billion. Now the only other wildcard in all this is we've talked about the change in the R&D tax assumptions where we're no longer expensing R&D out in 2022 and beyond. We're amortizing it. So that assumption would reduce our cash from operations out in 2022 by $2.1 billion. Out in 2023 we see cash from operations of greater than or equal to $8.3 billion so another $100 million increase from where we see 2022. I mentioned, our CapEx at about $1.7 billion. Right now, we're forecasting a pension contribution of roughly $1.7 billion. And the R&D impact goes down from $2.1 billion it will be about $1.8 billion out in that time period. So we have spent a lot of effort on our working capital improvements. And to be frank Cai, we think certainly in contract assets we have some opportunities still to hopefully improve these numbers.\nOperator: And our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDoug Harned: Thank you. Good morning.\nKen Possenriede: Good morning.\nDoug Harned: I have a two part question on the F-35. When you look at the President's budgets, they keep taking down numbers for the F-35 Congress keeps adding some back and at the same time you've got some growing international opportunities, which you've talked about. But those don't come immediately. So one would think a more stable trajectory would be helpful here. So how do you plan production around this kind of scenario? And as we see more growth coming from sustainment, how do you think that will affect your margin trajectory on the F-35?\nJim Taiclet: So I\u2019ll take that, Doug. Yes, so right now because of COVID impacts, we've started the year, roughly we thought we were going to deliver about 140 aircraft this year. They are predominantly Lot 12 airplanes, so that's the first lot of our block buy. So right now, the team is forecasting rough numbers 120 to 125. It's still a little bit in flux, but that's our outlook right now.  Right now based on what we're seeing and working with our supply chain and working with our production operations team, we're out looking roughly 140 aircraft deliveries out in 2021. We think based on the demand we have with Lot 12, 13, 14 and ultimately I talked about the Lot 15, production lot order that we're hopeful we'll get at the end of this quarter, we see about 169. So let's just round up to 170 aircraft delivered out in the 2022 time period. And then out in 2023, we see similar about 170 aircraft. That's basically predicated on the United States government program of record.  Earlier year, we had some to your point congressional adds, but we're not assuming any congressional adds at least today once you get beyond 2021. There is still pent-up demand with our partner countries, our FMS customers demand. And then as you stated Doug, out in that time period, there are other interests for the airplane with our partner countries, existing FMS countries and there are some new potential FMS countries that potentially will buy aircraft, but it'll be beyond the 2023 time period. So I think we have a pretty good handle out to about 2022, 2023 where we think our production is going to be.  Regarding margins, it really comes down to the PBL. Right now just based on how the customer is buying, sustainment they are, it is dilutive to the overall F-35 portfolio. Where we do see opportunities is in production. We do think if we continue to perform, continue to weed out inefficiencies and hopefully negotiate a deal where the customer rewards us for that. There is production opportunities, but it comes down to the PBL. And we do believe, we are starting to get more and more interest from the customer for a PBL or performance-based logistics concept and that would have us taking on investment as the industry taking on investment risk and it would then give us the opportunity assuming we perform and hit the service level agreements we'll sign up to -- for that to be margin-accretive. \nOperator: And next we'll go to Jon Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJon Raviv: Thank you and good almost afternoon. Question about sort of CapEx environment you're operating in. As you can see there's a lot of focus on your growth rates especially deceleration from 2020 growth to 2021 growth at least how you see it now. But at the same time, CapEx is remaining at this $1.7 billion level, you said 2021, '22 '23.  So even though there seems to be an assumption that growth rates and opportunities are slowing down you're still spending a lot more CapEx than you were almost ever. So how do we sort of square those two things? And is the industry or the customer I should say offering you enough certainty to be spending that CapEx such that you now have the long-term payoff that we're all looking for? \nKen Possenriede: Thanks. Hi, Jon. Almost good afternoon. So I'll -- it's Ken, I'll take that. So if you go around the portfolio, we are still seeing demand for CapEx. And then there's one point I'll make and I'll hand it to Jim because he may have a comment on this as well. But if you think Aeronautics, we have slowed down our capitalization spend on F-35 because of COVID. But if we're still going to ramp up to those higher quantities that I described when Doug asked me the question on F-35, we are going to have to still build out our capacity on F-35.  The same with F-16. Jim mentioned our backlog right now is 130 aircraft. We're going to deliver our first airplane roughly beginning of 2022. Rough numbers we'll do about eight a year. And then ultimately by the time we get out to the middle of this decade, we'll be delivering three to four F-16s a month. So we will have to build out that capacity.  And then we've talked about the classified win in Palmdale, we still need to build the building out there. And we are hopeful that performing on that program, there are other customers that have a keen interest in that program and that's one of the opportunities I talked about when Sheila asked the question. There are opportunities out there for us that just frankly aren't planned right now.  If you look at Missiles and Fire Control, we are still building out capacity for PAC-3 though we're not building it out for say Hellfire or GMLRS. We'll talk to the customer. We feel very good about the PAC-3 build-out for example. We do see opportunities for 500-plus PAC-3s per year and potentially significantly more than that. The question then is does -- is it the right time for us to continue building out in excess of the 500 per year that we are going to build out.  Space, we have the state-of-the-art Gateway Center. And there are some other opportunities out there where we have to spend capital. And then RMS, they've done a very nice job of portfolio-shaping. That is the place we really don't see a lot of facilitization or increased capital.  One thing Jim has tasked us on and we're in the middle of doing this not just for capital, but IRAD and then other investments are there low-hanging fruit if you will where it does it make sense for us to spend that capital or our IRAD. And then are there places where we should be investing regarding 21st century warfighter, the digitalization effort that we're trying to take on. So though we may stay at the same level, the balance or the mix of our spend may change over time.\nJim Taiclet: Just the one comment I'd add to that is, we are raising the capital expense decision-making process a level and we're going to be looking across all the business areas simultaneously and doing the rank ordering at that level, which will may result in some adjustments as Ken suggested. And also, I would highlight the digital transformation side of this which is both in the factory offices and functions. That's going to help us meet our customers' needs on one hand, but it's also going to help us improve margins on the other hand and be more efficient internally as we do all of this. So, there's investment upfront for that as well. But it's going to have a dual benefit.\nOperator: And our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. I think, Ken, you mentioned a little bit earlier the profitability expectation for Missiles and Fire Control in 2021. Can you just walk us through the other segments real quick?\nKen Possenriede: You bet. Thanks, Seth. I think, we're at the afternoon now. Yes so, at Aeronautics, we're actually -- we expect a slight improvement in margins from 2020, which we're very pleased with. F-35 margins and the balance of our compact -- combat air margins are expected to increase and that's consistent with our overall margins. And we expect fairly consistent margins in 2021 on air mobility. The combat air and air mobility margin improvements more than offset the dilution because you would expect just where the Skunk Works is that they would be dilutive. And I mentioned Missiles and Fire Control, so I'll move on to RMS. We're happy to see returns to double-digit margins this year and we expect a slight improvement in 2021 which we're very pleased with, so all that integration work that we've talked about. We talked about the portfolio shaping that we're doing at RMS. We're starting to see the results there. Sikorsky is the primary driver. They'll have year-over-year improvements on production programs. Think of those set as Blackhawk VH-92 and CRH. And then lastly at Space, we'll see a little bit of an erosion in margins in 2021. And that's very similar to Missiles and Fire Control. You're seeing dilution due to the OPIR development program and also increased development content at strategic missiles and missile defense portfolio. Think of that as hypersonics and then the next-generation interceptor. So, thanks for the question.\nJim Taiclet: So it's Jim. I'll end the session today by reiterating that Lockheed Martin completed another quarter of strong financial and operational performance. And with that robust backlog, focus on our program execution and strong demand for the portfolio of products and services we have -- we're positioned for a successful closure of 2020 and continued growth in 2021. So, thank you all again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call which will be in January. That concludes the call. John, thank you.\nOperator: Yes. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter 2020 earnings call, as we review our financial and operational results, highlight some of our key accomplishments, and discuss our updated outlook for 2020 and trend information for 2021. I do hope this call finds you and your family safe and healthy. The coronavirus outbreak remains an ongoing global pandemic, and we're all working to mitigate its impacts. Our priorities at Lockheed Martin remain ensuring the health and welfare of our employees and their families, continuing to perform and deliver for our customers and our national security and using our resources and leadership as a company to assist our communities, our country, and our allies. We are continuing to take actions to address issues brought on by this virus: maintaining robust health and safety protocols in the workplace, delivering personal protective equipment to frontline workers, and donating over $20 million to COVID-19 charities. We have continued expediting payments to our supply chain and have hired over 12,000 employees since the pandemic began. I thank all of the men and women of Lockheed Martin for their dedication and commitment during these trying times as they perform with excellence for our customers and their important missions. I'd also like to take a moment to express my sincere sympathies to those across our nation affected by the recent hurricane and wildfire disasters. We hope that our employees and other citizens of the affected communities recover quickly from the devastation caused by these events. Moving to Lockheed Martin's results, as our press release illustrates, we delivered another strong quarter across the board financially, strategically, and operationally. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide preliminary trending data for 2021, but I'd like to begin by providing a few financial highlights from the quarter. Sales this quarter were a record and exceeded last year's third quarter by 9%. Year-to-date, we are 10% over our 2019 results. Our business areas grew segment profit by 6% over the 2019 third quarter and year-to-date were 7% over 2019. We had a strong quarter of cash generation, achieving $1.9 billion of cash from operations. We now have brought in nearly $6.4 billion of operating cash year-to-date, keeping us on pace to deliver at least $8 billion in cash from operations in 2020. We won approximately $17 billion in orders, resulting in another high watermark for our backlog and our ninth consecutive quarter of backlog growth. And in cash deployment actions during the quarter, our Board of Directors approved a dividend increase of over 8% to $2.60 per share and $10.40 annually. Providing outstanding returns to shareholders through a strong dividend remains our cash deployment priority, and this action marks the 19th consecutive year that we have increased our quarterly dividend. Our outstanding year-to-date results and record backlog enabled us to again increase our full year 2020 outlook for sales, operating profit, and earnings per share. Our team continues to deliver exceptional performance and operating results with a portfolio that is well aligned to our customers' priorities. Turning briefly to budgets. You'll recall that the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 was enacted into law last year and established spending levels for discretionary defense budgets, with a total fiscal year 2021 national defense spending target of approximately $740 billion. Lawmakers continue to work on authorization and appropriations bills, and in the interim the federal government is operating under a continuing resolution for fiscal year 2021 through December 11. While we do not expect impacts to our 2020 financials should the continuing resolution be extended beyond December 11, 2020, we could experience some level of impact to our 2021 trending data depending on the duration of the CR. Similarly, Section 3610 of the CARES Act, which was passed in March to provide authorization for federal contractors continuing to support government initiatives despite COVID-19 disruption was also extended through December 11. To-date, no additional funding has been provided for issues introduced by the coronavirus. As with the DoD appropriations bill, we do not anticipate a material impact to our 2020 financial results should a delay in CARES Act funding continue, and we remain engaged in discussions with the Defense Department regarding a macro settlement for issues caused by the virus. Turning to our portfolio. I'd like to highlight a few of our notable strategic achievements that demonstrate the solid demand for our signature platforms and their relevancy to next-generation, war-fighting capabilities. In our Aeronautics business area, the Department of Defense announced a foreign military sale for a total of 90 new F-16 fighter aircraft to the countries of Taiwan and Morocco. Aero received an award of nearly $5 billion, adding to recent orders from Bahrain, Slovakia, and Bulgaria and bringing the F-16 backlog to nearly 130 jets. This 90-airplane award is part of a new $62 billion indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity, contract vehicle put in place to facilitate F-16 FMS sales to international customers, taking advantage of standardized contracting to expedite the process for future awards. And I can tell you, I flew a Block 70 last year, and it is an awesome airplane. Our Space business area was awarded a new contract that represents an opportunity to bring together an array of high-tech platforms into one cohesive network that spans every domain for unmatched situational awareness powered with 5G technology. Last month, the Space Development Agency awarded our team one of two contracts for approximately $200 million to develop initial data transport capabilities for the first generation of the National Defense Space Architecture. The award represents an important step toward building an interoperable, connected, and secure mesh network of satellites that links ground, sea, and air capabilities to sensors in space. The Space Transport Layer contract initiates the design and development of the system, the launch of a constellation of 10 small low Earth-orbiting satellites, and this network will be capable of sending and receiving secure wideband data directly to the war fighter and to weapon systems. This interoperability and interservice networking will communicate and analyze data seamlessly to enable a force multiplier that's flexible and formidable, so that those in battle can effectively perform joint all-domain operations. Future sensors, data collectors, and communication payloads can be incrementally added to this constellation to create a web that will link the most time-critical intelligence and tracking data. We are very pleased to be part of this opportunity and look forward to the launch of the satellites and the demonstration of the initial mesh network in just two years. In our Missiles and Fire Control group, our integrated air and missile defense team achieved two important mission success events. These demonstrated our commitment to innovation and a network-centric focus at Lockheed Martin. Most recently, we successfully conducted a test at White Sands, just after the close of the quarter, where a PAC-3 MSE missile intercepted an incoming target using location data provided by the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense network or THAAD weapon system. This demonstrated a critical capability to expand the defended area through integration of existing systems. In July, the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force and Lockheed Martin together demonstrated the ability to integrate F-35 intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance track data with the U.S. Army's integrated Battle Command System, during an Orange Flag Evaluation near Edwards Air Force Base, California. This valuation just demonstrated the value of utilizing data from the F-35 to enable enhanced integrated air and missile defense such as PAC-3 engagements. This accomplishment is one of the first instances of demonstrating our 5G.mil concept. With the F-35's compute and data storage capabilities enabling that F-35 to serve as an edge node of a network-centric operational architecture. This concept and the ability to share data across platforms is another example of our commitment to adopting a joint all-domain operations mindset to maximize the collective value and power of our customers' highly capable assets and our platforms. Networking every sensor with every shooter across the services and across domains will provide real-time data to maximize the effectiveness of our total force. These few strategic highlights represent just a few of how we will pursue a strategy to help our customers meet emerging threats with 21st century capabilities as well as create a powerful deterrent to future military conflicts. We continue to engage industry as well as technology leaders from the commercial sector to explore collaboration and align technology road maps for transformational solutions for our men and women in uniform. With that, I'll turn it over to Ken. Sure Ken. That was a great summary of some of the detailed line items that go into 2021. But Sheila, I would just add and extend from what Ken said on some themes for growth over the next -- not only the next year, but the next number of years. So the way I'm looking at it is that as Ken said, there's high demand for our signature products already both domestic and international whether it's F-35, F-16, CH-53K, et cetera. And we are going to drive some mission systems content into those as we move forward and technology, insertion and upgrades as was mentioned briefly. But those are some really big themes. We don't know exactly what customer and what order and what version they're going to be seeking and what the quarter, but I assure you these themes are going to continue. The next theme, I would offer is, there's some new technology ramps to production that Ken alluded to, but when we speak of hypersonics, I think there's a very big upside there, because there's a very big threat that's getting worse out of Russia and China and the U.S. and its allies are going to have to meet it both on offensive and defensive hypersonics systems, which I believe we're the leader here. The classified space arena is really a wide open field. Our Space business is again the clear leader in this area. And we're putting out some really fantastic products, I think that are unmatched in our industry. And then there's Future Vertical Lift as Ken said. And keep that in mind because as we go to network-centric operations, which I just alluded to a couple of examples that we've already implemented \u2013 as we go to that network-centric approach more widely, it's really going to strengthen our platform positions of those signature platforms. So think of Aegis, F-35, Future Vertical Lift, whether it's DEFIANT or not. Those are going to be the edge compute nodes of the future and the processing systems that act as the core network that tie it all together. So our platforms are extremely well positioned to actually implement the sort of 5G.military that we have that we're pursuing. And then there's going to be new revenue streams. I think as a result of 5G.mil and our kind of 21st century warfighter concept, and those could be inclusive of networking-as-a-service, more of a subscription model that we do on behalf of our customers. And then we do the upgrades and the comm layer and make sure we tie it all together just like you experience on your cellphone subscription. You don't know all the pieces that go into it. So every morning when you turn it on it works and it works with the latest applications and it works with the latest technology. So those are the kinds of things we're going to explore. It will take a little bit longer to get there but we're positioning ourselves to do that as well. And so Myles to speak to M&A approaches, I think we actually have to take two levels up and speak first to the strategy for the company. The executive team and I and the Board agree on what we call our 21st century warfighter concept, which has four pillars to the strategy. And I'll go through them really briefly. But first of all it's lead. We want to lead the acceleration of 21st technology \u2013 century technologies into the national defense space, not just by doing it ourselves but by teaming with commercial industry and things like AI, 5G, edge computing, autonomy, additive manufacturing et cetera. So we're planning to lead that acceleration into 21st century technologies. We're going to innovate as a second pillar internally along with that. So we're going to innovate in both the realms of science such as directed energy, hypersonics, I mentioned earlier, as well as in this networking innovation and bring capabilities to our platforms and frankly our \u2013 ultimately our competitors' platforms to be able to make them all more effective on behalf of our customer. The third pillar of all of this is driving operational excellence. And so that's really about while doing all this increasing Lockheed Martin's margins and ROI, while reducing the total life cycle cost for our customers because for them to afford what they need to do in the future our industry actually has to get more efficient at the same time. And then lastly, and this is where we get into more of capital allocation, we believe in this business and we're seeking to invest in it for growth. So growth of our asset base, our capabilities is sort of the fourth pillar and that's going to provide solutions to our customers that they're going to need in the future that we can't necessarily deliver today. So when we take those four pillars and say, okay, well what are we going to do with capital allocation and all that cash that this really fantastic business is generating as you said, it's really first of all to support our strong dividend. We're going to continue to do that. And secondly, we're going to keep investing in organic capital expenditures to build capacity to deliver on our core business. Much of what we spent this year is on classified programs in both Aeronautics and Space that are growing relatively rapidly. And so we're going to continue to do those organic investments every time we can. Thirdly, alongside those CapEx investments, we're going to invest in R&D to sustain our technological leadership. And again, both in traditional or defense-centric areas, such as hypersonics and also is more commercially introduced areas such as networking. So those are the first three: it's a dividend, CapEx and R&D. But we're also going to seek acquisition and joint venture opportunities to deepen our capabilities in things like mission systems, as Ken said, and to add technological firepower to our existing company. For example, we just bought a business called i3 that gives us a novel capability and thermal management for hypersonic glide bodies, which is something we wanted to bring in-house and again accelerate our own potential for developing that piece of the technology that's so absolutely critical. And so we're going to be looking for opportunities in the M&A space and the joint venture space and even partnerships that are commercial to thicken our portfolio and also to bring in the technologies faster into the company that we think are going to be crucial for the future. So we plan to be active but we also plan to be very, very prudent. In my last business experience, we were fairly active on the M&A front but we turned down actually quite a few more opportunities than we went through with. So we'll continue to have that discipline here at Lockheed Martin, but we do want to invest in this company and grow and use our cash flow to do that when we can. Good morning. Sure. When it comes to test and space all I'll say is that, there are kinetic and non-kinetic emerging threats to space on orbit space assets and even ground stations and the links between them. And so as a prudent national defense, I think our government is going to need to understand and work with the industry on how to address those kinds of threats and so I'll leave it there. But those threats are emerging and they're becoming more material. When it comes to the new satellite constellation, this is to me coming from the telecom and technology sector, the real cracking open up the door of having a multi-layer, multi-lateral survival communications system that can enable a 5G.MIL concept that we're working with. So I think it was a real breakthrough for Rick Ambrose and his business to win a big part of that it's called the transport layer as I said. And what that does is put a low-orbit constellation similar to what you're hearing about in the commercial sector that we'll be able to transmit 5G speed, capacity and latency signals between really all domains now. So it'd be into upper space orbits down to aircraft in the air to ground troops and vehicles to ship-borne operations and theoretically and potentially even to undersea. So this transport layer is sort of one of the first elements of what we would envision in the future as 5G.MIL architecture and so we're right in the middle of designing that now with our customers. So yeah, it's an important piece. There'll be more competition. This will be a competitive space, but we want to get out in front of it. And I think the Space business area of Lockheed Martin gives us a huge advantage over really anyone else in taking the lead in this. Good morning. Well, there's two concepts around 5G. One is standard communications activity. So, terrestrial, if you will commercial communications. So, what is generally going on in the programs awarded that you're referring to is certain bases or ranges are going to have a standard terrestrial 5G implementation on those bases and ranges. That's not so much what we're interested in. We're interested in operationalizing the technical capabilities of 5G wave forms and technology software and hardware to improve our defense products and our defense products' performance in an inter-related way. So, that's a derivative of having the network in place. At a base level that's not going to really deliver what we're looking for. We need a global 5G connectivity platform and that's why space is so important an element of this. It's also why our airborne platforms will likely have a big role as well because we need edge compute nodes and edge transmission points to be able to get into battle outside of the bases if you will. So, we're really talking more about how do you go to war on a battlefield and bring with you and have available to you the throughput of data, the latency benefits, and the ability to do software-defined networks and manage spectrum dynamically on a battlefield. That's really what we're after and that will improve our national defense. So I'll take that, Doug. Yes, so right now because of COVID impacts, we've started the year, roughly we thought we were going to deliver about 140 aircraft this year. They are predominantly Lot 12 airplanes, so that's the first lot of our block buy. So right now, the team is forecasting rough numbers 120 to 125. It's still a little bit in flux, but that's our outlook right now.  Right now based on what we're seeing and working with our supply chain and working with our production operations team, we're out looking roughly 140 aircraft deliveries out in 2021. We think based on the demand we have with Lot 12, 13, 14 and ultimately I talked about the Lot 15, production lot order that we're hopeful we'll get at the end of this quarter, we see about 169. So let's just round up to 170 aircraft delivered out in the 2022 time period. And then out in 2023, we see similar about 170 aircraft. That's basically predicated on the United States government program of record.  Earlier year, we had some to your point congressional adds, but we're not assuming any congressional adds at least today once you get beyond 2021. There is still pent-up demand with our partner countries, our FMS customers demand. And then as you stated Doug, out in that time period, there are other interests for the airplane with our partner countries, existing FMS countries and there are some new potential FMS countries that potentially will buy aircraft, but it'll be beyond the 2023 time period. So I think we have a pretty good handle out to about 2022, 2023 where we think our production is going to be.  Regarding margins, it really comes down to the PBL. Right now just based on how the customer is buying, sustainment they are, it is dilutive to the overall F-35 portfolio. Where we do see opportunities is in production. We do think if we continue to perform, continue to weed out inefficiencies and hopefully negotiate a deal where the customer rewards us for that. There is production opportunities, but it comes down to the PBL. And we do believe, we are starting to get more and more interest from the customer for a PBL or performance-based logistics concept and that would have us taking on investment as the industry taking on investment risk and it would then give us the opportunity assuming we perform and hit the service level agreements we'll sign up to -- for that to be margin-accretive. Just the one comment I'd add to that is, we are raising the capital expense decision-making process a level and we're going to be looking across all the business areas simultaneously and doing the rank ordering at that level, which will may result in some adjustments as Ken suggested. And also, I would highlight the digital transformation side of this which is both in the factory offices and functions. That's going to help us meet our customers' needs on one hand, but it's also going to help us improve margins on the other hand and be more efficient internally as we do all of this. So, there's investment upfront for that as well. But it's going to have a dual benefit. So it's Jim. I'll end the session today by reiterating that Lockheed Martin completed another quarter of strong financial and operational performance. And with that robust backlog, focus on our program execution and strong demand for the portfolio of products and services we have -- we're positioned for a successful closure of 2020 and continued growth in 2021. So, thank you all again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call which will be in January. That concludes the call. John, thank you."

            "name": "Ken Possenriede",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share remain strong. And as Jim noted, we achieved record sales in the quarter. We generated $1.9 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our cash deployment actions in the quarter, returning $757 million of cash to our shareholders through a combination of dividends and share repurchases. In addition to these results, we again increased our backlog to $150.4 billion, representing the ninth consecutive quarter of record backlog. And based on the strength of our performance to date, we have updated our financial outlook for 2020 and are also providing our 2021 preliminary financial trends. Turning to chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit in the third quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales grew 9% compared with last year to a record $16.5 billion, continuing the strength we had in the first two quarters, while segment operating profit increased 6% over last year's level to nearly $1.8 billion. On chart 5, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS from continuing operations was $6.25, an increase of $0.59 or 10% higher than last year, driven by a $100 million increase in segment operating profit and additional FAS/CAS income, partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate. On chart 6, we review our year-to-date cash from operations. Through three quarters, our cash from operations is $6.4 billion, a 10% increase over the same point in 2019. This performance does include $1.4 billion of CARES Act benefits, which were more than offset by $1.8 billion of accelerated payments to our suppliers. Moving on to chart 7, we provide our revised outlook for 2020. With just one quarter left in the year, we are now providing point estimates of results for the entire year versus the ranges we have provided in previous quarters. We expect sales to be approximately $65.3 billion for the year. That's above the high end of the guidance range we provided last quarter. At $7.1 billion our forecasted segment operating profit is also above the high end of the guidance range last quarter, maintaining a 10.9% margin. This puts our sales approximately 9% above our 2019 results and segment operating profit approximately 8% last year. Our FAS/CAS pension adjustment remains unchanged at a little less than $2.1 billion. Earnings per share is expected to be approximately $24.45 above the high end of our previous guidance range driven by additional sales volume and the continued performance across our business. And cash from operations remains at greater than or equal to $8 billion, which assumes no contributions to our pension trust in 2020. Chart 8 shows our new outlook for sales by business area for the year. In total our point estimate for sales outlook is approximately $1 billion above the midpoint of our last guidance and that's driven primarily by Aeronautics. On chart 9 we provide a similar view of our new outlook for segment operating profit by business area for the year. Like our sales, segment operating profit is $150 million above the midpoint of the guidance range from last quarter and that's driven primarily by Aeronautics and RMS. On Chart 10, we provide a preliminary look at our 2021 trends. As we look ahead, we expect our 2021 sales to be greater than or equal to $67 billion, a 3% increase over our current outlook for 2020. We expect our segment operating margin will be between 10.9% and 11.1%, showing continued strong performance on our legacy programs in all business areas. And as you recall from last quarter, we expected 2021 cash to be at least $7.8 billion, including a $1 billion contribution to our pension trust. We are now pleased to increase that estimate by $300 million to $8.1 billion still including the same $1 billion pension payment. We also plan at least $1 billion in share repurchases, the same level as we anticipate in 2020 and that's more than offsetting any expected share issuances in the year. And additionally we have a debt maturity coming due next year of $500 million. Moving to our FAS/CAS outlook. We expect our net 2021 FAS/CAS adjustment will be approximately $2.1 billion and that's similar to the adjustment for 2020. This estimate assumes a discount rate at the end of the year of 2.5% or 75 basis points below the 2019 rate. And based on our performance to date, we are assuming a 7% return on our assets for 2020 and we are maintaining that same rate of 7% per year for our long-term asset return assumption. And finally on chart 11, we have our summary. We have seen growth and strong performance from all our business areas this year with increased backlog and sustained cash generation throughout the year. Our updated 2020 financial metrics anticipate strong full year results and we expect to see continued operational performance and increased cash flows in 2021. Based on our portfolio of legacy programs, new wins and strategic investments in key growth areas, we have continued to grow our backlog, deliver value to our customers and return cash to our stockholders. And with that, we're ready for your questions. John? Good morning. Thanks Sheila. I'll tell you what, I'll kick it off and then I'll ask Jim if he's got some color at the end. So, it's probably best we start with how we got to this trend data. So, if you think of our planning process over the last couple of months, we've been going through our long-range plan, working with our business areas, and then working with the corporation on assumptions regarding tax or pension assumptions et cetera. We then review that with our Board, and it's primarily a reaffirmation of our 2020 numbers and then the long-range plan for 2021 through 2023. Do that in the late September time period. The quarter closes, we then do an assessment to come up with what we think our trend data will be. And I'll just remind everybody and we've said it in our prepared comments, Jim and I we did take our guidance up $1 billion for 2020. So if I could go around the horn. I'll do sales go around the horn, and then I'll give you some -- my perspective on some opportunities out there and then hand it over to Jim. So we start with Aero, and we look at 2021. Right now, we're seeing low-single-digit growth year-over-year for the portfolio. And specifically, if you talk about F-35, we're seeing growth similar to the overall Aero growth of low-single digits. Right now, we see production and development flat and we see primarily the growth coming from sustainment as our fleet expands. On F-16, we see solid growth as the program continues to ramp up production activities and also the modernization programs that we have going on at -- for F-16. Air mobility sales surprisingly are flattish. We've been talking about a slight decline, but they are stable going into 2021. And finally for Aeronautics, we do anticipate seeing strong double-digit growth at our Skunk Works, our classified Advanced Development Programs. We continue to execute on those recent awards. If I move on to Missiles and Fire Control, we're seeing low-single-digit growth there as well, and that's after several years of very strong growth as we approach production capacity on some major missile programs. Think of Hellfire and GMLRS. We're still seeing very strong demand there, but just year-over-year we see it being more flattish than not. Our growth is being led by our production programs, think PAC-3, which will be up double-digits. Precision fires will be up mid-single digits and JASSM-LRASM will be up double digits. That's partially offsetting some of the growth in our THAAD programs and that's just due to some procurement cost timing on a multi-year award. If I could move to RMS, we also anticipate low-single-digit growth there as well at least for now. At Sikorsky, we're seeing low-single-digit growth, and that's a reflection of the mix across our production programs as life cycles change. So think of the Combat Rescue Helicopter program and CH-53K, we'll see double-digit growth there as these programs ramp up into production, that's partially offset the growth at VH-92 as it ramps down and lower volumes on our Canadian military helicopter program, and the same with Black Hawk even though it's a strong contributor, and the top line year-over-year we'll see a modest decline. Within IWSS, we'll see a slight decline from 2021. Our Aegis franchise, however, will see high-single-digit growth and that's driven by international opportunities, so we're still seeing international opportunities there. Offsetting that growth, we're seeing reductions within our Radar business as the TPQ declines, while we await the next-gen programs. Think of Sentinel and TPY-X beyond 2021, and we're also seeing lower volume on our Littoral Combat Ship program in 2021. Nice surprise in RMS is our training solutions. We're going to see solid double-digit growth there driven by digital percentage of POT events in 2021 on an international pilot training program. And then finally Space, it will be -- right now we see it as our highest growth business area, mid single-digit range. Think of that as the strategic missile defense portfolio is expected to be up double digits. That's mainly driven by hypersonics programs and then also the anticipated next-generation interceptor award, and that's partially offset by the growth and reductions on our legacy MIL space programs, and predominantly think SBIRS, Advanced EHF, and GPS, they're all down mid-single digits due to program life cycle. So we'll go into January, we'll spend the next three months going through the second phase of our plan, and a couple of things before we give guidance, we'll see how we ended 2020, how we finish the year. We'll then reassess our orders plan for 2021 and adjust that accordingly and its impact that it has on our 2021 top line growth for sales. And then, we'll look at our backlog and look at the assumptions that our business areas are making of conversions to sales in 2021. And before I turn the call over to Jim, just some orders opportunities that are out there. We still see continued need and demand for additional capabilities on F-35 that ultimately down the road maybe not in 2021, but we'll see some growth there in the future. There are certainly other countries that have a keen interest in the F-35 from a product standpoint. So we'll see demand there. F-16, Jim mentioned the IDIQ contract, we received the first two countries that are part of that IDIQ. We see many opportunities out there for F-16, and the same with C-130. And then in the classified area of Aeronautics, there are a multitude of opportunities out there. In Missiles and Fire Control, we have TLVS. That's a future air and missile defense program for Germany. There's upside there for us. CH-53K in RMS for international. Of course, we've always talked about the Future Vertical Lift. And then in space, there's classified space. And then most of these are platform programs Sheila. There are others. We're looking to focus on our mission systems. Jim talked about the 5G work and the interconnectivity of our products solution for our customer, and I'll let him give some more color on that if he has it. So \u2013 hey, Myles. Good morning. So first question on the backlog. We are right now planning on growing our backlog in the fourth quarter. There is one binary event that has to happen and that is the closure on Lot 15 production. We're in the midst of negotiations with the customer right now. I think there's agreement on both sides to try to get this done by year-end. But if it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen and it rolls into next year. But if it does happen, we will continue the growth in the fourth quarter of backlog increase. Okay. Hey, Rich, that sounded like a four part question. I'm not good at math. So, yeah regarding the margin reduction on Space. It's based on a couple of things. One, we had one less event on ULA. There was a slip in one of the launches. So that was the main driver. But you also had lower risk retirements on advanced EHF and fleet ballistic missile in 2020 compared to 2019. Regarding SpaceX and then I'll let Jim chime in. We at ULA \u2013 we Boeing and the United Launch Alliance leadership team we have seen SpaceX as an emerging threat. I mean, they are more than an emerging threat right now. But what I would say is of the recent competitions we've had with them, we've actually been pleased with the outcome of where ULA landed relative to SpaceX. So I think going forward, we're confident that we certainly have the mission capable abilities, but we also think we now have a price point that is compelling to customers that will allow ULA to get its fair share of awards over SpaceX. I don't know, Jim, if you want to talk about the next two. Yes. Hi, Noah. You bet. Thanks Noah for the question. Yeah there's a couple of things. Let's talk top line, there's a couple of things going on. So as I mentioned, when Sheila opened up the call with the question on where we saw slowness of growth some of it is just \u2013 some of our tactical strike missile programs are at capacity right now. So think of Hellfire and GMLRS. You have a little bit of a timing issue with THAAD. But going forward, we see growth with THAAD. The growth opportunities for Missiles and Fire Control down the road will be PAC-3, and precision fires for the most part, because of the \u2013 they are not at capacity and we are seeing extremely strong demand internationally and domestically for that product. And what we didn't talk about in the development phase still is the large classified program that we have. We will start to see in the next four to five years that go into a limited rate production and then ultimately into production and you will see a large increase there as well. So I think \u2013 I think you see \u2013 I think you see at least in the short term some of the areas are going to be capped by capacity, but we'll work with our customer based on the strong demand that we see does it make sense for \u2013 to us to increase our capacity for say Hellfire's for example. Regarding margins, for 2021, we actually do see it's a slight decline to margins in 2021 and I do mean slight. And as we've talked about it before and I just mentioned it with that development program as it continues to grow at the topline, we'll see dilution there. That's the main reason. But -- so think of margins as a slight dilution in 2021. You bet Cai. Good morning. Yes, so we've been embarking on what I'll call a culture of cash for quite some time now and we are actually starting to see the fruits of that effort Cai. And to your point what we're seeing in 2021 as I stated in my prepared comments I gave you all some color on 2021, 2022 on our last call. So, here's what we're seeing now. It's -- obviously the farther out we go the little less granular it is. But to the best of our abilities by doing long-range plan, balance sheets, and cash flow statements what we're seeing right now is as you stated $8.1 billion of cash from operations in 2021 which as we stated is $300 million above the outlook we talked about earlier. Right now we're seeing CapEx in 2021 at about $1.7 billion. That's fairly consistent with what we're seeing this year. And as you mentioned we've got the payroll tax holiday this year. It's a tailwind of $460 million. And we're also getting the benefit of about $750 million $800 million by the end of the year of the acceleration of the progress payment rate from 90% -- excuse me 80% to 90%. We are going to accelerate all of those benefits that we got from the government to our supply chain. So, we will be whole -- we'll have the government whole in 2020 with those benefits we received. So, we do have -- with that payroll tax we do have a headwind. 50% of that $460 million gets paid next year. So, that is a headwind. And then the other half gets paid out in 2022. As you state, we do have $1 billion pension contribution next year. In the following year, what we're seeing in 2022 is we now see a number closer to $8.2 billion. We gave you a little color in the last call. We were at $7.9 billion, so another $300 million improvement on cash from operations. We see CapEx today based on what we know today in terms of our capacity requirements and infrastructure builds and whatnot $1.7 billion in 2022. So CapEx will be roughly $1.7 billion from 2020 to 2022. And actually, I'll go out to 2023 we think CapEx right now is about $1.7 billion. So we have that other headwind as we mentioned on payroll tax in 2022, and we have the pension payment of about \u2013 it's about $1.7 billion out in 2022. So I think pre-pension payment our cash from operations right now in 2022 is about $10 billion. Now the only other wildcard in all this is we've talked about the change in the R&D tax assumptions where we're no longer expensing R&D out in 2022 and beyond. We're amortizing it. So that assumption would reduce our cash from operations out in 2022 by $2.1 billion. Out in 2023 we see cash from operations of greater than or equal to $8.3 billion so another $100 million increase from where we see 2022. I mentioned, our CapEx at about $1.7 billion. Right now, we're forecasting a pension contribution of roughly $1.7 billion. And the R&D impact goes down from $2.1 billion it will be about $1.8 billion out in that time period. So we have spent a lot of effort on our working capital improvements. And to be frank Cai, we think certainly in contract assets we have some opportunities still to hopefully improve these numbers. Good morning. Thanks. Hi, Jon. Almost good afternoon. So I'll -- it's Ken, I'll take that. So if you go around the portfolio, we are still seeing demand for CapEx. And then there's one point I'll make and I'll hand it to Jim because he may have a comment on this as well. But if you think Aeronautics, we have slowed down our capitalization spend on F-35 because of COVID. But if we're still going to ramp up to those higher quantities that I described when Doug asked me the question on F-35, we are going to have to still build out our capacity on F-35.  The same with F-16. Jim mentioned our backlog right now is 130 aircraft. We're going to deliver our first airplane roughly beginning of 2022. Rough numbers we'll do about eight a year. And then ultimately by the time we get out to the middle of this decade, we'll be delivering three to four F-16s a month. So we will have to build out that capacity.  And then we've talked about the classified win in Palmdale, we still need to build the building out there. And we are hopeful that performing on that program, there are other customers that have a keen interest in that program and that's one of the opportunities I talked about when Sheila asked the question. There are opportunities out there for us that just frankly aren't planned right now.  If you look at Missiles and Fire Control, we are still building out capacity for PAC-3 though we're not building it out for say Hellfire or GMLRS. We'll talk to the customer. We feel very good about the PAC-3 build-out for example. We do see opportunities for 500-plus PAC-3s per year and potentially significantly more than that. The question then is does -- is it the right time for us to continue building out in excess of the 500 per year that we are going to build out.  Space, we have the state-of-the-art Gateway Center. And there are some other opportunities out there where we have to spend capital. And then RMS, they've done a very nice job of portfolio-shaping. That is the place we really don't see a lot of facilitization or increased capital.  One thing Jim has tasked us on and we're in the middle of doing this not just for capital, but IRAD and then other investments are there low-hanging fruit if you will where it does it make sense for us to spend that capital or our IRAD. And then are there places where we should be investing regarding 21st century warfighter, the digitalization effort that we're trying to take on. So though we may stay at the same level, the balance or the mix of our spend may change over time. You bet. Thanks, Seth. I think, we're at the afternoon now. Yes so, at Aeronautics, we're actually -- we expect a slight improvement in margins from 2020, which we're very pleased with. F-35 margins and the balance of our compact -- combat air margins are expected to increase and that's consistent with our overall margins. And we expect fairly consistent margins in 2021 on air mobility. The combat air and air mobility margin improvements more than offset the dilution because you would expect just where the Skunk Works is that they would be dilutive. And I mentioned Missiles and Fire Control, so I'll move on to RMS. We're happy to see returns to double-digit margins this year and we expect a slight improvement in 2021 which we're very pleased with, so all that integration work that we've talked about. We talked about the portfolio shaping that we're doing at RMS. We're starting to see the results there. Sikorsky is the primary driver. They'll have year-over-year improvements on production programs. Think of those set as Blackhawk VH-92 and CRH. And then lastly at Space, we'll see a little bit of an erosion in margins in 2021. And that's very similar to Missiles and Fire Control. You're seeing dilution due to the OPIR development program and also increased development content at strategic missiles and missile defense portfolio. Think of that as hypersonics and then the next-generation interceptor. So, thanks for the question."

It's a pleasure to be here on my first Lockheed Martin\u2019s earnings call, and I look forward to working with all of you. I hope this call finds you and your families safe and healthy. The world continues to combat the coronavirus outbreak while it is striving to recover and sustain economic activity. Our primary objective at Lockheed Martin is to ensure the health and welfare of our employees and their families, our teammates, customers, and communities. We remain vigilant taking the necessary steps to help protect our workforce while producing the products and solutions our customers need to achieve their important readiness objectives. Our business areas have taken actions including implementing alternative work schedules, health and safety checks at our facilities, and telework wherever possible. Most recently, our Aeronautics team established a rotational facility plan for our F-35 production line, allowing us to continue to manufacture the aircraft while practicing social distancing and completing regular deep cleanings. The corporation also continues to support our critical industrial base suppliers, frontline medical workers, and our local communities with COVID-19 relief and response. In March, the Department of Defense announced it would increase progress payment rates to large businesses from 80% to 90% accelerating payments for the completion of work in recognition of the challenges posed by COVID-19. The DoD\u2019s expectation was that prime contractors would flow these accelerated payments to the supply chain. Through the second quarter Lockheed Martin has flowed all of the accelerated payments the corporation has received from the Department of Defense, $1.3 billion in total to our supply chain. In this process, we've given priority to small and vulnerable suppliers as we continue our efforts to promote a healthy and sustainable defense industrial base. We've also continued to support our local communities and to date have made substantial donations to non-profit organizations involved in COVID-19 related relief and assistance with emphasis on veterans and military families. And as a global organization employing thousands across the world, we are supporting related initiatives in 15 different countries, including donations to food banks, healthcare facilities, distance learning, and research efforts to help combat this disease. This corporation has hired more than 9,000 new employees across United States since the crisis began and is advertising for another 3,000 positions. We remain on track with plans to hire approximately 12,000 employees during 2020. And across the country, we produced more than 65,000 protective gowns and 30,000 face shields, and we've donated PPE at 174 locations where frontline medical workers are caring for COVID-19 patients and others of risk. Through all these initiatives, Lockheed Martin remains committed to supporting our employees, our suppliers, and communities in which our company operates through the course of this ongoing pandemic. Ken will review our first quarter financials and updated full-year outlook in more detail in a few minutes. As you've seen from our press release, we had a very strong quarter financially despite the effects of the coronavirus. Mitigation plans put in place by each of our business areas, their teammates and supply chain, the international community, as well as strong support from the Department of Defense and broad U.S. government actions have allowed us to minimize the financial impacts on our company. This coupled with outstanding operational performance have enabled us to increase our full year outlook for sales, earnings, EPS, and cash from operations. Sales in the quarter were 12% greater than last year, as all the four business areas increased from 2019. Our segment operating profit results were also strong, growing 15% year-over-year, driven by both higher sales growth and an increase in segment profit margin to 11%. We had a strong quarter of cash generation, bringing in over $2.2 billion of cash from operations and executed our balanced cash deployment strategy. Moving to new business activities, we received nearly $22 billion in orders this quarter, raising our backlog to over $150 billion, a new high watermark. Our Aeronautics business area led the company with over $9 billion of orders, including $7 billion of total orders booked for the F-35. We were able to add 84 jets to the program with the finalization of two Lot 14 production contracts, bringing the current number of planes in our backlog to 411 aircraft. Our F-35 team also added approximately $1 billion in combined sustainment and development awards this quarter as well. Missiles and Fire Control also had a strong quarter, with the Defense Department announcing several PAC-3 awards, including one for over $6 billion to supply PAC-3 MSE interceptors, launcher modification kits, and associated equipment to support the United States and foreign military sales customers across multiple contract years. These awards demonstrate the global demand for PAC-3 MSE interceptors and to meet that demand this year, we began work on an 85,000 square foot building expansion at our Camden, Arkansas facility. The building is expected to be completed by fourth quarter 2021 with operations they're beginning in the first quarter of 2022.  Our Rotary and Mission Systems secured orders of over $1 billion to support and supply 24 MH-60 Romeo helicopters to the Government of India. These Sikorsky SEAHAWK aircraft will provide Maritime Anti-Surface and Anti-Submarine Warfare capabilities to India, as well as cargo, utility, and search and rescue missions. And our Space business area added multiple orders including a classified award for over $1 billion. In total, the corporation grew orders 23% above second quarter 2019 and achieved a companywide book-to-bill ratio of nearly 1.4 for the quarter. I'll touch briefly now on the Department of Defense budgets as both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have completed the respective markups of the fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act. Each version adheres to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 spending targets and equal approximately $740 billion for national defense. Appropriation committees from each chamber are in the process of drafting the funding legislation to accompany the authorization. There are encouraging elements for our portfolio as the Senate version confirmed that the national defense strategy remains the roadmap for the armed services, and the bill was passed with strong bipartisan support. Our portfolio was well supported in the Senate version for the recommended increase of 16 F-35 aircraft above the President's request, additional funding for Missile Defense priorities including an 8 THAAD battery, and increased funding for the Homeland Defense Radar-Hawaii program. Congress will continue with the authorization and appropriation phases. We look forward to the finalization of the process and supporting our warfighters needs. Moving on, I\u2019d like to highlight several significant events that occurred across the corporation during the past quarter. Beginning with Aeronautics, the F-35 team achieved another operational milestone, as our United Kingdom partner celebrated the initial carrier deployment of its 617 Squadron. This legendary unit, known as the Dambusters from their exploits in World War II is now aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier. The Squadron will now begin a series of flight trials demonstrating the jets ability to defend the carrier who Combat Air Patrols, rapid deployment and interoperability with other U.K. Naval assets. This is all in preparation for their second embarkation later in the year, when the Squadron will join the carrier and her task group for a large multinational training exercise with U.S., European and NATO partners. The ship will then set sail again next year for her maiden Global Carrier Strike Group 21 deployment. We're proud to provide this unrivaled fifth generation aircraft to help support our U.K. partner in the security of their nation. Moving to RMS, our radar surveillance systems team achieved two notable milestones this quarter. In April, they successfully completed the Sentinel A4 Radar Program preliminary design review, following successful system requirement and system functional reviews, which took place earlier this year. So just four months after the initial contract award, the Sentinel team has already achieved several key milestones as it progresses the critical design review phase later this year, and then in a fabrication, demonstration and test. The Sentinel A4 Radar replaces the current A3 variant and will provide improved Air and Missile Defense against low flying unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles, drones and other threats. For the program of record of approximately 200 systems plus international partnerships the Sentinel Program alone has a total potential contract value of over $3 billion. RMS also delivered to the U.S. Army, the first AN/TPQ-53 radar system, which is equipped with Gallium Nitride to provide additional power and enhanced counter fire target acquisition capabilities. The TPQ-53 radar locates and tracks enemy indirect fire, neither a 360 degree or a 90 degree mode and it was first deployed in 2010 to Iraq and Afghanistan, where it delivered outstanding performance and reliability to defend our troops. We are currently in [4A] production to provide approximately 190 units with a contract value at $1.6 billion. The both the Sentinel A4 and the TPQ-53 are part of Lockheed Martin's open scalable radar architecture, the cornerstone of each of these systems design, which allows for upgrades that will not only extend the lives of the radars but evolve their capabilities over the next 40 or so years. In Missiles and Fire Control, our Air and Missile Defense line of business mark the delivery of the 500 FAD interceptor to the U.S. Army. The FADprogram is a key part of the U.S. Missile Defense System has been selected by multiple international partners to support their national security. MFC continues to expand our production facilities to accommodate that demand. This quarter our space business area, as part of the Blue Origin National Team in this really is exciting and was down selected for the next phase of the human landing system for NASA's Artemis program. The Artemis program is the country's ambitious endeavor to land humans on the moon in 2024 and return them safely to Earth. Leveraging designs and technologies used on our Orion program, Lockheed Martin will produce the crew ascent element, the vehicle which will transport astronauts from the lunar surface to begin their journey back to earth. We look forward to supporting this remarkable mission and continue long running out of legacy of supporting NASA mission. Before I turn over the call to Ken, I'd like to take a moment to thank Marillyn Hewson for her years of leadership and express how honored I am to have the opportunity to lead Lockheed Martin, a company that I consider a national asset. My experiences as an Air Force pilot, flying Lockheed Martin Aircraft and Operation Desert Shield helped shape my belief that helping to provide for the defense of our nation and its allies, is one of the most important endeavors that one can undertake. When presented with the opportunity to become President and Chief Executive Officer here, I viewed it not as a job offer but as a call to service. Moreover, Marillyn and her Executive Team has positioned the company for even greater success for the future, and I'm eager to deliver on that prospect. Since becoming CEO about a month ago, I've met Hewson virtually with a significant number of our key government customers to introduce myself, reaffirm our commitment to performance and affordability and get their feedback. I've been pleased with the broad response of confidence and Lockheed Martin is a key partner, but also the candid discussions on the challenges we jointly face in the National Security Space. There's great appreciation for the technologies and solutions we provide. And we have a long heritage of innovation for our customers. I plan to continue this legacy as well as pursue a long-term strategy to deliver enhanced capabilities to support what I call the 21st century war-fighter concept. That concept endeavors to bring relevant lessons in the latest technologies from the broader tech sector to the defense industrial base. I believe Lockheed Martin is uniquely positioned to address this and other evolving security needs of our nation and its allies. And I'm excited to have this opportunity. I've also had the chance to meet with many of you in our Investor Community in recent weeks that engage in conversations and I look to continuing that dialogue. As you can tell, I'm quite convinced that we can further leverage our key platform positions and broad portfolio to drive a long-term value to our shareholders while furthering both National Defense and Scientific Discovery. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.\nKenneth Possenriede: Well, thank you, Jim, and welcome aboard, and good morning to everyone. As Jim noted, I also hope that each of you are doing well and staying safe. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results and year-over-year growth in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter. We delivered $16.2 billion in sales, $1.8 billion in segment operating profit and $5.79 in earnings per share, which included a non-cash charge related to an international joint venture that we are now exiting. We generated $2.2 billion of cash from operations and we continue to execute our balance cash deployment plan for 2020 returning almost $1 billion to our shareholders. We achieved a new record backlog of greater than $150 billion exceeding our all time high for the corporation for the eighth consecutive quarter. We have updated our full year guidance increasing our estimates for sales, earnings and operating cash flow as COVID-19 mitigation plans and our outstanding performance and minimize our year-to-date impacts. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the business in challenging times. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 12% to $16.2 billion led by volume in Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control, while segment operating profit increased 15% led by earnings growth and Aero and RMS. The resulting segment operating margin was a strong 11% for the second quarter. These results include the impacts caused by COVID-19 and reflect the proactive efforts of Lockheed Martin in our customers to mitigate these disruptions, particularly as they apply to our supply chain. And as we have closely monitored this evolving situation, it has become apparent that some of the impact we anticipated will be realized in the second half of 2020 versus being contained primarily in 2Q. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for 2Q, 2020. Our EPS of $5.79 was up $0.79 over results of last year, driven by our sales volume increase favorable performance and additional FAS/CAS income and excluding the $0.34 for the impairment of the international joint venture we are exiting, the second quarter earnings per share would have been $6.13. On Chart 6, we will discuss in more detail the cash returned to our shareholders this quarter. We also had a strong quarter of cash flow generating $2.2 billion in cash from operations. We continue to invest in capital projects to support long-term growth, which resulted in over $1.8 billion of free cash flow. We paid out dividends of $2.40 per share and repurchased $259 million worth of shares. And year-to-date, we have now repurchased over $1 billion in shares fulfilling our 2020 outlook. Our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow allows us to continue with our long standing balanced cash deployment strategy. Let's move on to Chart 7, strong operational performance in all business areas have allowed us to increase our outlook for all financial metrics, as we continue to implement mitigation actions to combat the coronavirus. We are now projecting full year sales growth of 7% over 2019 with consistent segment profit margins, and we've increased our cash flow by $400 million to greater than or equal to $8 billion. On Chart 8, we will break out the increased sales guidance by business area. We have adjusted our estimates for Aeronautics, Space and RMS, increasing the midpoint of our sales range by $1.125 billion. And based on our current assessment of the full year, while COVID-19 has caused disruption in our supply chain and as some of our key locations, we have had non-COVID performance that has offset the impacts and gives us confidence to increase our 2020 outlook. On Chart 9, we show the corresponding increases to segment operating profit by business area, again led by Aeronautics, Space and RMS. And in total, we have raised the midpoint of our segment operating profit guidance by $100 million. And to conclude, on Chart 10, we have our summary. We had a strong quarter, both operationally and financially and we have increased our full year outlook for all metrics. We had another quarter of backlog growth, our eighth in a row, a reflection of the strength provided by our broad portfolio. We continue to closely monitor the environment and evolving conditions in our business related to COVID-19. And we remain committed to providing long-term value to our customers and our shareholders. And with that, John, we are ready to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. We ask you, please limit yourself to one question, if you have any follow-up questions, you can place yourself back into the queue. And first, with the line of David Strauss with Barclays Bank. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning.\nDavid Strauss: Hey, Jim, to follow up on some of your comments, I wanted to ask you how do you see Lockheed portfolio positioned to perform relative to peers, if you look out at potentially a tougher budget environment over the near term, and how you're thinking about sustaining the Company's peer leading growth into the longer term, if you could take this both from an R&D perspective as well as how you will evaluate investment decisions from a return perspective? Thanks.\nJames Taiclet: Sure, David, good morning. This company to me is incredibly well positioned for any reasonable range of outcomes in defense spending in the economy over the next few years as well as -- as breadth of product and service that is really essential to the National Defense strategy. So when you put the two things together, I think the company, vis-\u00e0-vis peers is incredibly well positioned relative to others. The backlog of $150 billion is equipment and services that the customer needs, they've already signed up and budgeted for. And again, there are ways to solve both opportunity sets. One is if there's a rising defense budget or stable one, we can continue to deliver on that backlog just as it\u2019s contracted, but if it changes, those requirements are still going to need to be met. And because of our platform position, David, we can extend and broaden the capabilities of existing platforms, make sure that their life can be extended while at the same time of being upgraded to whatever standard is required at that point in time. So, I think the breadth of the Company's portfolio of products, services, and domains that we operate in is going to position us well even at a downturn, frankly. Secondly, on long-term growth, that's -- the threats aren't going away. Defense is going to have to be supported, I think in any reasonable person's view going forward, especially if those people are in positions of responsibility no matter what party they may come from. So I view that defense has got to be an important priority for the country. Going forward, there may be a mix change, if you will, but it's still going to be an important priority. Again, the benefit of coming in the door here is the existing portfolio position of the company across the services, domains, international space, et cetera. That broad platform is a risk mitigator in my opinion, to a downturn and say the defense spending trajectory. So on the upside, the innovation gene at this company is fantastic. So when you can apply that innovation genetic framework to the broad portfolio that we have and I hope bring in some tech industry practices and maybe some new partnerships and technologies to augment that I think the upside for long-term growth is really tremendous. And on the R&D front, if we can get our customers convinced that certain types of independent research and development needs to be compensated for perhaps new ways by the government, so the companies like ours and others can take risks, so we can bring in partners that are willing to take risk, at least knowing they may have a path to compensation at the end of the day, and then we're going to be able to accelerate our growth. So we're in a great position to try to work in any environment I think, whether it's defense spending, technology deployment, I've got an idea called 5G.mil that we're going to try to figure out how to create and really bring that technology as just one example, entire [ph]space and drive performance at this company as a result of that.\nDavid Strauss: And Jim, just quick follow up there. How do you -- based on your time at American Tower, how do you measure success from a financial perspective? I think there you really emphasized free cash flow and free cash flow per share and return on invested capital, are you going to apply the same kind of framework at Lockheed?\nJames Taiclet: Yes, I'm pleased to say that Ken's already applying it as we speak and before I got here, so I was really glad to see that that's a capital allocation decisions have historically been made here. I think that my experience at American Tower, we used a wide variety of vehicles to deploy capital, get others to do it on our behalf and in partnership with us. And maybe we can add some of those elements here, and some might be pre-existing relationships in the tech sector and telecom to join us in some of this investment profile. But, I do think that that we can continue to drive cash flow per share growth here and ROIC stability or expansion at the same time we did at American Tower over a 20-year period. And I think we can do it here too.\nOperator: Our next question from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRobert Spingarn: Well, good morning.\nJames Taiclet: Hi.\nRobert Spingarn: Welcome, Jim. Very nice first quarter out of the gate. I have a couple of quick things for Ken on the guide. So Ken, MFC was the one segment where you didn't change the guidance, you had this good bookings quarter, and I guess growth declines a little bit in the second half. Is this a result of COVID? Is it just where the business is? When would -- might it re-accelerate to double-digits? And then just separately, I wanted to ask you what you've got embedded in the guide for F-35 production sustainment and development?\nJames Taiclet: You bet.\nKenneth Possenriede: Good morning, Rob. So yes, Missiles and Fire Control is the one that we did not adjust guidance. So, you're exactly right. Just to remind everybody, it is still our fastest growing business area, still most profitable business area. But going around the horn, and it's a little bit of what I talked about in the first quarter, our biggest concern from a COVID impact standpoint was clearly at Aeronautics and clearly the main driver -- main concern at Aeronautics is F-35, and we've done a good job of anticipating that in the quarter and hence the results you saw in the quarter. We had really strong results at Missiles and Fire Control in the second quarter frankly and in the first half. You're right, if you look at where we're going, we\u2019re holding guidance. We do see COVID impacts. This is a very high-volume business, so we are starting to see some pressure on Hellfire deliveries and ATACM deliveries regarding -- and mainly driven by COVID. But, we're going to be up year-over-year mid-single digit from a growth standpoint in the second half, so still pleased with the trajectory of where the business is going. Let's see your second question on guidance for F-35. Yes, second quarter, we saw strong growth across F-35. Follow on modernization we\u2019ve received some awards in the quarter that resulted in strong sales growth year-over-year. In fact, we'll see that into the second half of the year. Production, if you recall, we had a little bit of a slow start in the first quarter and that was basically timing of supplier payments to us that picked up in the second quarter, but really strong production growth in the second quarter and sustainment is up as well. And so for the year, we're looking at double-digit growth for F-35. Overall, we're seeing development up really strong, sustainment really strong and production mid single-digits, which is higher than what we thought.\nOperator: Our next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes, good morning.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning.\nGeorge Shapiro: Ken, I wanted to pursue a little bit more Aeronautics, F-35 you had an incremental margin of like 18.5% in the quarter. So obviously, it must have raised the margin if you can share how much the margin went up. And then my second question, if you look at your implied guidance at the high end, the second half of the year has only 3% growth in aero, way down from 15.5% in the first half. And the margin is implied at about 10.6%. So is that just being conservative or are we starting to really see some slow down there? Thanks.\nKenneth Possenriede: Thank you, George. So yes, in the quarter, F-35 was up very, very strong on the top line growth, there production was up strong sustainment of strong as I mentioned on the previous question. If you look at margins, from a production standpoint, they were strong double-digit. We had some risk retirements on a few of our production lots. So it wasn't just [blocked by] but it was a few of our previous lots that actually are still open. So we had some retirements, their development so FCD, the FCD has wound down. That was a low margin business for us. And now, we're embarking on follow on modernization with our customer. And we're seeing strong -- though its cost plus we are seeing stronger margins that we did on FCD think of those as high single-digit margins. And then on sustainment, we had a variety of risk retirement, not one single sustainment program that I could spike out, but there's a variety of sustainment programs that had some risk retirements in the quarter so, so you're right on that a strong quarter from a margin standpoint. Second half, we're not anticipating the risk retirements that we had in the -- in this quarter George and your other question was looking at the high end of the guidance. So though we think we have done a very good job with our customer mitigating a lot of the risks due to COVID in the second quarter, where we are starting to see risks specifically in Texas and specifically in our supply chain due to COVID. And we do anticipate seeing a couple of hundred million dollar impacts specifically on F-35 production, top line due to COVID risks. And so to your question is that being conservative, it's only conservative if COVID does not happen, but if it happens, we feel comfortable with our midpoint of guidance and our high end of guidance.\nOperator: And next we go to the line of Jonathan Raviv with Citi. Please go ahead.\nJonathan Raviv: Thank you and welcome Jim looking forward to working with you hope everyone as well.\nJames Taiclet: Thank you.\nJonathan Raviv: Just thinking about cap allocation, I know you guys have reiterated your balanced capital strategy. When I think back to the last time this industry faced the potential political change, high deficits, potential budget pressure, the capital allocation strategy looked to get a little bit imbalanced. So just any more further perspective on how capital allocation strategy can shift and flex, if the reality on the ground changed and what might be different today versus let's say 10 years ago, 10 years ago, you're having to repo pretty big dividend on a relative basis, CapEx fell a lot, whereas now CapEx is still at a pretty high level. So because we've been your -- very unlevered balance sheet as well, and to think about how capital allocation plays a role in a pressured budget environment? Thank you.\nKenneth Possenriede: Thanks, Jon. Hi, good morning. It's Ken, I hope you're well as well. So I'll take that, Jon, we're committed to providing still significant portion of our cash flow to our shareholders that's regardless of, what happens, what this downturn looks like. But, I'll \u2013 I will start with cash. And we just took our cash up to the greater than or equal to $8 billion this year. We have some tailwinds. And frankly, this year we have some headwinds and with that balance in what we see, with our working capital improvements, we were comfortable doing that. One thing I'll say going out to the future, and it's based on our strong backlog and it\u2019s what I'll call our culture of cash. I've mentioned in the past that we're comfortable right now even with the headwinds that we see out in 2021 of $7.7 billion based on what we see right now, we're comfortable taking that up $100 million to $7.8 billion. And then out to 2022 we talked about the pre-tax change for the amortization of R&D that we saw a path to roughly $7.8 billion in 2022. We're comfortable today taking that up another $100 million. So think of just cash that could be used for internal investments and for cash deployment up $400 million this year up $100 million next year, and up $100 in 2022. We've talked about capital this year and next year are probably the highest capital spends we're going to have think rough numbers, about [$1.07] billion this year, though, there is an appetite to spend more at the business areas, but right now, we're forecasting [$1.07] billion and probably [$1.07] billion next year, which gives us still very strong, free cash flow going forward. We're committed to the dividend, there's absolutely no question. That is our priority. And we don't see that changing in the future. Jim and I will go to the Board to recommend a change to our dividend rate in the September timeframe for the next four quarters. Based on what we see today, it's -- for planning purposes, we should assume high single-digit increases. I think for planning purposes. That's what we'll plan going out into the futures. I still think repos, repos has a place for us. We've talked about the $1 billion this year, we've done about [$1.01ish] billion through July, we're now going to pause at least in the near-term, it makes sense for us to do that based on this COVID environment. And just from a planning standpoint, we should assume $1 billion in 2021 and 2022. And think of that is to prevent dilution in our share count. And as you mentioned, and Jim has talked about this other investments we need to make. We have the balance sheet to do that we have the cash flow to do that. And you saw in the second quarter, we did flow of [$1.150] billion a debt. We did that opportunistically got a great yield on that money. And we're -- we'll continue looking at whether it makes sense for us to go into the debt market, whether it's for organic or inorganic investments.\nJames Taiclet: So Jon, this is Jim. Ken just gave you a great landscape picture of the whole the scenery here, and I can go ahead and pick up on one thing he did say about maybe something you were looking for in your question, too, is, what would we do different potentially in a downturn on capital allocation, and just to recap the dividends there it's going to be a growing dividend in our view at least Ken and mine and the Board I expect would agree with us. But in a downturn in my historical, recent experience, and my philosophy here is that may be also presenting an opportunity for us if there is a downturn, we're going to look at the silver linings that may be there. And whether it's M&A and other investments. So if you add together the scale of Lockheed Martin in the cash flow that comes from that, they can just define the backlog on top of it the extends out into time and the balance sheet strength that we have, there could be opportunities for us to act in a time period where asset prices are depressed for things that we may want to bring into the company or JV with or whatever. And so that's just another way to picture it, is it the strength and the breadth and the foundation this company allow -- could allow us as it did in my prior experience to get assets we really wanted. That might be even more available at attractive prices, which then drive the nice ROI that you want the cash flow growth to come with it?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And then next we\u2019ll go with the line of Richard Safran with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nRichard Safran: Thanks. Jim, Ken, Greg, good morning. How are you?\nJames Taiclet: Good, Rich. Good morning.\nRichard Safran: So if you mentioned this in your opening remarks, I apologize. I missed it. Hopefully we have a fiscal \u201821 budget in place by starting the fiscal year. But, what I wanted to focus on was -- and what I wanted to ask you was about the global settlement you've talked about, and I'm sure you're aware that there's also been chatter about additional stimulus funding. So what I was looking for, is if there's any risk to your cash flows, and sales guide if there actually isn't a global settlement endorsed and or stimulus funding, I'm just curious about what assumptions are embedded in the new guide and what you're expecting from the settlement?\nJames Taiclet: Yes, good morning, Rich, I'll take that. So you're right. We have provided [OSD] the Department of Defense [indiscernible] based on what we see as impacts to Lockheed Martin and its supply chain that go out to September. We just had a few internal conversations and we're starting to have conversations with the customer probably make sense since that is already stale, this is a fluid situation probably makes sense for us to update that rough order of magnitude and it may make sense for it to -- for us to extend it beyond September. We'll go through that with them. Regarding what, what we're assuming from a sales and margin standpoint, what we're generally seeing Rich, is these impacts are out farther than we thought the three months ago, and probably more in the \u201821 time period. And maybe a little bit in the fourth quarter of this time period. So if there is not a deal, the grand deal, I think, the next course of action would be for us to go work individually with our respective customers to negotiate on a case-by-case basis, what the impacts are to us. And what are not, the issue is going to be, the available funding for that. If there's not funding, these are all allowable costs. And, then the question becomes -- we put that into our forward pricing rates, and there might be some modest impacts to a couple of our programs but that would be probably more at the profit level, not at the top line. And right now we don't see that playing out as advertised. So it's fluid and we're working through this with our customers.\nKenneth Possenriede: Seems like the summary is that the 2020 guidance is not greatly affected in either direction, whether the stimulus goes through or not.\nOperator: Our next question from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes, thank you very much. Jim you come from a tech background. You talked about, seeing opportunity to adopt some practices from commercial technology at Lockheed Martin, potential for partnerships A program you mentioned 5G.mil, could you expand a little bit in terms of how would you bring commercial technology into the company, and what would you expect to gain from it?\nJames Taiclet: Sure, Cai. There's a number of approaches to this. Again, in my previous experience, we were embarking on this for commercial 5G applications, which is Internet-of-Things at scale including autonomous land and air vehicles. So that's happening in the tech sector now. So there's a 5G standards of that there's computing, which is storage and processing of data that's moving to the edge of the network and intermediate places from data centers to the edge. And there's the autonomous vehicle infrastructure and devices, we call them edge devices over in the tech side, that are being built, you think of them as the driverless car, et cetera, et cetera. So all of those elements are being processed a page, it's going to take time, by the way to do any of this in the commercial space. And those practices can be brought over, I think, to the defense industrial base. But only quickly if our customer comes along with us and changes some of the procurement practices, how we can get paid for things, there's a licensing regime that you may be aware of in the telecom space, particularly that enables global standards to be built. And then each participant or competitor designed to that global standard. That's how you can get 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G done in a space of 20 years when it takes that long to get one defense program done. So those are the kind of practices I think we can migrate over with some of those partners that are working on these things on the commercial side. Now, again, this is a long cycle initiative. Is it is on the commercial industry to it's going to require cooperation with our customer, and they're authorizing us to try some of these things. Because no one's going to take any risk on the defense industrial base by implementing these technologies in a different way. If they're not sure they're going to get paid for it. So we've got a lot to do. But frankly, it -- in American Tower we endeavor to change the industry to go from where transmission sites for telecom networks were non-performing cost centers inside the telephone companies and we converted them through commercial practices and basically, sale leaseback type of approach. We turn those assets into performing assets for commercial companies like ours that were able to create value for shareholders over a long arc of time. So this can be done. But it's going to take time, it's going to require just like it required American Tower, the cooperation of our customers, who were then the telephone companies to work with us and engage in this. And the only reason they did was because they could deploy their networks faster, get capital from us to do it and also to have a lower total cost of ownership for the site over time. And when you multiply that by, we have 180,000 sites back in my prior company, we basically help change the industry, not just us, but around the world. That's the kind of aspiration we have here at Lockheed Martin, and we are in a position to do it, and I would argue a way better position than we ever were back in the in the tower and digital infrastructure industry 15, 20 years ago. So that's the aspiration, Cai how to do it we know, we've got a great example on commercial telephony and technology and how they collaborate through standards bodies and other mechanisms in JVs and alliances to get this done. And so those are the kinds of practices we can bring over. It's not easy. It's not going to happen in a hurry. But the benefit again, Lockheed Martin has is the backlog is so strong on what I call the product centric way of doing defense industrial based business, that we've got time. And we can perform as we try to also move the industry towards a network centric way of doing business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much, and good morning.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning.\nSeth Seifman: Ken, I wanted to just follow up quick, maybe on Rich's question about a settlement and the industry has been fairly vocal about this being important. You guys have mentioned that there's not very much impact one way or the other on the guidance for 2020. So should we think about it, then as you know, if it is important, and it's not important for 2022, so we think about it as being something that's important for 2021. And maybe if you could explain to us a little bit about the mechanics of, then there is a settlement sort of what happens is that, is that cash that the company has been missing out on this year, that will come at some point, perhaps next year, how should we think about the mechanics of how that all runs through the P&L?\nKenneth Possenriede: Yes so, whether it hits this year, next year or all years Seth it is important, it's important to the industry. And it's not just Lockheed Martin it would be across our entire supply base. As I mentioned this is fluid, it's got a lot of moving parts. It probably just for our financials, it will -- it modestly in the second half of the year, but then probably hit more and ripple through the supply chain in the first half of 2021 is our best assessment. Mechanically, the way this could work if it was a big settlement, we still have to go through the details, but I'm guessing that the expectation would be so pick the F-35 a brand settlement, I think the expectation internally just from a program performance standpoint and at the customer level, they would want those costs and those budgets if you will to flow into those respective programs. I'm going to speculate that there probably would be some kind of clip level, from a dollar threshold standpoint that we would utilize with the customer set of what gets flow to the program. So there probably is a point where it's going to be a diminishing return and cost more to implement that across programs and not. Assuming if there's not a grant deal I think what you would see is each program would deal with a case-by-case and then mechanically, that's how that would happen. And it would be a sales impact, a cash impact and an EBIT impact across each respective programs. But, what you're talking about ballpark -- whatever our number is, it's -- we're a $65 billion, round up to $65 billion company. It's not going to be that material to our bottom line specifically if it's over a multitude of years. So we'll see, we'll see where this goes. I think this has got to take some time to play out still.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning.\nNoah Poponak: So you feel that a number of questions here on what your business could look like for your capital deployment could look like in the hypothetical that the defense budget declines. And so I wanted to ask you the question, do you think the defense budget will decline? And we all obviously can -- and have a view on that based on the inputs that are visible to us, but I'm assuming you all have more insight into the geopolitical landscape and then maybe what both sides of the [IO] are thinking right now and in the committee's, but also in the potential presidential platform. So maybe beyond just the standard, world a dangerous place so. What is your view on whether or not defense spending goes down and if it were to actually grow? What specifically could make that happen from here?\nJames Taiclet: Noah, it's Jim. I tried to not speculate on the behavior of people that are going to make independent decisions that we can't predict. So we're just getting the company ready for either scenario frankly, if it's stable, slightly rising or moderately rising defense budget, we know how to handle that. But if it's a declining defense budget, we're planning for that too. So we can't predict one way or the other that the behavior of human beings, whether it's six months from now, or whenever they're going to make these kinds of decisions, but what we can do is prepare for both scenarios. And that's exactly what we're doing. All of our BAs are looking at all their programs and saying if and they're planning this under Ken's guidance, if there's a downturn in defense defending, which I've asked every BA to look at and get back into the integrated plan, if in that scenario, it's a red team kind of an exercise, what would we do? It's a contingency plan that says, okay, we would offer with -- to our customers to say, look if your budget is x minus y. This is what we think you should do with our products and programs for extending lives and other things like that. And with the backlog we have in the orders in track and the production lines that are going into supply chains that operate is going to be two to three years before those defense budget cuts actually flow into the defense industrial base production line. So we've got time to work with a customer to make sure that that they can have their contingency plan and we're behind and we're working with them 100%.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Great, thanks. Good morning.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning.\nMyles Walton: Jim, I'm curious. If you look at from an operating segment level, where do you think your leadership might have the most impact from what you're bringing to the table, which are your technology partnerships, lessons learned that vertical integration from an M&A perspective? And how would that manifest would it be, faster growth, better margins, maybe just, where you think you could have the bigger impact, maybe one level down at the organization?\nJames Taiclet: So by operating segment, each of those businesses with the corporate support they've had, they're great at what they do, I'm probably not going to make a better missile design than people in MFC can make so, what I think my benefit or add value added might be as cross cutting those BAs in a way that hadn't been done before here or anywhere else. And then linking them with a customer to do what the customer is literally asking us for, which is how do we connect equipment, systems, communication networks, across what they call domains. So how can I have satellite, get a signal from an F-35, then goes back to a ground based Missile Defense System to hit incoming threat to, up one of our installations? That's what they really want. Not any single one of our business areas or any other companies, frankly, I think could give them that, that solution. So we're working with, our recently hired CTO who was previously running DARPA to look horizontally across what are the missions that the DoD and our allies need to do? And what BAs and what BAs do we have the assets, resources and time technical capabilities to provide them that horizontal solution. So our typical backlog, we're providing what I call vertical solutions, we're providing products, platform, services, generally to one service, the F-35 and exception of course, but to one service, maybe just the one country, but we're going to need to link across services better we're going to need to link across our allies better. And we're -- and that's what this network solution is really about in my mind. So that's what I think Myles we can bring our tech world partners and, and U.S. and other allied countries, companies into this to make us better horizontally. I'm not sure they can even make us all that better, vertically, all that often, but horizontally, I think we can. And that's where you bring in the AI the 5G, the distributed computing, things like that. Some of our vertical technologies like hypersonic, we're going to do just fine in that, now we may buy individual M&A opportunities or targets to be able to fill ourselves in or do more mission system work in a technology like that, but I think it's more horizontal than vertical Myles to be answered quickly.\nOperator: Our next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good morning Jim. Ken, can I ask you a question on just the order environment? You had a really strong quarter. I think Jim mentioned $22 billion in orders of 1.4 book-to-bill, but maybe you could just highlight some of the international pursuits that are still in front of you. And if you are seeing any kind of delays or chatter because of COVID-19, and maybe just how that -- will you expect to still come in this year in 2020? Thanks.\nKenneth Possenriede: Thanks. Good morning, Peter. Thanks for the question. Yes, we still see some great opportunities out there specifically, internationally. We're not seeing that much slipped to the right, I'd say the only thing we may be seeing to the right, are the requests for proposal, solicitations we are moving to the right but they are holding firm to the end dates. But to answer your question specifically, a couple of things that we have out there that are quite large or we have a indefinite quantity and definite delivery F-16 order coming. The [indiscernible] key customer is Taiwan, and another country customer that should get announced sometime in this quarter. Think of that as an additional 90 aircraft for F-16 which we're quite pleased with. There is a C-130. Indonesia order that we're also anticipating happens later this year. There is some follow on work for the recently announced India Navy's MH-60R program that we got earlier, those are the main -- mainly the large ones we also have an [indiscernible], Japan order that we're anticipating later this year. And then of course there's a variety of F-35 production orders that we plan to book later this year that rough numbers 40% of those quantities will be of international nature. Going into next year, we see -- we also continue to see some strong demand for specifically F-16, our Integrated Air and Missile Defense. In parallel with our customer, we're pursuing a CH-53K order in Germany and in Israel that should get -- we'll shape that this year and hopefully get that award in a competition sometime next year. So there are a lot of international opportunities out there and really not seeing a lot of slowdown in -- from an order book standpoint.\nJames Taiclet: John, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: Great. And that will be from Robert Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much, and good morning.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning.\nRobert Stallard: [indiscernible] I think is the way you guys describe it. I think just like to follow up on what Noah was asking about, not asking you to necessarily speculate on where the U.S. Defense budget could go to. But maybe to follow up on your introductory comments about the challenges in National Security, are these challenges around resources or is it around your folding the capabilities the U.S. will need to address national security threats going forward? And also could you elaborate a little bit more on that. Thank you.\nJames Taiclet: I would characterize the challenges or the pursuits that China and Russia are taking to regain status as peer competitors, the United States in this field. And when you get into the depths of what's going on, it's concerning from someone who's been in this space, my whole career off and on. So that's the real challenges, we've got a country that in the form of China, which is getting very aggressive in their actions, their attitudes and their aspirations and they're investing in capabilities. Some of them are symmetric, and some of them are asymmetric to find our vulnerable spots in our traditional way of running our defense operations and trying to get ahead of us in those especially vulnerable spots. So there's got to be a lot of investment and a lot of technology investment to firm up those vulnerable places in our defense posture. And that's what I would characterize as the big challenge. And Russia on the strategic side, whether it's hypersonic missiles or other fairly strategic threat type elements is back in the game and investing too. So they may not be the great land army, they were in the 1980s and threatening Europe in that way. But they've gone to a technological threat posture, which allows them to do it from a greater distance. And we'll look with a much smaller military organization, if you will.\nGreg Gardner: And gentlemen, just past the hour, so I think I will turn it back over to Jim now for some final thoughts.\nJames Taiclet: Sure, as I conclude the call today. I do want to thank the employees of Lockheed Martin for their contributions and dedication during this time of global pandemic. They performed with excellent supporting our customers and their important missions. And I'm extremely proud of them and to be part of Lockheed Martin team now with 110,000 plus other teammates. So thank you again, everyone on the call today for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in October and have a great rest of the week.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "James Taiclet",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. It's a pleasure to be here on my first Lockheed Martin's earnings call, and I look forward to working with all of you. I hope this call finds you and your families safe and healthy. The world continues to combat the coronavirus outbreak while it is striving to recover and sustain economic activity. Our primary objective at Lockheed Martin is to ensure the health and welfare of our employees and their families, our teammates, customers, and communities. We remain vigilant taking the necessary steps to help protect our workforce while producing the products and solutions our customers need to achieve their important readiness objectives. Our business areas have taken actions including implementing alternative work schedules, health and safety checks at our facilities, and telework wherever possible. Most recently, our Aeronautics team established a rotational facility plan for our F-35 production line, allowing us to continue to manufacture the aircraft while practicing social distancing and completing regular deep cleanings. The corporation also continues to support our critical industrial base suppliers, frontline medical workers, and our local communities with COVID-19 relief and response. In March, the Department of Defense announced it would increase progress payment rates to large businesses from 80% to 90% accelerating payments for the completion of work in recognition of the challenges posed by COVID-19. The DoD's expectation was that prime contractors would flow these accelerated payments to the supply chain. Through the second quarter Lockheed Martin has flowed all of the accelerated payments the corporation has received from the Department of Defense, $1.3 billion in total to our supply chain. In this process, we've given priority to small and vulnerable suppliers as we continue our efforts to promote a healthy and sustainable defense industrial base. We've also continued to support our local communities and to date have made substantial donations to non-profit organizations involved in COVID-19 related relief and assistance with emphasis on veterans and military families. And as a global organization employing thousands across the world, we are supporting related initiatives in 15 different countries, including donations to food banks, healthcare facilities, distance learning, and research efforts to help combat this disease. This corporation has hired more than 9,000 new employees across United States since the crisis began and is advertising for another 3,000 positions. We remain on track with plans to hire approximately 12,000 employees during 2020. And across the country, we produced more than 65,000 protective gowns and 30,000 face shields, and we've donated PPE at 174 locations where frontline medical workers are caring for COVID-19 patients and others of risk. Through all these initiatives, Lockheed Martin remains committed to supporting our employees, our suppliers, and communities in which our company operates through the course of this ongoing pandemic. Ken will review our first quarter financials and updated full-year outlook in more detail in a few minutes. As you've seen from our press release, we had a very strong quarter financially despite the effects of the coronavirus. Mitigation plans put in place by each of our business areas, their teammates and supply chain, the international community, as well as strong support from the Department of Defense and broad U.S. government actions have allowed us to minimize the financial impacts on our company. This coupled with outstanding operational performance have enabled us to increase our full year outlook for sales, earnings, EPS, and cash from operations. Sales in the quarter were 12% greater than last year, as all the four business areas increased from 2019. Our segment operating profit results were also strong, growing 15% year-over-year, driven by both higher sales growth and an increase in segment profit margin to 11%. We had a strong quarter of cash generation, bringing in over $2.2 billion of cash from operations and executed our balanced cash deployment strategy. Moving to new business activities, we received nearly $22 billion in orders this quarter, raising our backlog to over $150 billion, a new high watermark. Our Aeronautics business area led the company with over $9 billion of orders, including $7 billion of total orders booked for the F-35. We were able to add 84 jets to the program with the finalization of two Lot 14 production contracts, bringing the current number of planes in our backlog to 411 aircraft. Our F-35 team also added approximately $1 billion in combined sustainment and development awards this quarter as well. Missiles and Fire Control also had a strong quarter, with the Defense Department announcing several PAC-3 awards, including one for over $6 billion to supply PAC-3 MSE interceptors, launcher modification kits, and associated equipment to support the United States and foreign military sales customers across multiple contract years. These awards demonstrate the global demand for PAC-3 MSE interceptors and to meet that demand this year, we began work on an 85,000 square foot building expansion at our Camden, Arkansas facility. The building is expected to be completed by fourth quarter 2021 with operations they're beginning in the first quarter of 2022.  Our Rotary and Mission Systems secured orders of over $1 billion to support and supply 24 MH-60 Romeo helicopters to the Government of India. These Sikorsky SEAHAWK aircraft will provide Maritime Anti-Surface and Anti-Submarine Warfare capabilities to India, as well as cargo, utility, and search and rescue missions. And our Space business area added multiple orders including a classified award for over $1 billion. In total, the corporation grew orders 23% above second quarter 2019 and achieved a companywide book-to-bill ratio of nearly 1.4 for the quarter. I'll touch briefly now on the Department of Defense budgets as both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees have completed the respective markups of the fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act. Each version adheres to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 spending targets and equal approximately $740 billion for national defense. Appropriation committees from each chamber are in the process of drafting the funding legislation to accompany the authorization. There are encouraging elements for our portfolio as the Senate version confirmed that the national defense strategy remains the roadmap for the armed services, and the bill was passed with strong bipartisan support. Our portfolio was well supported in the Senate version for the recommended increase of 16 F-35 aircraft above the President's request, additional funding for Missile Defense priorities including an 8 THAAD battery, and increased funding for the Homeland Defense Radar-Hawaii program. Congress will continue with the authorization and appropriation phases. We look forward to the finalization of the process and supporting our warfighters needs. Moving on, I'd like to highlight several significant events that occurred across the corporation during the past quarter. Beginning with Aeronautics, the F-35 team achieved another operational milestone, as our United Kingdom partner celebrated the initial carrier deployment of its 617 Squadron. This legendary unit, known as the Dambusters from their exploits in World War II is now aboard the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrier. The Squadron will now begin a series of flight trials demonstrating the jets ability to defend the carrier who Combat Air Patrols, rapid deployment and interoperability with other U.K. Naval assets. This is all in preparation for their second embarkation later in the year, when the Squadron will join the carrier and her task group for a large multinational training exercise with U.S., European and NATO partners. The ship will then set sail again next year for her maiden Global Carrier Strike Group 21 deployment. We're proud to provide this unrivaled fifth generation aircraft to help support our U.K. partner in the security of their nation. Moving to RMS, our radar surveillance systems team achieved two notable milestones this quarter. In April, they successfully completed the Sentinel A4 Radar Program preliminary design review, following successful system requirement and system functional reviews, which took place earlier this year. So just four months after the initial contract award, the Sentinel team has already achieved several key milestones as it progresses the critical design review phase later this year, and then in a fabrication, demonstration and test. The Sentinel A4 Radar replaces the current A3 variant and will provide improved Air and Missile Defense against low flying unmanned aerial systems, cruise missiles, drones and other threats. For the program of record of approximately 200 systems plus international partnerships the Sentinel Program alone has a total potential contract value of over $3 billion. RMS also delivered to the U.S. Army, the first AN/TPQ-53 radar system, which is equipped with Gallium Nitride to provide additional power and enhanced counter fire target acquisition capabilities. The TPQ-53 radar locates and tracks enemy indirect fire, neither a 360 degree or a 90 degree mode and it was first deployed in 2010 to Iraq and Afghanistan, where it delivered outstanding performance and reliability to defend our troops. We are currently in [4A] production to provide approximately 190 units with a contract value at $1.6 billion. The both the Sentinel A4 and the TPQ-53 are part of Lockheed Martin's open scalable radar architecture, the cornerstone of each of these systems design, which allows for upgrades that will not only extend the lives of the radars but evolve their capabilities over the next 40 or so years. In Missiles and Fire Control, our Air and Missile Defense line of business mark the delivery of the 500 FAD interceptor to the U.S. Army. The FADprogram is a key part of the U.S. Missile Defense System has been selected by multiple international partners to support their national security. MFC continues to expand our production facilities to accommodate that demand. This quarter our space business area, as part of the Blue Origin National Team in this really is exciting and was down selected for the next phase of the human landing system for NASA's Artemis program. The Artemis program is the country's ambitious endeavor to land humans on the moon in 2024 and return them safely to Earth. Leveraging designs and technologies used on our Orion program, Lockheed Martin will produce the crew ascent element, the vehicle which will transport astronauts from the lunar surface to begin their journey back to earth. We look forward to supporting this remarkable mission and continue long running out of legacy of supporting NASA mission. Before I turn over the call to Ken, I'd like to take a moment to thank Marillyn Hewson for her years of leadership and express how honored I am to have the opportunity to lead Lockheed Martin, a company that I consider a national asset. My experiences as an Air Force pilot, flying Lockheed Martin Aircraft and Operation Desert Shield helped shape my belief that helping to provide for the defense of our nation and its allies, is one of the most important endeavors that one can undertake. When presented with the opportunity to become President and Chief Executive Officer here, I viewed it not as a job offer but as a call to service. Moreover, Marillyn and her Executive Team has positioned the company for even greater success for the future, and I'm eager to deliver on that prospect. Since becoming CEO about a month ago, I've met Hewson virtually with a significant number of our key government customers to introduce myself, reaffirm our commitment to performance and affordability and get their feedback. I've been pleased with the broad response of confidence and Lockheed Martin is a key partner, but also the candid discussions on the challenges we jointly face in the National Security Space. There's great appreciation for the technologies and solutions we provide. And we have a long heritage of innovation for our customers. I plan to continue this legacy as well as pursue a long-term strategy to deliver enhanced capabilities to support what I call the 21st century war-fighter concept. That concept endeavors to bring relevant lessons in the latest technologies from the broader tech sector to the defense industrial base. I believe Lockheed Martin is uniquely positioned to address this and other evolving security needs of our nation and its allies. And I'm excited to have this opportunity. I've also had the chance to meet with many of you in our Investor Community in recent weeks that engage in conversations and I look to continuing that dialogue. As you can tell, I'm quite convinced that we can further leverage our key platform positions and broad portfolio to drive a long-term value to our shareholders while furthering both National Defense and Scientific Discovery. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Good morning. Sure, David, good morning. This company to me is incredibly well positioned for any reasonable range of outcomes in defense spending in the economy over the next few years as well as -- as breadth of product and service that is really essential to the National Defense strategy. So when you put the two things together, I think the company, vis-a\u0300-vis peers is incredibly well positioned relative to others. The backlog of $150 billion is equipment and services that the customer needs, they've already signed up and budgeted for. And again, there are ways to solve both opportunity sets. One is if there's a rising defense budget or stable one, we can continue to deliver on that backlog just as it's contracted, but if it changes, those requirements are still going to need to be met. And because of our platform position, David, we can extend and broaden the capabilities of existing platforms, make sure that their life can be extended while at the same time of being upgraded to whatever standard is required at that point in time. So, I think the breadth of the Company's portfolio of products, services, and domains that we operate in is going to position us well even at a downturn, frankly. Secondly, on long-term growth, that's -- the threats aren't going away. Defense is going to have to be supported, I think in any reasonable person's view going forward, especially if those people are in positions of responsibility no matter what party they may come from. So I view that defense has got to be an important priority for the country. Going forward, there may be a mix change, if you will, but it's still going to be an important priority. Again, the benefit of coming in the door here is the existing portfolio position of the company across the services, domains, international space, et cetera. That broad platform is a risk mitigator in my opinion, to a downturn and say the defense spending trajectory. So on the upside, the innovation gene at this company is fantastic. So when you can apply that innovation genetic framework to the broad portfolio that we have and I hope bring in some tech industry practices and maybe some new partnerships and technologies to augment that I think the upside for long-term growth is really tremendous. And on the R&D front, if we can get our customers convinced that certain types of independent research and development needs to be compensated for perhaps new ways by the government, so the companies like ours and others can take risks, so we can bring in partners that are willing to take risk, at least knowing they may have a path to compensation at the end of the day, and then we're going to be able to accelerate our growth. So we're in a great position to try to work in any environment I think, whether it's defense spending, technology deployment, I've got an idea called 5G.mil that we're going to try to figure out how to create and really bring that technology as just one example, entire [ph]space and drive performance at this company as a result of that. Yes, I'm pleased to say that Ken's already applying it as we speak and before I got here, so I was really glad to see that that's a capital allocation decisions have historically been made here. I think that my experience at American Tower, we used a wide variety of vehicles to deploy capital, get others to do it on our behalf and in partnership with us. And maybe we can add some of those elements here, and some might be pre-existing relationships in the tech sector and telecom to join us in some of this investment profile. But, I do think that that we can continue to drive cash flow per share growth here and ROIC stability or expansion at the same time we did at American Tower over a 20-year period. And I think we can do it here too. Hi. You bet. Good morning. Thank you. So Jon, this is Jim. Ken just gave you a great landscape picture of the whole the scenery here, and I can go ahead and pick up on one thing he did say about maybe something you were looking for in your question, too, is, what would we do different potentially in a downturn on capital allocation, and just to recap the dividends there it's going to be a growing dividend in our view at least Ken and mine and the Board I expect would agree with us. But in a downturn in my historical, recent experience, and my philosophy here is that may be also presenting an opportunity for us if there is a downturn, we're going to look at the silver linings that may be there. And whether it's M&A and other investments. So if you add together the scale of Lockheed Martin in the cash flow that comes from that, they can just define the backlog on top of it the extends out into time and the balance sheet strength that we have, there could be opportunities for us to act in a time period where asset prices are depressed for things that we may want to bring into the company or JV with or whatever. And so that's just another way to picture it, is it the strength and the breadth and the foundation this company allow -- could allow us as it did in my prior experience to get assets we really wanted. That might be even more available at attractive prices, which then drive the nice ROI that you want the cash flow growth to come with it? Good, Rich. Good morning. Yes, good morning, Rich, I'll take that. So you're right. We have provided [OSD] the Department of Defense [indiscernible] based on what we see as impacts to Lockheed Martin and its supply chain that go out to September. We just had a few internal conversations and we're starting to have conversations with the customer probably make sense since that is already stale, this is a fluid situation probably makes sense for us to update that rough order of magnitude and it may make sense for it to -- for us to extend it beyond September. We'll go through that with them. Regarding what, what we're assuming from a sales and margin standpoint, what we're generally seeing Rich, is these impacts are out farther than we thought the three months ago, and probably more in the \u201821 time period. And maybe a little bit in the fourth quarter of this time period. So if there is not a deal, the grand deal, I think, the next course of action would be for us to go work individually with our respective customers to negotiate on a case-by-case basis, what the impacts are to us. And what are not, the issue is going to be, the available funding for that. If there's not funding, these are all allowable costs. And, then the question becomes -- we put that into our forward pricing rates, and there might be some modest impacts to a couple of our programs but that would be probably more at the profit level, not at the top line. And right now we don't see that playing out as advertised. So it's fluid and we're working through this with our customers. Sure, Cai. There's a number of approaches to this. Again, in my previous experience, we were embarking on this for commercial 5G applications, which is Internet-of-Things at scale including autonomous land and air vehicles. So that's happening in the tech sector now. So there's a 5G standards of that there's computing, which is storage and processing of data that's moving to the edge of the network and intermediate places from data centers to the edge. And there's the autonomous vehicle infrastructure and devices, we call them edge devices over in the tech side, that are being built, you think of them as the driverless car, et cetera, et cetera. So all of those elements are being processed a page, it's going to take time, by the way to do any of this in the commercial space. And those practices can be brought over, I think, to the defense industrial base. But only quickly if our customer comes along with us and changes some of the procurement practices, how we can get paid for things, there's a licensing regime that you may be aware of in the telecom space, particularly that enables global standards to be built. And then each participant or competitor designed to that global standard. That's how you can get 2G, 3G, 4G, 5G done in a space of 20 years when it takes that long to get one defense program done. So those are the kind of practices I think we can migrate over with some of those partners that are working on these things on the commercial side. Now, again, this is a long cycle initiative. Is it is on the commercial industry to it's going to require cooperation with our customer, and they're authorizing us to try some of these things. Because no one's going to take any risk on the defense industrial base by implementing these technologies in a different way. If they're not sure they're going to get paid for it. So we've got a lot to do. But frankly, it -- in American Tower we endeavor to change the industry to go from where transmission sites for telecom networks were non-performing cost centers inside the telephone companies and we converted them through commercial practices and basically, sale leaseback type of approach. We turn those assets into performing assets for commercial companies like ours that were able to create value for shareholders over a long arc of time. So this can be done. But it's going to take time, it's going to require just like it required American Tower, the cooperation of our customers, who were then the telephone companies to work with us and engage in this. And the only reason they did was because they could deploy their networks faster, get capital from us to do it and also to have a lower total cost of ownership for the site over time. And when you multiply that by, we have 180,000 sites back in my prior company, we basically help change the industry, not just us, but around the world. That's the kind of aspiration we have here at Lockheed Martin, and we are in a position to do it, and I would argue a way better position than we ever were back in the in the tower and digital infrastructure industry 15, 20 years ago. So that's the aspiration, Cai how to do it we know, we've got a great example on commercial telephony and technology and how they collaborate through standards bodies and other mechanisms in JVs and alliances to get this done. And so those are the kinds of practices we can bring over. It's not easy. It's not going to happen in a hurry. But the benefit again, Lockheed Martin has is the backlog is so strong on what I call the product centric way of doing defense industrial based business, that we've got time. And we can perform as we try to also move the industry towards a network centric way of doing business. Good morning. Good morning. Noah, it's Jim. I tried to not speculate on the behavior of people that are going to make independent decisions that we can't predict. So we're just getting the company ready for either scenario frankly, if it's stable, slightly rising or moderately rising defense budget, we know how to handle that. But if it's a declining defense budget, we're planning for that too. So we can't predict one way or the other that the behavior of human beings, whether it's six months from now, or whenever they're going to make these kinds of decisions, but what we can do is prepare for both scenarios. And that's exactly what we're doing. All of our BAs are looking at all their programs and saying if and they're planning this under Ken's guidance, if there's a downturn in defense defending, which I've asked every BA to look at and get back into the integrated plan, if in that scenario, it's a red team kind of an exercise, what would we do? It's a contingency plan that says, okay, we would offer with -- to our customers to say, look if your budget is x minus y. This is what we think you should do with our products and programs for extending lives and other things like that. And with the backlog we have in the orders in track and the production lines that are going into supply chains that operate is going to be two to three years before those defense budget cuts actually flow into the defense industrial base production line. So we've got time to work with a customer to make sure that that they can have their contingency plan and we're behind and we're working with them 100%. Good morning. So by operating segment, each of those businesses with the corporate support they've had, they're great at what they do, I'm probably not going to make a better missile design than people in MFC can make so, what I think my benefit or add value added might be as cross cutting those BAs in a way that hadn't been done before here or anywhere else. And then linking them with a customer to do what the customer is literally asking us for, which is how do we connect equipment, systems, communication networks, across what they call domains. So how can I have satellite, get a signal from an F-35, then goes back to a ground based Missile Defense System to hit incoming threat to, up one of our installations? That's what they really want. Not any single one of our business areas or any other companies, frankly, I think could give them that, that solution. So we're working with, our recently hired CTO who was previously running DARPA to look horizontally across what are the missions that the DoD and our allies need to do? And what BAs and what BAs do we have the assets, resources and time technical capabilities to provide them that horizontal solution. So our typical backlog, we're providing what I call vertical solutions, we're providing products, platform, services, generally to one service, the F-35 and exception of course, but to one service, maybe just the one country, but we're going to need to link across services better we're going to need to link across our allies better. And we're -- and that's what this network solution is really about in my mind. So that's what I think Myles we can bring our tech world partners and, and U.S. and other allied countries, companies into this to make us better horizontally. I'm not sure they can even make us all that better, vertically, all that often, but horizontally, I think we can. And that's where you bring in the AI the 5G, the distributed computing, things like that. Some of our vertical technologies like hypersonic, we're going to do just fine in that, now we may buy individual M&A opportunities or targets to be able to fill ourselves in or do more mission system work in a technology like that, but I think it's more horizontal than vertical Myles to be answered quickly. John, I think we have time for one more question. Good morning. I would characterize the challenges or the pursuits that China and Russia are taking to regain status as peer competitors, the United States in this field. And when you get into the depths of what's going on, it's concerning from someone who's been in this space, my whole career off and on. So that's the real challenges, we've got a country that in the form of China, which is getting very aggressive in their actions, their attitudes and their aspirations and they're investing in capabilities. Some of them are symmetric, and some of them are asymmetric to find our vulnerable spots in our traditional way of running our defense operations and trying to get ahead of us in those especially vulnerable spots. So there's got to be a lot of investment and a lot of technology investment to firm up those vulnerable places in our defense posture. And that's what I would characterize as the big challenge. And Russia on the strategic side, whether it's hypersonic missiles or other fairly strategic threat type elements is back in the game and investing too. So they may not be the great land army, they were in the 1980s and threatening Europe in that way. But they've gone to a technological threat posture, which allows them to do it from a greater distance. And we'll look with a much smaller military organization, if you will. Sure, as I conclude the call today. I do want to thank the employees of Lockheed Martin for their contributions and dedication during this time of global pandemic. They performed with excellent supporting our customers and their important missions. And I'm extremely proud of them and to be part of Lockheed Martin team now with 110,000 plus other teammates. So thank you again, everyone on the call today for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in October and have a great rest of the week."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Kenneth Possenriede",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Jim, and welcome aboard, and good morning to everyone. As Jim noted, I also hope that each of you are doing well and staying safe. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. So let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results and year-over-year growth in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter. We delivered $16.2 billion in sales, $1.8 billion in segment operating profit and $5.79 in earnings per share, which included a non-cash charge related to an international joint venture that we are now exiting. We generated $2.2 billion of cash from operations and we continue to execute our balance cash deployment plan for 2020 returning almost $1 billion to our shareholders. We achieved a new record backlog of greater than $150 billion exceeding our all time high for the corporation for the eighth consecutive quarter. We have updated our full year guidance increasing our estimates for sales, earnings and operating cash flow as COVID-19 mitigation plans and our outstanding performance and minimize our year-to-date impacts. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the business in challenging times. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 12% to $16.2 billion led by volume in Aeronautics and Missiles and Fire Control, while segment operating profit increased 15% led by earnings growth and Aero and RMS. The resulting segment operating margin was a strong 11% for the second quarter. These results include the impacts caused by COVID-19 and reflect the proactive efforts of Lockheed Martin in our customers to mitigate these disruptions, particularly as they apply to our supply chain. And as we have closely monitored this evolving situation, it has become apparent that some of the impact we anticipated will be realized in the second half of 2020 versus being contained primarily in 2Q. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for 2Q, 2020. Our EPS of $5.79 was up $0.79 over results of last year, driven by our sales volume increase favorable performance and additional FAS/CAS income and excluding the $0.34 for the impairment of the international joint venture we are exiting, the second quarter earnings per share would have been $6.13. On Chart 6, we will discuss in more detail the cash returned to our shareholders this quarter. We also had a strong quarter of cash flow generating $2.2 billion in cash from operations. We continue to invest in capital projects to support long-term growth, which resulted in over $1.8 billion of free cash flow. We paid out dividends of $2.40 per share and repurchased $259 million worth of shares. And year-to-date, we have now repurchased over $1 billion in shares fulfilling our 2020 outlook. Our ability to consistently generate strong cash flow allows us to continue with our long standing balanced cash deployment strategy. Let's move on to Chart 7, strong operational performance in all business areas have allowed us to increase our outlook for all financial metrics, as we continue to implement mitigation actions to combat the coronavirus. We are now projecting full year sales growth of 7% over 2019 with consistent segment profit margins, and we've increased our cash flow by $400 million to greater than or equal to $8 billion. On Chart 8, we will break out the increased sales guidance by business area. We have adjusted our estimates for Aeronautics, Space and RMS, increasing the midpoint of our sales range by $1.125 billion. And based on our current assessment of the full year, while COVID-19 has caused disruption in our supply chain and as some of our key locations, we have had non-COVID performance that has offset the impacts and gives us confidence to increase our 2020 outlook. On Chart 9, we show the corresponding increases to segment operating profit by business area, again led by Aeronautics, Space and RMS. And in total, we have raised the midpoint of our segment operating profit guidance by $100 million. And to conclude, on Chart 10, we have our summary. We had a strong quarter, both operationally and financially and we have increased our full year outlook for all metrics. We had another quarter of backlog growth, our eighth in a row, a reflection of the strength provided by our broad portfolio. We continue to closely monitor the environment and evolving conditions in our business related to COVID-19. And we remain committed to providing long-term value to our customers and our shareholders. And with that, John, we are ready to begin the Q&A. Good morning, Rob. So yes, Missiles and Fire Control is the one that we did not adjust guidance. So, you're exactly right. Just to remind everybody, it is still our fastest growing business area, still most profitable business area. But going around the horn, and it's a little bit of what I talked about in the first quarter, our biggest concern from a COVID impact standpoint was clearly at Aeronautics and clearly the main driver -- main concern at Aeronautics is F-35, and we've done a good job of anticipating that in the quarter and hence the results you saw in the quarter. We had really strong results at Missiles and Fire Control in the second quarter frankly and in the first half. You're right, if you look at where we're going, we're holding guidance. We do see COVID impacts. This is a very high-volume business, so we are starting to see some pressure on Hellfire deliveries and ATACM deliveries regarding -- and mainly driven by COVID. But, we're going to be up year-over-year mid-single digit from a growth standpoint in the second half, so still pleased with the trajectory of where the business is going. Let's see your second question on guidance for F-35. Yes, second quarter, we saw strong growth across F-35. Follow on modernization we've received some awards in the quarter that resulted in strong sales growth year-over-year. In fact, we'll see that into the second half of the year. Production, if you recall, we had a little bit of a slow start in the first quarter and that was basically timing of supplier payments to us that picked up in the second quarter, but really strong production growth in the second quarter and sustainment is up as well. And so for the year, we're looking at double-digit growth for F-35. Overall, we're seeing development up really strong, sustainment really strong and production mid single-digits, which is higher than what we thought. Thank you, George. So yes, in the quarter, F-35 was up very, very strong on the top line growth, there production was up strong sustainment of strong as I mentioned on the previous question. If you look at margins, from a production standpoint, they were strong double-digit. We had some risk retirements on a few of our production lots. So it wasn't just [blocked by] but it was a few of our previous lots that actually are still open. So we had some retirements, their development so FCD, the FCD has wound down. That was a low margin business for us. And now, we're embarking on follow on modernization with our customer. And we're seeing strong -- though its cost plus we are seeing stronger margins that we did on FCD think of those as high single-digit margins. And then on sustainment, we had a variety of risk retirement, not one single sustainment program that I could spike out, but there's a variety of sustainment programs that had some risk retirements in the quarter so, so you're right on that a strong quarter from a margin standpoint. Second half, we're not anticipating the risk retirements that we had in the -- in this quarter George and your other question was looking at the high end of the guidance. So though we think we have done a very good job with our customer mitigating a lot of the risks due to COVID in the second quarter, where we are starting to see risks specifically in Texas and specifically in our supply chain due to COVID. And we do anticipate seeing a couple of hundred million dollar impacts specifically on F-35 production, top line due to COVID risks. And so to your question is that being conservative, it's only conservative if COVID does not happen, but if it happens, we feel comfortable with our midpoint of guidance and our high end of guidance. Thanks, Jon. Hi, good morning. It's Ken, I hope you're well as well. So I'll take that, Jon, we're committed to providing still significant portion of our cash flow to our shareholders that's regardless of, what happens, what this downturn looks like. But, I'll \u2013 I will start with cash. And we just took our cash up to the greater than or equal to $8 billion this year. We have some tailwinds. And frankly, this year we have some headwinds and with that balance in what we see, with our working capital improvements, we were comfortable doing that. One thing I'll say going out to the future, and it's based on our strong backlog and it's what I'll call our culture of cash. I've mentioned in the past that we're comfortable right now even with the headwinds that we see out in 2021 of $7.7 billion based on what we see right now, we're comfortable taking that up $100 million to $7.8 billion. And then out to 2022 we talked about the pre-tax change for the amortization of R&D that we saw a path to roughly $7.8 billion in 2022. We're comfortable today taking that up another $100 million. So think of just cash that could be used for internal investments and for cash deployment up $400 million this year up $100 million next year, and up $100 in 2022. We've talked about capital this year and next year are probably the highest capital spends we're going to have think rough numbers, about [$1.07] billion this year, though, there is an appetite to spend more at the business areas, but right now, we're forecasting [$1.07] billion and probably [$1.07] billion next year, which gives us still very strong, free cash flow going forward. We're committed to the dividend, there's absolutely no question. That is our priority. And we don't see that changing in the future. Jim and I will go to the Board to recommend a change to our dividend rate in the September timeframe for the next four quarters. Based on what we see today, it's -- for planning purposes, we should assume high single-digit increases. I think for planning purposes. That's what we'll plan going out into the futures. I still think repos, repos has a place for us. We've talked about the $1 billion this year, we've done about [$1.01ish] billion through July, we're now going to pause at least in the near-term, it makes sense for us to do that based on this COVID environment. And just from a planning standpoint, we should assume $1 billion in 2021 and 2022. And think of that is to prevent dilution in our share count. And as you mentioned, and Jim has talked about this other investments we need to make. We have the balance sheet to do that we have the cash flow to do that. And you saw in the second quarter, we did flow of [$1.150] billion a debt. We did that opportunistically got a great yield on that money. And we're -- we'll continue looking at whether it makes sense for us to go into the debt market, whether it's for organic or inorganic investments. Seems like the summary is that the 2020 guidance is not greatly affected in either direction, whether the stimulus goes through or not. Yes so, whether it hits this year, next year or all years Seth it is important, it's important to the industry. And it's not just Lockheed Martin it would be across our entire supply base. As I mentioned this is fluid, it's got a lot of moving parts. It probably just for our financials, it will -- it modestly in the second half of the year, but then probably hit more and ripple through the supply chain in the first half of 2021 is our best assessment. Mechanically, the way this could work if it was a big settlement, we still have to go through the details, but I'm guessing that the expectation would be so pick the F-35 a brand settlement, I think the expectation internally just from a program performance standpoint and at the customer level, they would want those costs and those budgets if you will to flow into those respective programs. I'm going to speculate that there probably would be some kind of clip level, from a dollar threshold standpoint that we would utilize with the customer set of what gets flow to the program. So there probably is a point where it's going to be a diminishing return and cost more to implement that across programs and not. Assuming if there's not a grant deal I think what you would see is each program would deal with a case-by-case and then mechanically, that's how that would happen. And it would be a sales impact, a cash impact and an EBIT impact across each respective programs. But, what you're talking about ballpark -- whatever our number is, it's -- we're a $65 billion, round up to $65 billion company. It's not going to be that material to our bottom line specifically if it's over a multitude of years. So we'll see, we'll see where this goes. I think this has got to take some time to play out still. Thanks. Good morning, Peter. Thanks for the question. Yes, we still see some great opportunities out there specifically, internationally. We're not seeing that much slipped to the right, I'd say the only thing we may be seeing to the right, are the requests for proposal, solicitations we are moving to the right but they are holding firm to the end dates. But to answer your question specifically, a couple of things that we have out there that are quite large or we have a indefinite quantity and definite delivery F-16 order coming. The [indiscernible] key customer is Taiwan, and another country customer that should get announced sometime in this quarter. Think of that as an additional 90 aircraft for F-16 which we're quite pleased with. There is a C-130. Indonesia order that we're also anticipating happens later this year. There is some follow on work for the recently announced India Navy's MH-60R program that we got earlier, those are the main -- mainly the large ones we also have an [indiscernible], Japan order that we're anticipating later this year. And then of course there's a variety of F-35 production orders that we plan to book later this year that rough numbers 40% of those quantities will be of international nature. Going into next year, we see -- we also continue to see some strong demand for specifically F-16, our Integrated Air and Missile Defense. In parallel with our customer, we're pursuing a CH-53K order in Germany and in Israel that should get -- we'll shape that this year and hopefully get that award in a competition sometime next year. So there are a lot of international opportunities out there and really not seeing a lot of slowdown in -- from an order book standpoint."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.\nMarillyn Hewson: Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope this call finds you and your family safe and healthy as we collectively work to address the many issues brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. Our nation and the global community have seen the dramatic effects of the COVID-19 crisis. We are all saddened by the rise in illness and the tragic loss of life that has resulted from it, and our Lockheed Martin family has not been spared from this pandemic. The world continues to battle this disease, with experts predicting improvements will be seen in the coming weeks and months. And while this is certainly encouraging, we must remain vigilant to ensure progress is achieved. The corporation is taking necessary steps to help combat this virus and keep our employees safe while assuring our customers can achieve their important readiness and mission requirements. We are beginning to experience some issues in each of our business areas related to the coronavirus, primarily in access to some locations and delays of supplier deliveries, which have caused us to adjust our full year sales outlook, and we will discuss that later in the call. Our teams are successfully addressing many of the risks that have arisen due to the COVID-19 impacts. Our manufacturing facilities are open, and our workforce is engaged. The situation will evolve, and we will continue to monitor our business environment for areas of concern. The corporation remains committed to delivering the products and services needed for our customers and to maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for our employees. In recognition of this unprecedented situation, the U.S. government has taken several actions that continue to reinforce the importance of our nation's defense industry. The Department of Homeland Security deems the defense industrial base to be part of the nation's essential critical infrastructure. And the Department of Defense has issued guidance that confirms the expectation that companies providing products and services in support of national security continue to maintain staffing and work schedules to perform their crucial functions. The DoD also published a deviation on progress payments memo, issuing a blanket increase to progress payment rates for both large and small businesses. Stable and reliable cash inflows provide needed visibility for all businesses and will be especially important to many small and medium-sized suppliers. These actions underscore the country's commitment to our industry and importantly, to our supply chain, which provides tremendous innovation and strength to our national security products. The international community is also deeply affected by this crisis. And our company is committed to perform with excellence for our global customers and to support the health and well-being of our employees around the world. The corporation is taking steps to aid our employees, teammates and others. And in a few moments, I will discuss some of the actions we have taken to help provide support to those affected by this crisis. I will touch briefly now on the Department of Defense budgets and the recent presidential budget submission. This quarter, the President submitted the fiscal year 2021 budget recommendation to Congress, consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 enacted values, with the total national defense request equaling approximately $741 billion. Notably, the DoD reiterated their commitment to the national defense strategy and their submission, with the space domain, air and missile defense and hypersonic programs, key pillars in their strategy and our portfolio, all receiving increases from the previous submissions. Congress will continue to process with the authorization and appropriations phases. Our programs remain well supported, and our portfolio is broad and expanding. We look forward to the finalization of the process and supporting our warfighters' needs. Ken will review our first quarter financials and updated full year outlook in more detail in a few minutes. I would like to begin by noting that the disruptions introduced by this virus have caused us to reduce our 2020 sales expectation as production and supply chain activities have recently slowed in our Aeronautics business area. The changes in our outlook represent impacts we anticipate being recognized over the remainder of the year. We are not projecting any changes due to our expected full year operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations outlooks that we set forth in January. Our results this quarter were very strong. Sales in the quarter exceeded last year's first quarter by more than 9%, led by our Aeronautics team as the Aeronautics business area grew 14% from the first quarter of 2019. Our segment profit came in just above the first quarter 2019 amount as risk retirements in all business areas allowed us to exceed our expectations in this quarter. And we had a strong quarter of cash generation, bringing in over $2.3 billion of cash from operations as we look to achieve our full year target of greater than or equal to $7.6 billion. Moving to orders and backlog. We received more than $15 billion in orders this quarter, maintaining our backlog at approximately $144 billion, our all-time high. RMS garnered the largest set of awards, with the total exceeding $7 billion, led by our Sikorsky organization, which booked over $4 billion of orders, including over $2 billion for a performance-based logistics contract for the U.S. Navy to provide sustainment services on our MH-60 SEAHAWK platform; and award of $500 million for the second low-rate initial production, or LRIP, contract for 12 combat rescue helicopters; and $470 million awards -- award for LRIP 2 of the presidential helicopter contract, adding 6 aircraft to the program and bringing the total order to 12 rotary aircraft out of a total program of record of 23 aircraft. Aeronautics also had a strong quarter, with aggregate F-35 orders approaching $900 million. Other awards, including a new classified order, brought the Aeronautics business area total to $3.6 billion for the quarter. Missiles and Fire Control received a pair of sizable awards this quarter, led by precision fires, which booked a $1.1 billion order to supply guided multiple launch rocket systems to the U.S. Army and international customers. MFC also received an order for over $900 million to provide FAD interceptors and equipment to the U.S. Army and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And our Space business area received a fleet ballistic missile order of $600 million for continued Trident II production. Our performance to date and resilient portfolio have positioned us to achieve strong results so far this year. The effects of the COVID-19 outbreak are being felt by our teams, but we remain committed to delivering the vital solutions that our customers require. This pandemic has caused dramatic impacts to our employees and their families, our customers, our supply chain and the communities in which we work and live. Our corporation is committed to use our know-how, resources, leadership to assist during this global crisis. Lockheed Martin is implementing multiple actions to help support affected groups, including accelerating payments of over $150 million to our small and medium-sized supply chain partners, and we have already flowed the first $50 million of an additional $450 million in accelerated payments to our global supply base as a result of the actions taken by the Department of Defense in changing the progress payment policy that I mentioned a moment ago. We have also donated $10 million to nonprofit organizations involved in COVID-19-related relief and assistance with emphasis on veterans and military families. And we have activated a $6.5 million employee disaster relief fund to assist Lockheed Martin employees and retirees impacted by COVID-19. In addition to supporting our global customers through our ongoing contract activity performance, we recognize that providing jobs during this period of economic downturn is also critically important. We are committed to continued hiring during this crisis and have added close to 1,000 new employees over the past few weeks, in addition to advertising for 5,000 open positions. The journey to full recovery will be one which we will all share together. Lockheed Martin is committed to performing with excellence for our stakeholders as we navigate through this crisis in the weeks and months ahead. Moving on, I would like to highlight several significant events that occurred across the corporation during the past quarter, beginning with Aeronautics. We were excited by 2 significant milestones for the F-35 that show the program's continued maturation and ongoing demand. In February, the F-35 team celebrated surpassing 250,000 flight hours for the program, including developmental test jets, training and operational U.S. and international aircraft. The program has now trained more than 1,000 pilots and in excess of 9,000 maintainers as this unrivaled stealth fighter progresses towards full-rate production. In March, the F-35 team delivered the 500th production joint strike fighter aircraft, a conventional takeoff and landing variant for the Air National Guard. Production continues to ramp as we progress towards the joint government and industry plan of record for delivery of more than 3,300 aircraft. Moving to RMS. This quarter, our Sikorsky line of business was down-selected in 2 key rotary wing competitions for the Future Vertical Lift program. The Sikorsky-Boeing team was awarded 1 of 2 future long-range assault aircraft contracts to continue design and risk reduction efforts on the next-generation medium-lift helicopter for U.S. forces. Our SB>1 DEFIANT offering uses our Collier award-winning X2 Technology providing enhanced maneuverability and speed. We look forward to working with our Army customer as we collectively define the next-generation assault aircraft for our warfighter. We were also excited to be down-selected in the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Phase II competition. The Sikorsky RAIDER X rotorcraft uses the same unique technology as the SB DEFIANT -- SB>1 DEFIANT and provides the same speed and maneuverability advantages. Each of these competitions represent long-term growth opportunities, and our Sikorsky organization has been investing for years in pursuit of innovative technologies and designs to fulfill the warfighters objectives. Our Space business area celebrated a pair of milestones this quarter as well as the first 2 GPS-III spacecraft were each separately accepted into operations by the U.S. Air Force Space Command as healthy and active, officially joining the current GPS constellation of 31 satellites. These are the first 2 of 10 modernized GPS-III space vehicles that will be deployed to enhance navigation and positioning capabilities for millions of users. The next-generation GPS-III program will deliver signals 3x more accurate than the current satellites with improved availability, reliability and anti-jamming capabilities for our military users. And we are proud to continue this legacy of innovation for our warfighters. In Missiles and Fire Control, you may recall last quarter, we commented that Missiles and Fire Control have passed an important milestone on the U.S. Army's Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, competition. This quarter, our tactical missiles organization performed its second consecutive successful flight test of this next-generation, long-range precision missile. Our team demonstrated the missile's flight trajectory, range in accuracy and overall missile performance from launch to the conclusion of the mission. We look forward to building on our long-running army tactical missile system legacy in preparation for our third PrSM flight test in the coming weeks as we continue to pursue this potential franchise opportunity. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.\nKenneth Possenriede: Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter. We generated $2.3 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our balanced cash deployment actions, returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders. Our backlog closed just above $144 billion, exceeding our all-time high for the corporation. And we have updated our outlook to include impacts from COVID-19, which we will discuss in greater detail in a moment. Overall, it was still a strong quarter for the business during uncertain and unique times. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 9% compared with last year to $15.7 billion, continuing the consistent growth of the business, while segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. The resulting segment operating margin was a strong 11% ahead of our expectations. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the first quarter of 2020. Our EPS of $6.08 was up $0.09 over our results last year driven by FAS/CAS income and favorable operational performance. On Chart 6, we will discuss in more detail the cash return to our shareholders this quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $2.3 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was greater than $2 billion. We maintained our dividend to $2.40 per share, and we repurchased $756 million worth of shares. This brought our total cash return to shareholders to $1.4 billion for the quarter or 72% of free cash flow. And we see no change to the $1 billion share repurchase outlook for 2020 that we first communicated during our call last October. Chart 7 shows our backlog balance through first quarter of 2020. While delivering our highest first quarter sales ever, we increased our backlog balance for the seventh consecutive quarter driven by bookings at Sikorsky and missile programs at Missiles and Fire Control. Moving on to Chart 8. Based on our view of COVID-19-related potential impacts, as Marillyn noted, we are lowering the midpoint of our guidance range on sales by $375 million while holding our guidance for segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And as we disclosed in the earnings release, our joint venture, AMMROC, in the UAE lost a key contract award after the end of the quarter, and we are still working the assessment of a potential noncash impairment that could be recorded as early as the second quarter once our review is finalized. On Chart 9, we have shown the adjustments to our sales guidance range. Likely COVID-19 impacts on our supply chain and related potential delivery delays have caused us to reduce our full year outlook for Aeronautics. Our expectations for 2020 sales in all other business areas remain consistent with what we discussed in January. On Chart 10, we show our outlook for segment operating profit by business area. While the guidance for profit has been lowered for aeronautics following sales, we have raised our guidance range from Missiles and Fire Control and Space, holding our total segment operating profit consistent -- constant from January's outlook. On Chart 11, we outlined some specific assumptions we are using in our 2020 guidance related to the current impacts of COVID-19. We continue to monitor the situation daily as it remains a dynamic environment. And as Marillyn highlighted, we are proactively taking steps to help support our suppliers and teammates during this difficult time. Our current expectation is that the next few months will be the peak of disruption as the country and the rest of the world looks to successfully flatten the curve move forward. The Department of Defense and the United States government have also taken action to support our industry through policy changes and the CARES Act, and our outlook has taken into consideration these benefits. Together, these actions have allowed us to update the outlook we provided in January with minimal impacts. And to conclude, on Chart 12, we have our summary. We believe that the first quarter of 2020 has laid the foundation for a strong year. We have a robust backlog to sustain our growth. Our sales outlook is growing year-over-year and represents an approximately 6% increase from 2019. Along with consistent profit and positive cash flow, this allows us to project strong results for 2020 for shareholders as we continue to support our employees, customers and supply chain during these difficult times. So before we move to Q&A, I would like to take a moment to congratulate Marillyn on her upcoming transition and thank her for the outstanding leadership she has provided Lockheed Martin over the last 7.5 years. As Chairman, President and CEO, the corporation has reached new heights and delivered remarkable results from our customers and shareholders. Marillyn, during your 37 years with the company, we have all employees, customers, teammates and shareholders benefited from your dedication, inspiration and vision. You and I have worked together for 20 years, and on a personal note, I would like to add that I will also miss your friendship and partnership. Although your presence will certainly be missed on a day-to-day basis, we look forward to continuing to work with you as Executive Chairman of the Board. And I'd also like to welcome Jim Taiclet as our incoming President and CEO, who begins on June 15. I have worked with Jim as a Board member for more than a year while I've been in my current role, and I believe he will be an outstanding leader for our company. And with that, I'd like to wish Marillyn the best of luck, and I look forward to welcoming Jim in June. John, we are ready to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And first, with the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel.\nJoseph DeNardi: Okay. Ken, there's language in the release and you kind of alluded to in your prepared remarks regarding the guidance and kind of reflects your current view on COVID-19. Can you talk about how sensitive the guidance is to duration? Maybe help us a little bit more with kind of what you're assuming for what a return to normalcy looks like. Do you see the effects of this in terms of fixed price contract costs increasing your ability to recover that? Just trying to understand your perspective on how this impacts kind of earnings power and cash flow power longer term.\nKenneth Possenriede: You bet. Thanks, Joe. So it's probably helpful we start with, once this started, what our processes were. Think of this as our battle rhythm. So once this began, we started a weekly COVID-19 impact tracking process. We put together a template, and this was generally across the board, included all the business areas. We had data that we collected that supported various internal and external reporting. In fact, we're now in a rhythm where Marillyn is now sending a memo to the SAEs, think of those as the service acquisition executives. And this is done on a weekly basis. That basically lays out all the impacts that we see, all the actions that we're taking to minimize those impacts. And think of these inputs as at the contract program level, so across the corporation. It's about 600 line items, and it's tracking real and potential Lockheed Martin supplier- and government-driven impacts. The COVID impacts that we're seeing are reflected within this weekly template. And unfortunately, they're predominantly risk-related. Think of them as travel restrictions and site access that are most likely the common cited driver of impact. We're seeing increases in supplier shortages. And in our sites, we're seeing some absenteeism impacts. There are some opportunities that we do see that exist, Joe. From a cash flow standpoint, the customer altered the progress payment rate from 80% to 90%. And also a small nuance but important, they changed some conditions regarding progress payment rates, which will be advantageous to us. And we are now flowing this -- as Marillyn mentioned, we are flowing this all down to our supply base. Starting with our small suppliers and our vulnerable suppliers, we have a process where we work with supply chain. They tell us who those suppliers are. We work with Treasury to determine on a weekly basis the cash flow that we have that we're flowing that down. Contract actions that we're working with our customer, it's accelerated timing of the pending awards, undefinitized contract actions, or UCAs, funding, et cetera. What we're also seeing internally is there -- we're capturing cost avoidance. So think of lack of travel, lack of business trips that we're making, lack of sponsorships, lack of air shows that we're going to. And we're capturing that and collecting that, probably not to take to the bottom line but to help with impact disruptions to our business. You talked about the recovery of costs with the CARES Act. One of the conditions in there is we will work with the PCO and demonstrate to them a request for equitable adjustment that those costs -- those idle costs should be deemed allowable, and we'll work through that. In fact, we have a path forward on the F-35 program to do just that. So we think we're in a good position. The plan is, at least the way we see it, is we're hoping that the curve starts flattening in the second quarter, end of second quarter, and we can get to some kind of semblance of business as usual, whatever that is, starting in the third quarter. You asked about cash, Joe, we feel really good about our cash, and I'll let somebody else -- I'll give some more color on cash for somebody else to ask the question, but we feel really good about our cash flow this year. We started the year strong, ended the first quarter strong, and we see, going forward, strong. So thanks, Joe. Stay safe.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: I guess I'm tempted to ask that cash question, but I'll let somebody else do it. I'll ask what I was going to ask you before. Can you talk about the F-16? I'd like to talk about how that move to Greenville is going for one and how you think about the F-35 in the context of the F-16 sort of a growth versus replacement-type situation, both near and medium and long term.\nKenneth Possenriede: Hunter, we'll give Marillyn a break since it's her last earnings call. So I'll take that. So it's going well. So as everybody is aware, I believe, we moved the F-16 program out of Fort Worth a couple of years ago. Frankly, no home because we didn't have any orders of record and Bahrain was our first customer. We moved the line to Greenville, going very well. Right now, we have Bahrain. You saw we just announced Bulgaria. We have Slovakia. We're in the throes of working with the United States government and Taiwan for them to buy 66 aircraft. There is an African country that is interested in F-16. So we're hopeful that will happen. South American country, and then there are some Southeast Asian countries that are interested in F-16 as well. So we think the program is doing very well. The MOD programs are doing very well. Just in the spirit of COVID, we're not seeing many impacts at all on the F-16 program. So I think this is a good fourth-generation aircraft for those customers that can't afford the F-35 or, frankly, can't at this time buy the F-35. And it might be a good intermediary step for customers to go from the F-16 to F-35. So we see it frankly as complementary and not competing against themselves.\nOperator: The next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein.\nDouglas Harned: First, Marillyn, it's been great working with you over the years. So just wanted to wish you all the best in the transition. I wanted to ask about international sales. And particularly, when you look at the Middle East, I thought it was encouraging that you got this award from Saudi Arabia. But when you look at oil prices where they are today, in the past, we have seen budgets contract when oil prices come down. How are you thinking about the Middle East right now given the oil price environment? And even expand that to say with coronavirus issues in other markets and budgets that may be under pressure, what are you seeing internationally in your export sales?\nMarillyn Hewson: Well, first of all, Doug, thank you for the question. And I would say at the outset that regardless of what's happening with oil prices and other things, the threats continue to accelerate around the world. So we still have that challenge anywhere in the world. I mean it's the first order of any country that they have to protect their citizens. So a lot of the systems we sell into the Middle East are clearly defensive systems. And more than ever, that's more complex, volatile and unpredictable than it's ever been before. So that's a necessary condition that they have that national security, and I expect that will continue. We will continue on our side to drive affordability across all of our product lines to make sure that what we do offer is the best value to those countries and -- but we aren't seeing a pullback from the needs that they have today in the Middle East.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Marillyn, you've had an amazing career, and it's apparent in Lockheed success in both the top line and operations. I guess as you exit on top, how do you think about the challenges for Jim in areas you would have liked to spend more time with on Lockheed and position better for the next 5 years? How does Lockheed continue to grow over the next decade?\nMarillyn Hewson: Well, thank you, Sheila, for your kind comments. I would first start by saying that I think this is the right time for a transition in our company because our company is very strong and stable. We've got solid performance. We've got a very strong robust growth strategy, even again this year continuing to grow. We finished out last year with a record year, and we've had a series of a very strong record for the past few years. And we're set up well with a $144 billion backlog, which I think outlines -- that's the booked work that we have and a strong financial position. I think as Jim steps into the role -- he's been on our Board for over 2 years, as Ken said, and he has a military background. He's worked in the industry, in Pratt & Whitney and Honeywell. He's got a lot of strong experience around our industry, our markets, our business. And so he brings that, plus the insights he's gained on our Board for the last couple of years in our strategy, our long-range plan. So I think you will see that he will continue to drive the success that we've had over the last few years. He fits very well into our culture, and we're really looking forward to -- he brings a strong acumen -- business acumen because, of course, he's himself been a CEO for the past 17 years. In terms of priorities, we will continue to strengthen our focus on our customer. That has what's driven the success of this business is aligning with their priorities and listening to them and understanding what they need and then driving sustained profitable growth around that and delivering them the performance that they expect because they do depend on us. As we said earlier, we're an essential industry sector, and that is clearly because of the national security products and capabilities we produce. And so we know that performance and innovation for our customers has got to be continued. And then lastly, I would just say, keeping a focus on the people in this company. We have a strong culture of -- an innovative culture of people that make the difference. And I know that as Jim comes in with his style of a value-based leader as he is and a collaborative leader that he will continue that forward. So I think you could -- that you can just look at us as being very well positioned for the future as we -- as I turn over the reins to Jim in mid-June.\nOperator: And our next question is from Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global Advisors.\nPeter Skibitski: Congratulations, Marillyn, on a great career. On the COVID-related sales reduction in Aerospace, I just want to make sure I understand. Was the guidance lowered there due to the international F-35 sites, Italy and Japan sites? And why were the other segments not impacted?\nKenneth Possenriede: Sure. Pete, it's Ken. I'll take that. So let's talk Aeronautics, and then I'll go around the other business areas. So Aeronautics, we looked at -- we started seeing that it is likely there is going to be -- and I'd say it's probable that there's going to be some supply chain disruption. What we're seeing is there's local distancing requirements that are being more stringently applied across the globe. There's workforce disruption. There are likely impacts that are happening throughout their supply tier hierarchy. There are shipping constraints. We've actually had some issues with shipping constraints. We're also finding there's likely going to be some production impacts at our site. And based on that, the analysis to date had given us concern. So we reduced our guidance at Aeronautics. And specifically, it's F-35 production. There's more analysis that we're going to do over the next couple of weeks working with our supply chain and our Fort Worth production line and our customers to set -- to determine, if any, impact, to what extent it will be on the program, including deliveries. In fact, last night, I got some feedback from the supply chain team, and this is specific to F-35 and specific to production. We're seeing some pressure regarding supplier performance-based payment invoices. So this is -- these are invoices that they could deliver to us after they completed a milestone. There are a couple of suppliers that are going to be delinquent in April. Some of them are for administrative reasons. We'll work through that. So that's just timing. But some of them -- and some are domestic, U.S.-based, and some of them are international, that it is due to them not achieving their milestones. Some of it is going to be COVID-related, probably most of it is COVID-related. We're looking at that. So we then did an analysis, a bunch of sensitivity analysis with the Aeronautics team. And if you look at F-35, we're seeing little to no impact to development. We're able to continue to work on follow-on modernization. That is what typically is happening on the development program. Sustainment, generally speaking, the team does not see any impact. And if they do see impact, back to Joe's question about the recoverability of the costs, we feel comfortable due to the CARES Act. If we have somebody who can't get on base to do, say, a repair, if you will, or to stand up a base and they're sent home and they're not able to do productive work at home, we are believing those costs are recoverable. And so it's all down to production. We have seen in the past some impacts at the Japanese FACO, they're up and running now; and at the Italian FACO, but on the whole, they're up and running as well. So it was our determination based on what we're seeing that it was prudent for us to take our production sales down. Hopefully, this is a conservative number, but based on what we're seeing, we think this is a good number. You asked about the other business areas and why we're not seeing impacts there right now. So I'll start with Space. So think of their production cycle, it's a long production cycle. And generally speaking, what -- any issues that they would see in the supply chain or at our facilities, they feel they could contain. So it's low volume, certainly, relative to F-35 production line. They have an engineering workforce. They were one of the first ones to be -- they were the first ones, frankly, in our company to be impacted by this. They're now staggering their shifts. They're staggering the days that people come into the office. It is impacting some of their classified programs, but we seem to be doing a nice job working around that. So we feel good with their guidance right now. RMS, they don't have the volume. So talk -- the manufacturing floor, they don't have the volume of Fort Worth. Think of their volume more like Marietta. And I did -- I was remiss not to talk about Marietta. So there are some suppliers where we are impacted that we are doing workarounds and we do think we have a containment plan. So we do see some modest impact at Marietta, but it's not material. So I would state that RMS is more like Marietta. So there are some issues there, but they're not material in nature. Their engineering team, so the folks that are doing engineering work at RMS, are still productive. There are some base and range closures that are impacting RMS, but we seem to have workarounds and so we don't see any impact there. The next concern we would have is at Missiles and Fire Control. And it's just based on the -- it's a high-volume business. They have done a nice job of looking through their supply chain. They have made contact with 100% of their suppliers. And before -- last week, I would have told you, 6% are forecasting impacts. In Maryland staff meeting, we found out yesterday, it's up to 10%. So they actually have a very robust process of talking through their supply base. They had 2 suppliers that had closed operations. One of them we're still working through and working through second sources and also containment plans for them. And another one had an operation in Mexico. We worked through that and got that one open. So we feel good right now where Missiles and Fire Control as well -- where they are as well from a guidance standpoint. But that would be our next worry bead would be Missiles and Fire Control. So net-net, we're good with guidance at the other 3. We think we've thought through the Aeronautics one -- Aeronautics issues, and we feel good about that. And just -- we've looked across the portfolio, and not just COVID-related risk, but we've looked at, call it, business as usual opportunity and risk, and we think we've box-balanced everything, and we feel good about our guidance as it stands today.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to David Strauss with Barclays.\nDavid Strauss: Congrats and well done, Marillyn. I'll take the bait, Ken, on cash. I think you were talking about a little bit more than a $700 million working capital headwind or increase this year. How are you thinking about that now on the back of COVID-19? And maybe comment on Q1, you saw a big increase in your payables balance.\nKenneth Possenriede: You bet. Thanks, David. So yes, we -- like I said, we feel good about cash flow this year. And I'll say it again. If it wasn't for COVID-19, we were very comfortable with taking our cash from operations up -- our cash from operations number of greater than $7.6 billion. So yes, going into the first quarter, we did increase payables. We did pay down payables in the fourth quarter. Part of the reason why Aeronautics and a couple other business areas did so well was, frankly, we got invoices -- from a timing standpoint, we got invoices in -- late in the quarter that ended up being payables, so we had abnormally high payables that also then flowed into inventory or into contract assets, which we do think is an opportunity going forward for us. So even with the COVID impacts, we do see, over time, working capital increases, specifically in contract assets, most of them in F-35, and we're working with the F-35. We think there's an opportunity there for us to reduce our contract assets. The other thing I would state is -- why we had the high payables in the first quarter is these COVID actions that Marillyn described of us flowing money down to the supply chain really didn't start happening for the most part until we got into the second quarter. So we'll continue to flow down that committed $450 million that we got certainly through the second quarter, but David, it's likely we're going to flow that down in the third and fourth quarter as well, and we will probably take our -- what I'll call our normal payables number down in the fourth quarter and accelerate payments to the small business base and our vulnerable suppliers.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research.\nRobert Stallard: Marillyn, all the best for the future, but I have a final question for you. And it's a little bit tricky. I was wondering what's your gauge of the political environment at the moment, whether it's, what you might say, politically acceptable for the companies to be buying back stock given the crisis the country is going through.\nMarillyn Hewson: Well, thank you for your comments, Rob, and thanks for the question. The political environment today, I know, is very difficult, particularly for companies that basically have no demand. And when everything shut down -- and I'm very pleased to be part of the conversation on the President's task force and on some other task forces our company is so that we can work with governors and the President on looking at how best to get the economy back to work in a very safe and effective way. As you know, as we've talked about, we've been running all through this time. And so we're in a position where it's a matter of sharing how we're keeping our people safe, how we're keeping our operations running, we're dealing with supply chain, a lot of the things that Ken spoke of here. In terms of the political environment, where there are -- I think what you're referencing is where companies are going to get some kind of support from the CARES Act and other ways to help their business, and then as a result of that, would it be appropriate for them to destock buybacks. And I think you've heard all of them, at least all that I've heard, go publicly say, no, that's not their intention. They really need that funding today in order to address their business need, to address their cash needs, to address getting their folks back to work because, basically, their demand went to 0. I think it's very different than a normal company like -- that sets out the year with a plan on cash deployment, which would be through dividends, through stock buybacks, through capital investment, through the range of things that we all do with cash, and we -- in our case, we haven't changed our process at all. I mean we made a commitment in October that we were going to do about $1 billion in stock repurchases, and that's -- that we still are holding to that for this year. And so we're very different, I think, than those who have experienced a very significant impact to their demand. Ken, I don't know if you want to add anything on that front relative to our situation on...\nKenneth Possenriede: You bet. Yes. So Rob, I'll give you just a little color of what we've done actually. So late last year, we entered into a 10b5-1, and think of that as an enhanced open market repurchase program. So we essentially went to the banks late last year and said, we want to buy $500 million to $600 million of stock back starting in January through July. So we're in this 10b5-1 through July. And in the first quarter, of that, we bought $256 million back of the $756 million that you heard me state we bought back in the first quarter. Early in the year, we thought it would be advantageous just to go on autopilot, if you will, and we signed up. This would be our second one, we did one in the fourth quarter of last year, an accelerated share repurchase program. And as you know, when you commit to that, you put the money upfront, gives the bank then the discretion to buy it back when they want to buy it back. So we fronted that money, if you will, in the first quarter. And that plan goes through the end of April. So think of that in 9 days, that program is over. So that's why you saw the amount we bought back was earmarked $756 million of repos in the quarter. As I stated, we reaffirmed -- and Marillyn just foot stomped that, we reaffirmed our $1 billion commitment, which basically will be on autopilot that will go through July. So think of us buying back another $244 million over the next couple -- next 2 months to get us to the $1 billion. And what we have done in the past, just frankly over the last couple of years, we've done this just to prevent dilution of our share count, and that's what we're committed on now. If we get out of this COVID situation, we may look at this again and readdress it and see if it makes sense to opportunistically buy our stock back if we think that makes sense. But in the meantime, while COVID is going on, our commitment is we're going to maximize our balance sheet to generate cash flow, and we're going to send as much down as we can -- and as much as we can down to our distressed vulnerable supply base and our small supply base. While we're on capital deployment, I'll talk about dividends. It is from a planning standpoint. Our plan, subject to the Board's approval, for us still to declare and pay dividends. So that's in our modeling for the rest of the year. And I'll just remind you, we're still spending, investing in our business roughly $1.3 billion in IRAD for this year. And as I stated earlier, we're still on a path from a CapEx standpoint to spend roughly $1.7 billion on CapEx. So we're not skirting our responsibilities to our supply chain nor to the investments we believe we need to make for us to be a vibrant business going forward.\nOperator: Next question is from Peter Arment with Baird.\nPeter Arment: Marillyn, congratulations on all your success. Ken, maybe just a backlog question. You have stable backlog, and I think the expectation was for 2020, you'd see growth of $3 billion to $4 billion, whether that -- is that still intact? And is there any kind of international awards that are key that we should be looking at that will impact that?\nKenneth Possenriede: Yes. Thanks, Peter. Yes, the plan is we still think we're going to grow our backlog. I mentioned earlier for one of the questions, we're working with the -- I'll talk United States first, the United States customer. We're working with them where it makes sense for us to accelerate orders to get that into our backlog, to get that behind us. You already saw F-35 Lot 14 was in the second quarter. We got that order behind us. And that does actually have some international customers. Think of 35%, 40% of those airplanes will be going to international customers. But there are a bunch of international orders, and I'll go through them, that we generally feel pretty good about. So Bulgaria is behind us for F-16. We got those 8 aircraft behind us. We're working with Indonesia on some C-130 aircraft. We feel good about that. Working with India, you probably saw the announcement that the money is flowing from India to the United States. So we'll now work with the appropriate government agencies to get that under contract. That's for the MH-60R multi-role helicopter program. We have a Spain F-110 frigate program we feel good about. F-16, Taiwan, I mentioned, that's a third quarter order. We still feel good about that. We also have a couple of orders for F-16 that we're working to try to shape. There's a Norway contract out in the fourth quarter. So I'd say on the whole, we're feeling good about our order book. And in fact, because of some accelerations, we actually think we'll overachieve our orders planned this year by over $3 billion. And that's mainly driven by PAC-3, that's FY '21, where I think we're in a good spot with the customer to accelerate those orders.\nOperator: Next question is from Carter Copeland with Melius Research.\nCarter Copeland: Again, congratulations on all the accomplishments and the retirement. It's been quite impressive. So just want to kind of follow up a little bit on the award environment. And I think a little bit longer term, you hinted at it, Marillyn, on the plus ups and areas of emphasis and things that are in the NDS. And I just wondered if you might give us some color on how you see that influencing the opportunity pipeline that you've been talking about over the last several quarters, not just in hypersonics but also at MDA. And just anywhere you think that, that's unfolding in a way that's different as a result of the budget request.\nMarillyn Hewson: Thanks for the question. Thanks for the comment, too, Carter. I appreciate it. Well, as I talked in my opening remarks about the FY '21 budget -- President's budget request that came out, and while the top line budget is not growing significantly, there's a little bit -- some slight growth, and so we're looking -- as we look at it. But Congress really is yet to weigh in on what's in that budget for our programs. Right now, they're well supported. But we -- often, Congress looks in and determines whether they want to do some ads and in certain areas as well. So for example, last year, they added 20 planes for the F-35. And we've seen some other areas of support from Congress over the years. So we feel good about what's in the budget request right now. As I mentioned, it does line up with the national defense strategy. And that's exactly the areas that are lined up with our particular portfolio. There's -- the budget submission has over $3 billion in it for hypersonics, which is we've shown that we are a strong leader in that. We continue to see as we look beyond that, there's also some upside for NASA, for Orion and for some of the Mars missions. I think there's over $3 billion that was put in increase for that. And then we continue to look at not only continued growth through the U.S. budget side but also on the international side. Now these would be FMS sales, but F-35, as you know, Poland has committed to 32 aircraft. We see opportunities with Finland, with Switzerland, with Spain potentially and other countries, we think, that are starting to show interest -- continued interest in the F-35 as a potential to meet their fighter replacement needs. And then on the missile defense arena, THAAD, PAC-3, Aegis, all continue to be growth opportunities for us. If you look on around to the Sikorsky side of the business, I mentioned the Future Vertical Lift. That's a big upside for us as potential as we see opportunities for growth there. CH-53K that we do for the Marine Corps with a 200-aircraft program of record. There's also strong interest in Germany and in Israel. And then in our Space business, we continue to see upside there in a lot of the space protection and a lot of the mission areas there for the national security space opportunities for growth. So I feel really good about our growth opportunities as we look out even beyond this year and into the future. Space side, the next-gen OPIR and GPS are other contract opportunities that we continue to see growth. So as Ken said, we expect our backlog to grow. We expect to continue to win at a good rate on these opportunities because we have a strong portfolio. We've been investing for many years in things like hypersonics and other areas of our business that set us up well for robust growth.\nKenneth Possenriede: John, I think we have time for one more question.\nOperator: And that will be from Ron Epstein with Bank of America Securities.\nRonald Epstein: Marillyn, if you could speak to when you think about the impact that COVID's having on some of your international customers, meaning you've got F-35s potentially going different places in the world. And how do we think about the impact that, that could have on those deliveries of aircraft?\nMarillyn Hewson: Well, on the international front, I think Ken talked a little bit about the fact that we have a couple of final assembly and checkout facilities on the international scene, so in Italy and in Japan. And early on, they did have some impact where they shut down for a few days or for a week, but they're back running again. We have suppliers around the world that support our F-35 program and other programs. So we watch how those suppliers are working in their various countries with whatever constraints they might have or safety protocols that are put in place. And so that's -- as Ken said, we do a very deep dive on our supply base on a weekly basis to make sure we're monitoring that, and we're addressing that. So that could potentially have some disruption for us. Similarly, we -- transportation is an area that we've been watching to make sure that we've got good transformation of the parts and components coming in. But I think in terms of countries, it goes back to my earlier comment. Countries are still -- need to address their national security needs. So I'm not looking at it so much from an impact on what they will buy because they are staying on their procurement plans, and despite the fact that things like COVID-19 will have some impact on their economic situation just as it has in the U.S. I think it's more really around the international supply chain that we're going to keep a bead on that to make sure that those suppliers around the world continue to operate. We -- as we talk about cash deployment to our suppliers, we are getting to those international suppliers as well because they're part of our supply chain. And so to the extent that we have an opportunity to flow through and accelerate payments, we accelerate them to them as well as to our domestic suppliers in the U.S. That will continue to be the area for us. We -- they may face challenges of productivity or absenteeism and/or other constraints, and so we'll continue to watch that closely. And frankly, that's the area that we watch the most closely and why we've been so focused on it every week. Okay. So I guess that's our last question. So let me just conclude the call today. And before I do, I know several of you, starting with Ken, know that this is my last call as President and CEO. And I appreciate your kind remarks, and I appreciate, Ken, what you said as my colleague and friend for so many years, and I appreciate your comments. But I really wanted to take this time at the end of the call just to thank the entire Lockheed Martin family for the support and dedication that they've given as the company has grown and flourished over my now 7.5 years as CEO and, moreover, over 37 years with this company. We are a very strong corporation, and we've got a legacy of innovation and performance and a future of promise and growth. And when I think back 37 years ago when I first started as an industrial engineer supporting the production line in Marietta, Georgia, I'm reminded of a lot of hardworking and dedicated people that I worked with over my career, including the people that I work with today, the current employees that are making a difference every day in the work that we do because we do some of the most important work in the world. So it's been an honor for me to be a part of this team and this company. I've often said, I consider Lockheed Martin a national asset because we perform an important mission and support of our nation's defense and its citizens and also our allies around the world. I also want to thank you, our investment community and our shareholders, for your participation in these calls and also for your thoughtful engagement that you've provided with our management team over the years. It's helped us as we understand what's important to you and how you look at our business and the questions that you ask. And I said earlier, I know that you will welcome Jim Taiclet to our team. I'm certain that he's going to lead the company to continued success. He has a tremendous track record of achievement that's outstanding, and he's -- as I said earlier, he joins a company with a culture of performing with excellence for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. So I assure you that Lockheed Martin will be in very good hands with Jim at the helm. So thank you again for joining us on the call today. Our team looks forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. John, that concludes our call today.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Marillyn Hewson",
            "content": "Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope this call finds you and your family safe and healthy as we collectively work to address the many issues brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. Our nation and the global community have seen the dramatic effects of the COVID-19 crisis. We are all saddened by the rise in illness and the tragic loss of life that has resulted from it, and our Lockheed Martin family has not been spared from this pandemic. The world continues to battle this disease, with experts predicting improvements will be seen in the coming weeks and months. And while this is certainly encouraging, we must remain vigilant to ensure progress is achieved. The corporation is taking necessary steps to help combat this virus and keep our employees safe while assuring our customers can achieve their important readiness and mission requirements. We are beginning to experience some issues in each of our business areas related to the coronavirus, primarily in access to some locations and delays of supplier deliveries, which have caused us to adjust our full year sales outlook, and we will discuss that later in the call. Our teams are successfully addressing many of the risks that have arisen due to the COVID-19 impacts. Our manufacturing facilities are open, and our workforce is engaged. The situation will evolve, and we will continue to monitor our business environment for areas of concern. The corporation remains committed to delivering the products and services needed for our customers and to maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for our employees. In recognition of this unprecedented situation, the U.S. government has taken several actions that continue to reinforce the importance of our nation's defense industry. The Department of Homeland Security deems the defense industrial base to be part of the nation's essential critical infrastructure. And the Department of Defense has issued guidance that confirms the expectation that companies providing products and services in support of national security continue to maintain staffing and work schedules to perform their crucial functions. The DoD also published a deviation on progress payments memo, issuing a blanket increase to progress payment rates for both large and small businesses. Stable and reliable cash inflows provide needed visibility for all businesses and will be especially important to many small and medium-sized suppliers. These actions underscore the country's commitment to our industry and importantly, to our supply chain, which provides tremendous innovation and strength to our national security products. The international community is also deeply affected by this crisis. And our company is committed to perform with excellence for our global customers and to support the health and well-being of our employees around the world. The corporation is taking steps to aid our employees, teammates and others. And in a few moments, I will discuss some of the actions we have taken to help provide support to those affected by this crisis. I will touch briefly now on the Department of Defense budgets and the recent presidential budget submission. This quarter, the President submitted the fiscal year 2021 budget recommendation to Congress, consistent with the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 enacted values, with the total national defense request equaling approximately $741 billion. Notably, the DoD reiterated their commitment to the national defense strategy and their submission, with the space domain, air and missile defense and hypersonic programs, key pillars in their strategy and our portfolio, all receiving increases from the previous submissions. Congress will continue to process with the authorization and appropriations phases. Our programs remain well supported, and our portfolio is broad and expanding. We look forward to the finalization of the process and supporting our warfighters' needs. Ken will review our first quarter financials and updated full year outlook in more detail in a few minutes. I would like to begin by noting that the disruptions introduced by this virus have caused us to reduce our 2020 sales expectation as production and supply chain activities have recently slowed in our Aeronautics business area. The changes in our outlook represent impacts we anticipate being recognized over the remainder of the year. We are not projecting any changes due to our expected full year operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations outlooks that we set forth in January. Our results this quarter were very strong. Sales in the quarter exceeded last year's first quarter by more than 9%, led by our Aeronautics team as the Aeronautics business area grew 14% from the first quarter of 2019. Our segment profit came in just above the first quarter 2019 amount as risk retirements in all business areas allowed us to exceed our expectations in this quarter. And we had a strong quarter of cash generation, bringing in over $2.3 billion of cash from operations as we look to achieve our full year target of greater than or equal to $7.6 billion. Moving to orders and backlog. We received more than $15 billion in orders this quarter, maintaining our backlog at approximately $144 billion, our all-time high. RMS garnered the largest set of awards, with the total exceeding $7 billion, led by our Sikorsky organization, which booked over $4 billion of orders, including over $2 billion for a performance-based logistics contract for the U.S. Navy to provide sustainment services on our MH-60 SEAHAWK platform; and award of $500 million for the second low-rate initial production, or LRIP, contract for 12 combat rescue helicopters; and $470 million awards -- award for LRIP 2 of the presidential helicopter contract, adding 6 aircraft to the program and bringing the total order to 12 rotary aircraft out of a total program of record of 23 aircraft. Aeronautics also had a strong quarter, with aggregate F-35 orders approaching $900 million. Other awards, including a new classified order, brought the Aeronautics business area total to $3.6 billion for the quarter. Missiles and Fire Control received a pair of sizable awards this quarter, led by precision fires, which booked a $1.1 billion order to supply guided multiple launch rocket systems to the U.S. Army and international customers. MFC also received an order for over $900 million to provide FAD interceptors and equipment to the U.S. Army and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. And our Space business area received a fleet ballistic missile order of $600 million for continued Trident II production. Our performance to date and resilient portfolio have positioned us to achieve strong results so far this year. The effects of the COVID-19 outbreak are being felt by our teams, but we remain committed to delivering the vital solutions that our customers require. This pandemic has caused dramatic impacts to our employees and their families, our customers, our supply chain and the communities in which we work and live. Our corporation is committed to use our know-how, resources, leadership to assist during this global crisis. Lockheed Martin is implementing multiple actions to help support affected groups, including accelerating payments of over $150 million to our small and medium-sized supply chain partners, and we have already flowed the first $50 million of an additional $450 million in accelerated payments to our global supply base as a result of the actions taken by the Department of Defense in changing the progress payment policy that I mentioned a moment ago. We have also donated $10 million to nonprofit organizations involved in COVID-19-related relief and assistance with emphasis on veterans and military families. And we have activated a $6.5 million employee disaster relief fund to assist Lockheed Martin employees and retirees impacted by COVID-19. In addition to supporting our global customers through our ongoing contract activity performance, we recognize that providing jobs during this period of economic downturn is also critically important. We are committed to continued hiring during this crisis and have added close to 1,000 new employees over the past few weeks, in addition to advertising for 5,000 open positions. The journey to full recovery will be one which we will all share together. Lockheed Martin is committed to performing with excellence for our stakeholders as we navigate through this crisis in the weeks and months ahead. Moving on, I would like to highlight several significant events that occurred across the corporation during the past quarter, beginning with Aeronautics. We were excited by 2 significant milestones for the F-35 that show the program's continued maturation and ongoing demand. In February, the F-35 team celebrated surpassing 250,000 flight hours for the program, including developmental test jets, training and operational U.S. and international aircraft. The program has now trained more than 1,000 pilots and in excess of 9,000 maintainers as this unrivaled stealth fighter progresses towards full-rate production. In March, the F-35 team delivered the 500th production joint strike fighter aircraft, a conventional takeoff and landing variant for the Air National Guard. Production continues to ramp as we progress towards the joint government and industry plan of record for delivery of more than 3,300 aircraft. Moving to RMS. This quarter, our Sikorsky line of business was down-selected in 2 key rotary wing competitions for the Future Vertical Lift program. The Sikorsky-Boeing team was awarded 1 of 2 future long-range assault aircraft contracts to continue design and risk reduction efforts on the next-generation medium-lift helicopter for U.S. forces. Our SB>1 DEFIANT offering uses our Collier award-winning X2 Technology providing enhanced maneuverability and speed. We look forward to working with our Army customer as we collectively define the next-generation assault aircraft for our warfighter. We were also excited to be down-selected in the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft Phase II competition. The Sikorsky RAIDER X rotorcraft uses the same unique technology as the SB DEFIANT -- SB>1 DEFIANT and provides the same speed and maneuverability advantages. Each of these competitions represent long-term growth opportunities, and our Sikorsky organization has been investing for years in pursuit of innovative technologies and designs to fulfill the warfighters objectives. Our Space business area celebrated a pair of milestones this quarter as well as the first 2 GPS-III spacecraft were each separately accepted into operations by the U.S. Air Force Space Command as healthy and active, officially joining the current GPS constellation of 31 satellites. These are the first 2 of 10 modernized GPS-III space vehicles that will be deployed to enhance navigation and positioning capabilities for millions of users. The next-generation GPS-III program will deliver signals 3x more accurate than the current satellites with improved availability, reliability and anti-jamming capabilities for our military users. And we are proud to continue this legacy of innovation for our warfighters. In Missiles and Fire Control, you may recall last quarter, we commented that Missiles and Fire Control have passed an important milestone on the U.S. Army's Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, competition. This quarter, our tactical missiles organization performed its second consecutive successful flight test of this next-generation, long-range precision missile. Our team demonstrated the missile's flight trajectory, range in accuracy and overall missile performance from launch to the conclusion of the mission. We look forward to building on our long-running army tactical missile system legacy in preparation for our third PrSM flight test in the coming weeks as we continue to pursue this potential franchise opportunity. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Well, first of all, Doug, thank you for the question. And I would say at the outset that regardless of what's happening with oil prices and other things, the threats continue to accelerate around the world. So we still have that challenge anywhere in the world. I mean it's the first order of any country that they have to protect their citizens. So a lot of the systems we sell into the Middle East are clearly defensive systems. And more than ever, that's more complex, volatile and unpredictable than it's ever been before. So that's a necessary condition that they have that national security, and I expect that will continue. We will continue on our side to drive affordability across all of our product lines to make sure that what we do offer is the best value to those countries and -- but we aren't seeing a pullback from the needs that they have today in the Middle East. Well, thank you, Sheila, for your kind comments. I would first start by saying that I think this is the right time for a transition in our company because our company is very strong and stable. We've got solid performance. We've got a very strong robust growth strategy, even again this year continuing to grow. We finished out last year with a record year, and we've had a series of a very strong record for the past few years. And we're set up well with a $144 billion backlog, which I think outlines -- that's the booked work that we have and a strong financial position. I think as Jim steps into the role -- he's been on our Board for over 2 years, as Ken said, and he has a military background. He's worked in the industry, in Pratt & Whitney and Honeywell. He's got a lot of strong experience around our industry, our markets, our business. And so he brings that, plus the insights he's gained on our Board for the last couple of years in our strategy, our long-range plan. So I think you will see that he will continue to drive the success that we've had over the last few years. He fits very well into our culture, and we're really looking forward to -- he brings a strong acumen -- business acumen because, of course, he's himself been a CEO for the past 17 years. In terms of priorities, we will continue to strengthen our focus on our customer. That has what's driven the success of this business is aligning with their priorities and listening to them and understanding what they need and then driving sustained profitable growth around that and delivering them the performance that they expect because they do depend on us. As we said earlier, we're an essential industry sector, and that is clearly because of the national security products and capabilities we produce. And so we know that performance and innovation for our customers has got to be continued. And then lastly, I would just say, keeping a focus on the people in this company. We have a strong culture of -- an innovative culture of people that make the difference. And I know that as Jim comes in with his style of a value-based leader as he is and a collaborative leader that he will continue that forward. So I think you could -- that you can just look at us as being very well positioned for the future as we -- as I turn over the reins to Jim in mid-June. Well, thank you for your comments, Rob, and thanks for the question. The political environment today, I know, is very difficult, particularly for companies that basically have no demand. And when everything shut down -- and I'm very pleased to be part of the conversation on the President's task force and on some other task forces our company is so that we can work with governors and the President on looking at how best to get the economy back to work in a very safe and effective way. As you know, as we've talked about, we've been running all through this time. And so we're in a position where it's a matter of sharing how we're keeping our people safe, how we're keeping our operations running, we're dealing with supply chain, a lot of the things that Ken spoke of here. In terms of the political environment, where there are -- I think what you're referencing is where companies are going to get some kind of support from the CARES Act and other ways to help their business, and then as a result of that, would it be appropriate for them to destock buybacks. And I think you've heard all of them, at least all that I've heard, go publicly say, no, that's not their intention. They really need that funding today in order to address their business need, to address their cash needs, to address getting their folks back to work because, basically, their demand went to 0. I think it's very different than a normal company like -- that sets out the year with a plan on cash deployment, which would be through dividends, through stock buybacks, through capital investment, through the range of things that we all do with cash, and we -- in our case, we haven't changed our process at all. I mean we made a commitment in October that we were going to do about $1 billion in stock repurchases, and that's -- that we still are holding to that for this year. And so we're very different, I think, than those who have experienced a very significant impact to their demand. Ken, I don't know if you want to add anything on that front relative to our situation on... Thanks for the question. Thanks for the comment, too, Carter. I appreciate it. Well, as I talked in my opening remarks about the FY '21 budget -- President's budget request that came out, and while the top line budget is not growing significantly, there's a little bit -- some slight growth, and so we're looking -- as we look at it. But Congress really is yet to weigh in on what's in that budget for our programs. Right now, they're well supported. But we -- often, Congress looks in and determines whether they want to do some ads and in certain areas as well. So for example, last year, they added 20 planes for the F-35. And we've seen some other areas of support from Congress over the years. So we feel good about what's in the budget request right now. As I mentioned, it does line up with the national defense strategy. And that's exactly the areas that are lined up with our particular portfolio. There's -- the budget submission has over $3 billion in it for hypersonics, which is we've shown that we are a strong leader in that. We continue to see as we look beyond that, there's also some upside for NASA, for Orion and for some of the Mars missions. I think there's over $3 billion that was put in increase for that. And then we continue to look at not only continued growth through the U.S. budget side but also on the international side. Now these would be FMS sales, but F-35, as you know, Poland has committed to 32 aircraft. We see opportunities with Finland, with Switzerland, with Spain potentially and other countries, we think, that are starting to show interest -- continued interest in the F-35 as a potential to meet their fighter replacement needs. And then on the missile defense arena, THAAD, PAC-3, Aegis, all continue to be growth opportunities for us. If you look on around to the Sikorsky side of the business, I mentioned the Future Vertical Lift. That's a big upside for us as potential as we see opportunities for growth there. CH-53K that we do for the Marine Corps with a 200-aircraft program of record. There's also strong interest in Germany and in Israel. And then in our Space business, we continue to see upside there in a lot of the space protection and a lot of the mission areas there for the national security space opportunities for growth. So I feel really good about our growth opportunities as we look out even beyond this year and into the future. Space side, the next-gen OPIR and GPS are other contract opportunities that we continue to see growth. So as Ken said, we expect our backlog to grow. We expect to continue to win at a good rate on these opportunities because we have a strong portfolio. We've been investing for many years in things like hypersonics and other areas of our business that set us up well for robust growth. Well, on the international front, I think Ken talked a little bit about the fact that we have a couple of final assembly and checkout facilities on the international scene, so in Italy and in Japan. And early on, they did have some impact where they shut down for a few days or for a week, but they're back running again. We have suppliers around the world that support our F-35 program and other programs. So we watch how those suppliers are working in their various countries with whatever constraints they might have or safety protocols that are put in place. And so that's -- as Ken said, we do a very deep dive on our supply base on a weekly basis to make sure we're monitoring that, and we're addressing that. So that could potentially have some disruption for us. Similarly, we -- transportation is an area that we've been watching to make sure that we've got good transformation of the parts and components coming in. But I think in terms of countries, it goes back to my earlier comment. Countries are still -- need to address their national security needs. So I'm not looking at it so much from an impact on what they will buy because they are staying on their procurement plans, and despite the fact that things like COVID-19 will have some impact on their economic situation just as it has in the U.S. I think it's more really around the international supply chain that we're going to keep a bead on that to make sure that those suppliers around the world continue to operate. We -- as we talk about cash deployment to our suppliers, we are getting to those international suppliers as well because they're part of our supply chain. And so to the extent that we have an opportunity to flow through and accelerate payments, we accelerate them to them as well as to our domestic suppliers in the U.S. That will continue to be the area for us. We -- they may face challenges of productivity or absenteeism and/or other constraints, and so we'll continue to watch that closely. And frankly, that's the area that we watch the most closely and why we've been so focused on it every week. Okay. So I guess that's our last question. So let me just conclude the call today. And before I do, I know several of you, starting with Ken, know that this is my last call as President and CEO. And I appreciate your kind remarks, and I appreciate, Ken, what you said as my colleague and friend for so many years, and I appreciate your comments. But I really wanted to take this time at the end of the call just to thank the entire Lockheed Martin family for the support and dedication that they've given as the company has grown and flourished over my now 7.5 years as CEO and, moreover, over 37 years with this company. We are a very strong corporation, and we've got a legacy of innovation and performance and a future of promise and growth. And when I think back 37 years ago when I first started as an industrial engineer supporting the production line in Marietta, Georgia, I'm reminded of a lot of hardworking and dedicated people that I worked with over my career, including the people that I work with today, the current employees that are making a difference every day in the work that we do because we do some of the most important work in the world. So it's been an honor for me to be a part of this team and this company. I've often said, I consider Lockheed Martin a national asset because we perform an important mission and support of our nation's defense and its citizens and also our allies around the world. I also want to thank you, our investment community and our shareholders, for your participation in these calls and also for your thoughtful engagement that you've provided with our management team over the years. It's helped us as we understand what's important to you and how you look at our business and the questions that you ask. And I said earlier, I know that you will welcome Jim Taiclet to our team. I'm certain that he's going to lead the company to continued success. He has a tremendous track record of achievement that's outstanding, and he's -- as I said earlier, he joins a company with a culture of performing with excellence for our customers, our employees and our shareholders. So I assure you that Lockheed Martin will be in very good hands with Jim at the helm. So thank you again for joining us on the call today. Our team looks forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. John, that concludes our call today."

            "name": "Kenneth Possenriede",
            "content": "Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter. We generated $2.3 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our balanced cash deployment actions, returning $1.4 billion to our shareholders. Our backlog closed just above $144 billion, exceeding our all-time high for the corporation. And we have updated our outlook to include impacts from COVID-19, which we will discuss in greater detail in a moment. Overall, it was still a strong quarter for the business during uncertain and unique times. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 9% compared with last year to $15.7 billion, continuing the consistent growth of the business, while segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. The resulting segment operating margin was a strong 11% ahead of our expectations. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the first quarter of 2020. Our EPS of $6.08 was up $0.09 over our results last year driven by FAS/CAS income and favorable operational performance. On Chart 6, we will discuss in more detail the cash return to our shareholders this quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $2.3 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was greater than $2 billion. We maintained our dividend to $2.40 per share, and we repurchased $756 million worth of shares. This brought our total cash return to shareholders to $1.4 billion for the quarter or 72% of free cash flow. And we see no change to the $1 billion share repurchase outlook for 2020 that we first communicated during our call last October. Chart 7 shows our backlog balance through first quarter of 2020. While delivering our highest first quarter sales ever, we increased our backlog balance for the seventh consecutive quarter driven by bookings at Sikorsky and missile programs at Missiles and Fire Control. Moving on to Chart 8. Based on our view of COVID-19-related potential impacts, as Marillyn noted, we are lowering the midpoint of our guidance range on sales by $375 million while holding our guidance for segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And as we disclosed in the earnings release, our joint venture, AMMROC, in the UAE lost a key contract award after the end of the quarter, and we are still working the assessment of a potential noncash impairment that could be recorded as early as the second quarter once our review is finalized. On Chart 9, we have shown the adjustments to our sales guidance range. Likely COVID-19 impacts on our supply chain and related potential delivery delays have caused us to reduce our full year outlook for Aeronautics. Our expectations for 2020 sales in all other business areas remain consistent with what we discussed in January. On Chart 10, we show our outlook for segment operating profit by business area. While the guidance for profit has been lowered for aeronautics following sales, we have raised our guidance range from Missiles and Fire Control and Space, holding our total segment operating profit consistent -- constant from January's outlook. On Chart 11, we outlined some specific assumptions we are using in our 2020 guidance related to the current impacts of COVID-19. We continue to monitor the situation daily as it remains a dynamic environment. And as Marillyn highlighted, we are proactively taking steps to help support our suppliers and teammates during this difficult time. Our current expectation is that the next few months will be the peak of disruption as the country and the rest of the world looks to successfully flatten the curve move forward. The Department of Defense and the United States government have also taken action to support our industry through policy changes and the CARES Act, and our outlook has taken into consideration these benefits. Together, these actions have allowed us to update the outlook we provided in January with minimal impacts. And to conclude, on Chart 12, we have our summary. We believe that the first quarter of 2020 has laid the foundation for a strong year. We have a robust backlog to sustain our growth. Our sales outlook is growing year-over-year and represents an approximately 6% increase from 2019. Along with consistent profit and positive cash flow, this allows us to project strong results for 2020 for shareholders as we continue to support our employees, customers and supply chain during these difficult times. So before we move to Q&A, I would like to take a moment to congratulate Marillyn on her upcoming transition and thank her for the outstanding leadership she has provided Lockheed Martin over the last 7.5 years. As Chairman, President and CEO, the corporation has reached new heights and delivered remarkable results from our customers and shareholders. Marillyn, during your 37 years with the company, we have all employees, customers, teammates and shareholders benefited from your dedication, inspiration and vision. You and I have worked together for 20 years, and on a personal note, I would like to add that I will also miss your friendship and partnership. Although your presence will certainly be missed on a day-to-day basis, we look forward to continuing to work with you as Executive Chairman of the Board. And I'd also like to welcome Jim Taiclet as our incoming President and CEO, who begins on June 15. I have worked with Jim as a Board member for more than a year while I've been in my current role, and I believe he will be an outstanding leader for our company. And with that, I'd like to wish Marillyn the best of luck, and I look forward to welcoming Jim in June. John, we are ready to begin the Q&A. You bet. Thanks, Joe. So it's probably helpful we start with, once this started, what our processes were. Think of this as our battle rhythm. So once this began, we started a weekly COVID-19 impact tracking process. We put together a template, and this was generally across the board, included all the business areas. We had data that we collected that supported various internal and external reporting. In fact, we're now in a rhythm where Marillyn is now sending a memo to the SAEs, think of those as the service acquisition executives. And this is done on a weekly basis. That basically lays out all the impacts that we see, all the actions that we're taking to minimize those impacts. And think of these inputs as at the contract program level, so across the corporation. It's about 600 line items, and it's tracking real and potential Lockheed Martin supplier- and government-driven impacts. The COVID impacts that we're seeing are reflected within this weekly template. And unfortunately, they're predominantly risk-related. Think of them as travel restrictions and site access that are most likely the common cited driver of impact. We're seeing increases in supplier shortages. And in our sites, we're seeing some absenteeism impacts. There are some opportunities that we do see that exist, Joe. From a cash flow standpoint, the customer altered the progress payment rate from 80% to 90%. And also a small nuance but important, they changed some conditions regarding progress payment rates, which will be advantageous to us. And we are now flowing this -- as Marillyn mentioned, we are flowing this all down to our supply base. Starting with our small suppliers and our vulnerable suppliers, we have a process where we work with supply chain. They tell us who those suppliers are. We work with Treasury to determine on a weekly basis the cash flow that we have that we're flowing that down. Contract actions that we're working with our customer, it's accelerated timing of the pending awards, undefinitized contract actions, or UCAs, funding, et cetera. What we're also seeing internally is there -- we're capturing cost avoidance. So think of lack of travel, lack of business trips that we're making, lack of sponsorships, lack of air shows that we're going to. And we're capturing that and collecting that, probably not to take to the bottom line but to help with impact disruptions to our business. You talked about the recovery of costs with the CARES Act. One of the conditions in there is we will work with the PCO and demonstrate to them a request for equitable adjustment that those costs -- those idle costs should be deemed allowable, and we'll work through that. In fact, we have a path forward on the F-35 program to do just that. So we think we're in a good position. The plan is, at least the way we see it, is we're hoping that the curve starts flattening in the second quarter, end of second quarter, and we can get to some kind of semblance of business as usual, whatever that is, starting in the third quarter. You asked about cash, Joe, we feel really good about our cash, and I'll let somebody else -- I'll give some more color on cash for somebody else to ask the question, but we feel really good about our cash flow this year. We started the year strong, ended the first quarter strong, and we see, going forward, strong. So thanks, Joe. Stay safe. Hunter, we'll give Marillyn a break since it's her last earnings call. So I'll take that. So it's going well. So as everybody is aware, I believe, we moved the F-16 program out of Fort Worth a couple of years ago. Frankly, no home because we didn't have any orders of record and Bahrain was our first customer. We moved the line to Greenville, going very well. Right now, we have Bahrain. You saw we just announced Bulgaria. We have Slovakia. We're in the throes of working with the United States government and Taiwan for them to buy 66 aircraft. There is an African country that is interested in F-16. So we're hopeful that will happen. South American country, and then there are some Southeast Asian countries that are interested in F-16 as well. So we think the program is doing very well. The MOD programs are doing very well. Just in the spirit of COVID, we're not seeing many impacts at all on the F-16 program. So I think this is a good fourth-generation aircraft for those customers that can't afford the F-35 or, frankly, can't at this time buy the F-35. And it might be a good intermediary step for customers to go from the F-16 to F-35. So we see it frankly as complementary and not competing against themselves. Sure. Pete, it's Ken. I'll take that. So let's talk Aeronautics, and then I'll go around the other business areas. So Aeronautics, we looked at -- we started seeing that it is likely there is going to be -- and I'd say it's probable that there's going to be some supply chain disruption. What we're seeing is there's local distancing requirements that are being more stringently applied across the globe. There's workforce disruption. There are likely impacts that are happening throughout their supply tier hierarchy. There are shipping constraints. We've actually had some issues with shipping constraints. We're also finding there's likely going to be some production impacts at our site. And based on that, the analysis to date had given us concern. So we reduced our guidance at Aeronautics. And specifically, it's F-35 production. There's more analysis that we're going to do over the next couple of weeks working with our supply chain and our Fort Worth production line and our customers to set -- to determine, if any, impact, to what extent it will be on the program, including deliveries. In fact, last night, I got some feedback from the supply chain team, and this is specific to F-35 and specific to production. We're seeing some pressure regarding supplier performance-based payment invoices. So this is -- these are invoices that they could deliver to us after they completed a milestone. There are a couple of suppliers that are going to be delinquent in April. Some of them are for administrative reasons. We'll work through that. So that's just timing. But some of them -- and some are domestic, U.S.-based, and some of them are international, that it is due to them not achieving their milestones. Some of it is going to be COVID-related, probably most of it is COVID-related. We're looking at that. So we then did an analysis, a bunch of sensitivity analysis with the Aeronautics team. And if you look at F-35, we're seeing little to no impact to development. We're able to continue to work on follow-on modernization. That is what typically is happening on the development program. Sustainment, generally speaking, the team does not see any impact. And if they do see impact, back to Joe's question about the recoverability of the costs, we feel comfortable due to the CARES Act. If we have somebody who can't get on base to do, say, a repair, if you will, or to stand up a base and they're sent home and they're not able to do productive work at home, we are believing those costs are recoverable. And so it's all down to production. We have seen in the past some impacts at the Japanese FACO, they're up and running now; and at the Italian FACO, but on the whole, they're up and running as well. So it was our determination based on what we're seeing that it was prudent for us to take our production sales down. Hopefully, this is a conservative number, but based on what we're seeing, we think this is a good number. You asked about the other business areas and why we're not seeing impacts there right now. So I'll start with Space. So think of their production cycle, it's a long production cycle. And generally speaking, what -- any issues that they would see in the supply chain or at our facilities, they feel they could contain. So it's low volume, certainly, relative to F-35 production line. They have an engineering workforce. They were one of the first ones to be -- they were the first ones, frankly, in our company to be impacted by this. They're now staggering their shifts. They're staggering the days that people come into the office. It is impacting some of their classified programs, but we seem to be doing a nice job working around that. So we feel good with their guidance right now. RMS, they don't have the volume. So talk -- the manufacturing floor, they don't have the volume of Fort Worth. Think of their volume more like Marietta. And I did -- I was remiss not to talk about Marietta. So there are some suppliers where we are impacted that we are doing workarounds and we do think we have a containment plan. So we do see some modest impact at Marietta, but it's not material. So I would state that RMS is more like Marietta. So there are some issues there, but they're not material in nature. Their engineering team, so the folks that are doing engineering work at RMS, are still productive. There are some base and range closures that are impacting RMS, but we seem to have workarounds and so we don't see any impact there. The next concern we would have is at Missiles and Fire Control. And it's just based on the -- it's a high-volume business. They have done a nice job of looking through their supply chain. They have made contact with 100% of their suppliers. And before -- last week, I would have told you, 6% are forecasting impacts. In Maryland staff meeting, we found out yesterday, it's up to 10%. So they actually have a very robust process of talking through their supply base. They had 2 suppliers that had closed operations. One of them we're still working through and working through second sources and also containment plans for them. And another one had an operation in Mexico. We worked through that and got that one open. So we feel good right now where Missiles and Fire Control as well -- where they are as well from a guidance standpoint. But that would be our next worry bead would be Missiles and Fire Control. So net-net, we're good with guidance at the other 3. We think we've thought through the Aeronautics one -- Aeronautics issues, and we feel good about that. And just -- we've looked across the portfolio, and not just COVID-related risk, but we've looked at, call it, business as usual opportunity and risk, and we think we've box-balanced everything, and we feel good about our guidance as it stands today. You bet. Thanks, David. So yes, we -- like I said, we feel good about cash flow this year. And I'll say it again. If it wasn't for COVID-19, we were very comfortable with taking our cash from operations up -- our cash from operations number of greater than $7.6 billion. So yes, going into the first quarter, we did increase payables. We did pay down payables in the fourth quarter. Part of the reason why Aeronautics and a couple other business areas did so well was, frankly, we got invoices -- from a timing standpoint, we got invoices in -- late in the quarter that ended up being payables, so we had abnormally high payables that also then flowed into inventory or into contract assets, which we do think is an opportunity going forward for us. So even with the COVID impacts, we do see, over time, working capital increases, specifically in contract assets, most of them in F-35, and we're working with the F-35. We think there's an opportunity there for us to reduce our contract assets. The other thing I would state is -- why we had the high payables in the first quarter is these COVID actions that Marillyn described of us flowing money down to the supply chain really didn't start happening for the most part until we got into the second quarter. So we'll continue to flow down that committed $450 million that we got certainly through the second quarter, but David, it's likely we're going to flow that down in the third and fourth quarter as well, and we will probably take our -- what I'll call our normal payables number down in the fourth quarter and accelerate payments to the small business base and our vulnerable suppliers. You bet. Yes. So Rob, I'll give you just a little color of what we've done actually. So late last year, we entered into a 10b5-1, and think of that as an enhanced open market repurchase program. So we essentially went to the banks late last year and said, we want to buy $500 million to $600 million of stock back starting in January through July. So we're in this 10b5-1 through July. And in the first quarter, of that, we bought $256 million back of the $756 million that you heard me state we bought back in the first quarter. Early in the year, we thought it would be advantageous just to go on autopilot, if you will, and we signed up. This would be our second one, we did one in the fourth quarter of last year, an accelerated share repurchase program. And as you know, when you commit to that, you put the money upfront, gives the bank then the discretion to buy it back when they want to buy it back. So we fronted that money, if you will, in the first quarter. And that plan goes through the end of April. So think of that in 9 days, that program is over. So that's why you saw the amount we bought back was earmarked $756 million of repos in the quarter. As I stated, we reaffirmed -- and Marillyn just foot stomped that, we reaffirmed our $1 billion commitment, which basically will be on autopilot that will go through July. So think of us buying back another $244 million over the next couple -- next 2 months to get us to the $1 billion. And what we have done in the past, just frankly over the last couple of years, we've done this just to prevent dilution of our share count, and that's what we're committed on now. If we get out of this COVID situation, we may look at this again and readdress it and see if it makes sense to opportunistically buy our stock back if we think that makes sense. But in the meantime, while COVID is going on, our commitment is we're going to maximize our balance sheet to generate cash flow, and we're going to send as much down as we can -- and as much as we can down to our distressed vulnerable supply base and our small supply base. While we're on capital deployment, I'll talk about dividends. It is from a planning standpoint. Our plan, subject to the Board's approval, for us still to declare and pay dividends. So that's in our modeling for the rest of the year. And I'll just remind you, we're still spending, investing in our business roughly $1.3 billion in IRAD for this year. And as I stated earlier, we're still on a path from a CapEx standpoint to spend roughly $1.7 billion on CapEx. So we're not skirting our responsibilities to our supply chain nor to the investments we believe we need to make for us to be a vibrant business going forward. Yes. Thanks, Peter. Yes, the plan is we still think we're going to grow our backlog. I mentioned earlier for one of the questions, we're working with the -- I'll talk United States first, the United States customer. We're working with them where it makes sense for us to accelerate orders to get that into our backlog, to get that behind us. You already saw F-35 Lot 14 was in the second quarter. We got that order behind us. And that does actually have some international customers. Think of 35%, 40% of those airplanes will be going to international customers. But there are a bunch of international orders, and I'll go through them, that we generally feel pretty good about. So Bulgaria is behind us for F-16. We got those 8 aircraft behind us. We're working with Indonesia on some C-130 aircraft. We feel good about that. Working with India, you probably saw the announcement that the money is flowing from India to the United States. So we'll now work with the appropriate government agencies to get that under contract. That's for the MH-60R multi-role helicopter program. We have a Spain F-110 frigate program we feel good about. F-16, Taiwan, I mentioned, that's a third quarter order. We still feel good about that. We also have a couple of orders for F-16 that we're working to try to shape. There's a Norway contract out in the fourth quarter. So I'd say on the whole, we're feeling good about our order book. And in fact, because of some accelerations, we actually think we'll overachieve our orders planned this year by over $3 billion. And that's mainly driven by PAC-3, that's FY '21, where I think we're in a good spot with the customer to accelerate those orders. John, I think we have time for one more question."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. And I hope you\u2019ve had a good start to the New Year. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call as we review our results, key business area accomplishments and our outlook for 2022. I\u2019ll begin with an update regarding our proposed acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings. As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we thought it highly likely that the FTC would sue to block the transaction. Since that time, we have received notification from the FTC that they have, in fact, authorized filing a lawsuit. We will review the lawsuit and evaluate all of our options. With the filing of the suit, we may elect to defend the lawsuit or terminate the merger agreement. Moving on to our financial results. In a few minutes, John will discuss our financials in detail and provide our outlook for 2022. But I first would like to begin with a few highlights from the quarter and the year. In October, after we concluded our financial planning process, we established an updated forecast for 2021, which we achieved or exceeded. We met our $67 billion sales forecast, and our segment operating profit and earnings per share both exceeded our projections. Our cash from operations was exceptionally strong, over $9.2 billion, supporting our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process. During the year, we made significant investments in our signature platforms and systems as well as emerging technologies, all to meet the rapidly evolving challenges, as we see every day in the news now, the challenges that our customers are facing and to support future growth for the benefit of our shareholders. Moreover, we continue reshaping and modernizing our operations to increase efficiencies and reduce costs so we can deliver affordable solutions for our customers going forward as well. During 2021, we spent $1.5 billion on independent research and development, a new high watermark for the Company. Notable areas of our IR&D efforts included hypersonics, directed energy and artificial intelligence. We also initiated the development of mission-based technology roadmaps and advanced our 5G.MIL architecture to truly enable joint all-domain operations across multiple platforms, U.S. military services and allies. These investments position the Company to meet our customers\u2019 most critical needs well into the future. During the year, we also spent $1.5 billion on capital expenditures, focused on addressing customers\u2019 program requirements and supporting our organic growth outlook. Significant capital projects included the introduction of three new state-of-the-art factories of the future, additional adoption of cutting-edge software and hardware solutions to enable model-based engineering throughout the Company, and the establishment of production facilities to support our key hypersonics program. During the fourth quarter, we brought many of these elements together for the opening of an intelligent advanced hypersonic strike production facility in Courtland, Alabama, supporting both our Missiles and Fire Control and Space hypersonic programs. This facility integrates critical digital transformation advancements such as robotic thermal protection capabilities into our manufacturing operations and represents our long-term investment in this critical technology. The Courtland facility joins our new spacecraft Test Assembly and Resource Center in Titusville, Florida and our recently opened 215,000 square-foot advanced manufacturing facility in our Skunk Works organization in Palmdale, California. Together, these facilities add to our intelligent factory framework, digitally linking sites and assets across the enterprise to speed production, provide cost efficiencies and drive future margin improvements throughout the Company. From a capital return perspective, during the quarter, we executed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program and thereby retired nearly 6 million shares under that agreement. This brought our total 2021 repurchase amount to over $4 billion, which when coupled with our strong dividend payments resulted in a total of $7 billion of cash returned to our shareholders during the year. We will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases and expect to utilize our remaining $4 billion authorization in 2022. I\u2019ll now touch briefly on the Department of Defense budgets. This quarter, Congress passed the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act with strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. The NDAA policy bill was subsequently signed into law by President Biden. This legislation authorizes a $25 billion increase for the Department of Defense for a total of approximately $740 billion for defense programs and raised the investment accounts approximately 8% above the President\u2019s originally requested amounts. Currently, the DoD is operating under a continuing resolution through February 18th for FY 2022. As Congress continues the appropriations process, we believe our programs are well supported, reflecting the fact that our portfolio is aligned with affordably delivering our customers\u2019 national security capabilities. Now -- turning now to our growth strategy. Last quarter, we discussed our long-term expectations, which anticipate that our sales will increase by approximately 2% in 2023 with steadily increasing sales growth through 2026. As we discussed in October, the four primary areas that underpin this longer-term growth forecast are programs of record, classified activities, hypersonics and new business awards. Expansion in our program of records is a clear key pillar of our long-term growth strategy. In this quarter, we are pleased to see two new customers select our signature programs to support their national security objectives. Last month, the government of Finland selected the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter as the winning entry in their HX Fighter Program competition, citing the aircraft\u2019s affordability as well as its combat, reconnaissance and survival capabilities is best suited to deliver on the HX requirements. This announcement for 64 conventional takeoff and landing stealth fighters has a potential contract value of over $9 billion and follows Switzerland\u2019s decision to purchase 36 F-35s. These announcements highlight the momentum that is building in this program with future international opportunities in Canada and elsewhere to go in front of us. Our Rotary and Mission Systems team also secured an important international opportunity this past quarter as the Israeli Air Force signed a letter of acceptance with the United States government to pursue the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter. This agreement enables the Israeli Air Force to procure 12 53Ks with the option to buy another half dozen. If fully exercised, those options could exceed $2 billion in value. Israel then be our first international CH-53K customer as they look to replace their current fleet of legacy Sikorsky CH-53 helicopters, which have been flying over 50 years. Another pillar of our long-term growth strategy, our classified activities, also saw momentum build in the fourth quarter. Our Space business area was awarded a contract by the U.S. Air Force to develop and classify -- fly a prototype RF payloads in space. Our solution leverages ongoing internal investments on our LM 400 satellite bus, providing greater mission flexibility and longer-duration orbit life. This award for initial engineering contract includes options to deliver an operational system with the potential for this to grow into a new franchise program down the road. And on a final note, 2021 presented a challenging environment for both commercial and defense industries, especially in terms of continuing COVID-19 effects and supply chain impacts. Our teams in all 4 Lockheed Martin business areas and across our corporate functions banded together and did a tremendous job maintaining our production operations and advancing science and engineering on behalf of our customers. I\u2019m extremely proud of the perseverance and dedication of our entire organization, and I know that as One Lockheed Martin, we\u2019re going to drive future growth into our business and advance our vision to accelerate 21st Century Digital World Technologies into our national defense enterprise. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to John and join you later to answer your questions.\nJohn Mollard: All right. Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we\u2019ve included with our earnings release today. Let\u2019s begin with chart 3 and an overview of 2021 results. Starting with sales, we recorded revenue of $67 billion, which was consistent with the guidance we provided in October. This record level of sales was made possible by an exceptionally strong fourth quarter of delivering affordable, relevant solutions to our customers. Additionally, our segment operating profit of $7.4 billion and earnings per share of $22.76 exceeded our October projections, driven by strong operational performance across the entire portfolio. We generated more than $9.2 billion in operating cash flow this year. And as we discussed last quarter, we are committed to a strategy of disciplined and dynamic capital allocation. We continue reshaping our operations and identifying ways we can increase efficiencies and reduce costs. As Jim mentioned, we invested $3 billion in research and development and capital expenditures to help our customers achieve their missions and to drive organic growth. In addition to this internal reinvestment, we repurchased over $4 billion of shares in 2021, including $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Combined with increased annual dividend payments of approximately $3 billion, we returned just over $7 billion to shareholders. Looking forward, our outlook for 2022 remains consistent with our October trending information as we build our foundation for growth in 2023 and beyond. Turning to chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year\u2019s results. Sales and segment operating profit both increased 3% compared to 2020 results and represent high watermarks for the Company. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the year. Our full year earnings per share of $22.76 incorporates the $4.72 noncash charge associated with the $4.9 billion pension liability transfer that we completed during the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, our pre-transaction EPS of $27.48 was 12% higher than our 2020 results due to increased volume and improved segment operating margin, gains in our Lockheed Martin Ventures portfolio, increased FAS/CAS pension income, and a reduction in share count. On chart 6, we look at our full year cash generation and deployment. 2021 cash performance was outstanding as we generated over $9.2 billion in operating cash flow and $7.7 billion in free cash flow. We returned 91% of this free cash flow to our shareholders through increased share repurchases and dividends. Our remaining share repurchase authority is approximately $4 billion, and we expect to opportunistically deploy that entire amount in 2022. Moving on to chart 7 and our 2022 guidance. Consistent with our October trading information, we estimate 2022 sales at approximately $66 billion and segment operating profit of approximately $7.2 billion, resulting in a segment operating margin of 10.9%. FAS/CAS pension income is projected at $2.26 billion, which is $60 million higher than the $2.2 billion estimate we provided in October. We are projecting earnings per share of $26.70, and our estimate for 2022 cash from operations remains at greater than or equal to $8.4 billion, excluding the impacts of the R&D capitalization tax law change, which we now estimate at approximately $500 million. I should mention, there is still a possibility that legislation will be enacted that defers or refuels the requirement to capitalize R&D expenditures from a tax payment perspective, but we are including the impact of higher tax payments in our current outlook as we will be required to make these payments unless existing law is amended by legislation. On chart 8, we show our updated three-year forecast for cash generation. Our outstanding fourth quarter cash flow was driven by a tightly coordinated collections process across all business areas and functional support organizations, leading to exceptional collection results from both domestic and international customers. Partially offsetting this upside was an increase of $700 million in accelerated payments we made to our supply chain during the fourth quarter. With the emergence of the Omicron variant and surges in COVID cases, we increased total accelerated payments to over $2.2 billion at year-end and our continuing effort to mitigate supply chain risk. Our outstanding collection performance and the increase in accelerated payments to our supply chain partners resulted in our generating $9.2 billion in cash from operations and $7.7 billion in free cash flow. Over the three-year period from 2021 through 2023 and before considering the potential impacts of R&D capitalization, we now project total cash from operations of greater than or equal to $26.1 billion, which is $900 million higher than our prior estimate. This increase was driven by our fourth quarter results and our expectation that we will maintain this extremely high level of performance throughout the forecast period. Generating over $25 billion in operating cash flow after incorporating the potential $900 million impact of R&D capitalization provides significant support for our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation strategy. On chart 9, we break out our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business areas. Our estimates for the year remain consistent with the trending information we provided in October as we focus on long-term growth opportunities and building on the strong operational results we delivered in the fourth quarter. And on chart 10 to summarize, we successfully closed out 2021 with all metrics equal to or better than the guidance we provided in October, highlighted by exceptional cash generation. With our strong balance sheet and our demonstrated ability to generate high levels of operating cash flow, we are well-positioned to execute on our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation strategy for years to come. I\u2019m excited about our opportunities in 2022 as we deliver mission capabilities for our customers and long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, John, we\u2019re ready to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll go to the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Jim, so I figured I\u2019d try to ask about the news of the day on the Aerojet deal. You mentioned defend or terminate on the kind of the pending transaction. Can you give us really any color on the time line that you at least plan to evaluate the lawsuit? And if you do choose to terminate, would you expect to kind of redeploy those proceeds towards capital deployment, or are you preferring kind of pursuing your M&A strategy?\nJim Taiclet: So, Peter, our merger agreement with Aerojet Rocketdyne allows for a 30-day period post filing of a lawsuit to make that decision of either defend or terminate the agreement. So, we\u2019ll be working with our Board over the next few days and weeks to make that determination.\nJohn Mollard: And cash deployment?\nJim Taiclet: Well, of course, I mean, it\u2019s a great opportunity actually with your question, Peter, to speak to what John and I have been talking about here, disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process. So basically, we array and assess all the alternative uses of capital and through a lens of what\u2019s the most beneficial for the shareholder, what\u2019s the best long-term ROI for that dollar of cash flow. And we look at the array of IR&D CapEx that I just talked about. Last year, it was about $3 billion in total. We made those investments because we think for organic or new business growth, they\u2019re going to have great ROIs and they\u2019re going to get the first call on our investment. But we don\u2019t have an unlimited set of opportunities, so to speak, in either R&D or CapEx. So, it\u2019s bounded. So then we look at inorganic growth opportunities, which could be M&A, joint ventures, et cetera. Those that are available are not necessarily expansive right now, let\u2019s say. And so, then that leads you then to share repurchase and dividend growth, which is where the bulk of our funds are going these days, as you\u2019ve heard from John. So, it\u2019s dynamic and disciplined. That\u2019s what we mean by it is we\u2019re going to look across all those opportunity sets, look for the best ROI for the shareholder down the road, and then we\u2019re going to allocate that capital there. And we don\u2019t need to grow our cash balance. We have upside, I\u2019d say, on leverage, should we choose to take it down the road. So, you\u2019re going to see us continue to allocate capital in that way. So, we\u2019re not just going to sit back and say, well, whether AJRD goes through or not, we\u2019re just going to sort of sit back on our capital and let it grow in the cash count. We\u2019re going to keep allocating it dynamically to the most and best how it\u2019s used.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays Capital. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: I wanted to ask within the guidance for this year what you\u2019re assuming with regard to the CR. And then, Jim, you mentioned the plus up on the authorization side. If we ultimately see that come through in terms of appropriations, what might that do to your prior guidance for 2% 2023 growth? And I guess, the last one, just, John, if you can comment on what changed on the R&D capitalization side, taking it down from $2 billion impact to $500 million? Thanks.\nJim Taiclet: Sure. So, I\u2019ll start off, it\u2019s Jim here, and then turn it over to John. So it really was encouraging what Congress came out with in the NDAA. From a program perspective, it was excellent for the Company, 9 additional Black Hawks, 2 additional CH-53K in the NDAA, 4 additional C-130Js and 12 more that interceptors. And beyond that, there was increased funding for some of our tactical and strike missile programs as well. So really solid literally across the Company impact of the NDAA. We\u2019re assuming that the continuing resolution does get resolved at some point by September 31, 2022. And the impact of that NDAA, and hopefully the defense budget appropriation coming along with it, will be really to build the pipeline of future revenue for us. It\u2019s -- given there\u2019s only sort of 7 or 8 months in the fiscal year left in the first place, we have most of our revenue visibility already in process of production orders and deliveries. So John, I\u2019ll give it back to you. But basically, it\u2019s -- those plus ups are longer-term value creators for us and the shareholder, not necessarily going to hit meaningfully in the next, say, six to seven months.\nJohn Mollard: Yes. And just to put a point on the CR impact, it would take pretty much a full year CR to have any sort of impact on our revenue that you would see. The biggest impact will be to our customers\u2019 ability to prosecute their missions, especially in program areas where requirements would have us on a trajectory to grow. And obviously, with the CR, you\u2019re not able to grow program requirements. So absent a full year CR, I would anticipate relatively de minimis impact on the forecast we\u2019ve given. And I think your -- next question was around the change in the R&D tax payment assumption. I think last -- historically, we\u2019ve talked about a number of $2 billion. I think last quarter, it was probably a little more subtle than you would have thought. We\u2019ve kind of changed the definition to say, \"Hey, we could see up to $2 billion.\" I\u2019ll start by saying there\u2019s still a possibility that legislation is going to get enacted that will end up in this getting deferred or repealed, and I said that in the script. But given the number one vehicle to have that done is the President build back better legislation and given where that is, the path to enactment remains unclear right now. But we do, however, believe there\u2019s recognition by Congress that legislation is needed to address this critical aspect of R&D activities. It\u2019s really not at all consistent with our nation\u2019s public policy objectives. Now, specific to the change in the amount from up to $2 billion to the approximately $500 million we\u2019ve got in our guidance. One of the first reviews I had with our tax team after taking on my current role is to understand the assumptions that were used in calculating that projected impact. I have a bunch of questions about these assumptions, and as 2022 grew closer without any form of legislative action, we refined our analysis and then shared that with external advisors. And what we did -- we concluded that the capitalization provision scope was narrow than what we had originally assumed. We\u2019ve historically claimed the R&D tax credit on certain activities. And after discussion with our advisors, we determined that the R&D tax credit framework is relevant in establishing the scope of R&D activity that will require capitalization. So, as a result, we\u2019ve updated our estimated impact to reflect the value that is consistent with the provisions of the tax code.\nOperator: Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JP Morgan.\nSeth Seifman: John, I was just looking at the outlook for Aeronautics this year and kind of the 10.5% margin rate, which if we add back the second quarter charge to 2021, margin was well above that and above that in each of the quarters. So, can you talk about the mechanics of what\u2019s driving down profitability in Aeronautics this year and then how you see that trending going forward beyond \u201822?\nJohn Mollard: Yes, absolutely. Good question. Probably the two biggest, I\u2019ll call them, dilutive impacts on margins in \u201822 is the growth in our classified activity in Skunk Works. These are predominantly very good ROI programs, but their margins that they attract that given the lower financial risk associated with these programs are going to be dilutive. So, we\u2019re projecting growth in the Skunk Works operation of roughly $300 million that\u2019s coming in. That\u2019s going to be dilutive. And then, we\u2019ve got a lot of growth in our F-16 program, and given where that program is, I mean we\u2019re roughly a year out from first deliveries on the F-16 line with the ramp that we\u2019re expecting. We\u2019re projecting revenue to increase on F-16 roughly $300 million. Given where that program is in its life cycle, we think it\u2019s prudent to reflect typically prudent but relatively conservative margins on that growth. And as a result, you\u2019re going to see a reduction in margins in 2022 on the F-16 program. Those are probably the two biggest dilutive margin growth areas within Aeronautics. I think longer term, the key to growing margins in Aeronautics is going to be performing on the delivery of the F-35 production program. And that\u2019s going to require us to perform on delivering the enhanced capabilities that our customers need that we\u2019ve talked about a lot in keeping, for example, the TR3 infrastructure upgrade program on track, keeping the mission capability expansions on track. I\u2019m fully confident we will be able to achieve our internal operating metrics. And if we do, there will be upside.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley.\nKristine Liwag: It seems like there\u2019s more urgency from the Pentagon in hypersonics. Can you provide an update on where your various hypersonic programs are progressing? And should we see an acceleration from your $3 billion outlook by 2025?\nJim Taiclet: Yes. Good morning, Kristine. I\u2019ve just returned a couple of weeks ago from opening up that Courtland facility in Alabama. And two of our, I guess, marquee programs and those that are perhaps among the furthest along, in fact, three programs are going to be produced there. And I\u2019ll just mention them really briefly. It\u2019s a complicated set of systems. But a couple to keep in mind are what the Navy calls Conventional Prompt Strike or CPS. That\u2019s a hypersonic missile of some size that has very good range and will be launched from submarines and ultimately from destroyer-type shifts. In concert with the development of that strike product, the Army has teamed up with the Navy, which is somewhat innovative and novel for them, for what they call the Long-Range Hypersonics Weapon program, so LRHW. The Army intends to use a very similar missile but launch from ground units through what\u2019s called a TEL. TEL stands for Transporter Erector Launcher. We\u2019ve already delivered the first training unit of that TEL to the Army. So, they\u2019re working with that today. The missiles will be produced in the Courtland factory over the next few years. And we\u2019ll be serving the Navy and the Army from there. The third product that we intend to produce in the Courtland facility is for the Air Force, and that\u2019s called ARRW or A-R-R-W, so Advanced Rapid Response Weapon. That\u2019s an air-launched missile that travels with hypersonic speeds, and we\u2019re testing those at Edwards Air Force base now on B-52 bombers as the carriers there. So we\u2019re going through test events in that program with the Air Force. And over the next couple of years, we hope to be making the production runs on those as well. So, that\u2019s the summary. Again, there\u2019s more to the story, but I think those are the highlights, CPS, the advanced air-launched weapon and then the long-range hypersonics for the Army.\nJohn Mollard: And Kristine, this is John. To your question on the long-range guide, I think I\u2019ll stick with the $3 billion sort of revenue forecast in 2026. There are opportunities to grow it. As Jim mentioned, there\u2019s operational urgencies driving our customers to push us to go faster and faster. There\u2019s emerging activity in counter hypersonics that -- maybe of some note that we\u2019ll keep an eye on that could provide upside to that forecast. But I think for modeling purposes, I\u2019m comfortable with $3 billion.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Rich Safran with Seaport Global Securities.\nRich Safran: If it\u2019s okay, I have two. I think they\u2019re very quick questions. So, on the supply chain issues last quarter and the accelerated $2.2 billion in payments you accelerated to suppliers that were going to be made in \u201822. If I look at 4Q results, I\u2019m just wondering if supply chain issues that hit you in three quarter -- third quarter are now behind you. I\u2019m just curious if the risk has been meaningfully reduced. You expected them to impact you on \u201822 and wondering if the outlook has improved and what that means about your guide. Second question, if you have to abandon the Aerojet deal, just wondering if that has any impact on your hypersonics strategy.\nJohn Mollard: Yes. Rich, I\u2019ll take the first one, and I\u2019ll let Jim take the second one. Just in general, as you pointed out, we accelerated substantially more payments to our supply chain during the fourth quarter than we even talked about back in October when at the time, we had $1.5 billion accelerated, and we said that we would anticipate maintaining that level through the year-end. But given the global COVID situation and the ongoing fragility in our supply chain, we decided that increasing the level of accelerated payments to our partners was a prudent risk mitigation strategy. And to your point about, are you hitting your marks, I\u2019ll give a lot of credit to our global supply chain leadership team. They\u2019ve been actively working with all of our suppliers to ensure we\u2019re collectively positioned to meet our customer requirements, and that includes like embedding our own Lockheed Martin personnel within their facilities to help with the stresses that they\u2019re facing. And as a result, I think a proactive activity by our supply chain leadership team, I was encouraged to see that our fourth quarter supply chain activity was in line with the expectations we set in October, which assumes some level of recovery from October -- from what we saw in the third quarter. But there is still no doubt an overhang on the ability of our supply chain really to pivot to normal changes and requirements. So, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re all the way out of the woods, but I think we\u2019re focused -- we\u2019ve got laser-like focused from both a management involvement point of view and financial support.\nJim Taiclet: And Rich, I\u2019d just summarize all that by saying we think the bow wave has passed in supply chain disruption for Lockheed Martin, but we\u2019re still watching it closely. And as John just said, not all the risk is out of the system yet.\nJohn Mollard: On the hypersonic strategy, I\u2019m just going to take AJRD out of the discussion, but I will tell you this. So for us and our customer base, which is basically the three largest military services in the United States, we\u2019ve all agreed jointly to kind of a go-fast approach to development, which means there\u2019s a little more risk in the development sequence, if you will, develop and test, learn the lessons and then redesign. So, we\u2019re doing that jointly. And one of the benefits of integrating somewhat vertically with propulsion and what\u2019s called the glide body, which is the heat-absorbing part of the missile, and then the full air system that supports the missile either out of the tube or off the airplane. The more you can integrate that engineering organization, probably the faster you could go, but we can manage it as we do today with the propulsion provider outside of Lockheed Martin. So, we\u2019ll continue to manage it as we have. We think we could have gotten the speed and efficiency increase by partial vertical integration hypersonics through the AJRD acquisition specifically. But we can still manage it whichever way that deal turns out.\nOperator: And we\u2019ll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Stallard: Jim, I was wondering if you could give us an update on the F-35 sustainment situation. There obviously continued to be press noise about this, and whether you\u2019ve made any progress on bringing that cost per hour down? Thank you.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. I think we made great progress over the past year by really bringing attention and integration between the joint program office, these key services that fly the airplane and Lockheed Martin and actually Pratt & Whitney also is the suppliers. So, we\u2019ve all joined together in a way that I think might even be unprecedented in that we all realize we have a shared goal to reduce the cost per flight hour and improve the readiness rate of the jet. And we\u2019re all working together to do that. So, we\u2019ve had some successes where we\u2019ve got long lead time spare part orders already through the system, and that will help with having enough spare parts in the right places at the right time to reduce costs and improve the readiness rate. We\u2019ve also received a request for proposal for somewhat more limited, but nonetheless, a PBL or performance-based logistics program that we, again, together agreed, let\u2019s really focus on the supply chain side of that, which you can integrate with production parts planning and sustainment parts planning. You always want to -- if you can keep those together. That\u2019s where this PBL is largely focused, less so on sort of the labor piece of it, which we\u2019ll figure out as we go with the government, what happens in our supply chain, what happens at Lockheed Martin, what happens in depots. But the bulk of the value will be in the parts flow, distribution, production integration, et cetera. That is, I think, a three-year PBL. We hope to get that negotiated over the next coming months or quarters, if you will. So, I think, we\u2019re really well on the road to having a much more coherent and integrated industry customer program office approach to sustainment. And we\u2019ve already got good progress in getting some of the cost per hour down even as we speak.\nJohn Mollard: Yes. Just to kind of put a quantitative mention on what Jim was talking about. So, at the end of the year of 2021, we had 753 fielded aircraft. And based on the production plan, that number of fielded aircraft is going to grow from 753 to like 1,525 aircraft, which is a 15% compound annual growth rate, and the number of fielded aircraft and the flight hour growth rate even faster. So, you can think of sustainable cost as a function of flight hours. The flight hours are growing over 16%. And I think we gave you a long-term sustainment revenue chart in our October call, and you would have seen on there a 6% growth in our compound annual growth rate and our sustainment costs over the period. So to me, personally, that says a lot to the amount of aggressive cost takeout that\u2019s being embedded by all the actions Jim talked about.\nJim Taiclet: And we did move it up with the joint program office to a five-year PBL response. So, that\u2019s where we\u2019re standing today.\nOperator: Our next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDoug Harned: I wanted to go -- just continue on the F-35. Right now, when we think of production rates, at one time, we were looking at a peak level of about 220 per year. That\u2019s steadily come down to the 156 peak level that we\u2019re looking at now, and we\u2019ve seen some U.S. rate plans come down as well in budgeting. But at the same time, you\u2019ve seen some new international opportunities, Finland being one of them. What risks do you see to the 156 level as a plateau level? And how do you expect the mix to progress between U.S. and international over time?\nJohn Mollard: Yes. So, I\u2019ll take a shot at that one, Doug. I mean just the broad pattern is the U.S. program of record is over 2,400 aircraft. I can\u2019t remember if it\u2019s 2,430 or 2,450 or whatever. But then, we anticipate another, call it, 900 international aircraft. So, the total program by program of record is in excess of 3,300 aircraft. So, when we look at that and we look at the production flow and we think about when will we get -- Finland is probably the most current contract or approach or campaign that we think we\u2019ll get under contract most quickly and then Switzerland, and you\u2019ve got opportunities in Canada as well as a number of other campaigns. In looking at the data, the 156 aircraft production rate, I would think, if anything, has bias to the upside. I mean, the reason for picking the 156 is the last thing you want is a sawtooth production pattern where you\u2019re ramping up and ramping down. So between us and the joint program office, we set a rate that we\u2019re fairly comfortable will result in a level-loaded production build tempo for the foreseeable future.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. And Doug, it\u2019s Jim. Just as I think everyone on this call understands, you have to invest in the capital base for your peak of the sawtooth production schedule. And then you\u2019ve got overcapacity in those years where the sawtooth trends down, and then you might have to recover and invest even more to bring it back up. So between the services and JPO and us, I was literally in on this conversation myself because I understand the needs of the Air Force and Marines and Navy as well as the production system that steady and reliable 156 a year was the right investment level for government and for Lockheed Martin and our supply base over time. So, I agree with John that the bias could be to the upside, especially if we win more of the international opportunities. But, I don\u2019t see a lot of downside risk to it. And the last thing I\u2019ll touch on, because you\u2019ve actually taken a deep dive into this, Doug, and I appreciate you taking time to do that in the past. We\u2019re getting more interest in our sort of technology acceleration concepts to bring digital world technologies into the defense enterprise. And in the aerospace domain, the F-35 is not only the logical, it\u2019s the essential cornerstone of actually doing that. Because the aircraft, especially with the Tech Release 3 and the Block 4 capabilities that John mentioned are coming, will have, by far, the highest data storage level, the highest data processing capability; and with our 5G.MIL approach, the most comprehensive connectivities of the cloud, both dedicated and commercial, to really make it even more attractive. So I do see if there\u2019s a bias to anything to be on the upside as this other element of the F-35 becomes increasingly important, its capability to be an edge node and an integrated system.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. It looks like one of the biggest benefits to the cash flow this quarter was like a $2 billion decline in contract assets. So, if you could discuss that. And obviously, it doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s a onetime benefit because the strong cash flow this year didn\u2019t affect your \u201822 and \u201823 guidance. So, if you comment on that. And then, one other, in RMS, you\u2019ve got declining sales and a declining margin projected for this year. Is that mostly due to Sikorsky where government helicopters come down and development programs like the 53 grow? Thanks.\nJohn Mollard: Yes. Thanks, George. I\u2019ll take both of those questions. And as it -- as usual, your analysis is right on. I\u2019ll start with the last question in and around RMS. Yes, we\u2019re projecting almost a $300 million revenue decline in Black Hawk, the multiyear 9. Obviously, that\u2019s a hot production line, which would tend to have accretive margins. So we\u2019ve got a decline there. We\u2019ve also got an over $300 million ramp in the CH-53K program, as you indicated. And that -- given where we are in that program with a long run runway ahead of it, we -- again, per our typical practice, look at risk retirement events in front of us, make our best engineering estimates of when those events will be achieved. And then, when we achieve them, we record what we would describe the step-ups that you\u2019ll read about. But the two biggest margin factors are exactly what you talked about, decline in the hot production line and a ramp in the CH-53K. So, for the three-year guide, yes, the contract assets you just saw were specifically what you and I would call accounts receivable back in the day. Just to give you some perspective, in the last 3 weeks of 2021, we collected $6 billion in the last 3 weeks. I mean there were 2 weeks where we were over $2 billion. I\u2019ll tell you, when we talked about our operating cash flow guidance in October, there were several very large domestic and international collection events that we\u2019re absolutely not tracking to collect in 2021. I kind of talked about this in the script. We came together as a cross-functional team and made a number of changes in both our internal approach and in our customer outreach activity. And those changes resulted in us collecting not only all those high-risk invoices, but we were also able to bring in a lot of collections that I absolutely would have thought, no way those collections are going to be collected in 2021, and they were. So to your point about, hey, this must not have come out of \u201822 because you\u2019re maintaining your guidance. I\u2019ll say, so while accelerating the collections from 2022 into 2021 drove the outperformance in the fourth quarter and in 2021, I\u2019m really confident that the process and the focus that we applied in the fourth quarter is repeatable, like every year, \u201822, \u201823, \u201824. And as a result, I\u2019m comfortable that we can still generate the prior guide for \u201822 and \u201823, despite the outperformance.\nOperator: Next, we go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: Jim, what\u2019s your take on the adaptive cycle engines as applied to the F-35? If you look at what GE is saying, they suggest that it could give the aircraft maybe 30% more range. And if indeed that\u2019s the case, does that open up the market for the airplane?\nJim Taiclet: So Ron, I actually had the opportunity to visit both engine plants in the last couple of months, Middletown for Pratt & Whitney and Evendale for GE. To their credit, both companies are investing great talent and resources in improving engine options for the F-35. So, there\u2019s one road that the government customers can take, which is improving the existing basic engine design. And there\u2019s a second road they could take, which is a clean sheet engine design that you identify it correctly. It\u2019s called adaptive cycle engine, right? So, I\u2019ve been around this earlier in my career, so I find it interesting. But the difference between the adaptive cycle engine and the upgraded existing engine technology is that rather than two streams of airflow going through the engine, it\u2019s divided into three streams with some fairly sophisticated veins and control mechanisms and feedback throughout the engine. Both potential engine vendors are developing that second technology that I\u2019m talking about, the adaptive cycle or three-airflow-type engine. And it\u2019s really just now up to the Joint Program Office and the Services and Department of Defense writ large to work with us and figure out, well, will the improved engine technology be a viable option for the future based on the threat? So, the threat is evolving. The aircraft has to improve. As you said, if it does improve, it has a wider use case for the U.S. and other nations. And it really will be a U.S. government decision as to based on the threat they\u2019re facing and their assessment of it and our input on what the aircraft needs to do to meet it, they will make an engine decision on one of those two roads, improve what\u2019s there today or go for an entire new technology, which is that three-stream airflow engine.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMike Maugeri: Jim, you talked about some of the higher ad spend going towards 5G.MIL. So, I\u2019m just wondering, are there any guideposts or signs that you\u2019d point to that 5G.MIL is beginning to gain traction as you envision it? I guess, anything looking out that we as the investment community can measure you against?\nJim Taiclet: So Mike, a lot of this is really what we call a keep-sold effort, right? 5G.MIL is designed to, first of all, give our customers more efficient higher level of performance in missions that they\u2019re trying to accomplish. So, one of those missions that we\u2019ve modeled pretty deeply is called counter air, for example. The second one is surface warfare and a third one is integrated air and missile defense. We modeled those at a staff level in great detail with both Lockheed Martin and other OEM platforms contributing to those missions in an accelerated fashion and the new platforms coming on board to further enhance that mission capability. That\u2019s a whole different way of looking at things than the defense industrial base has used in the past, in my view. And frankly, it may be different than our customers and their procurement systems have looked at it. We typically respond to RFPs as we just talked about, where government officials determine a need. They write up a detailed document to distribute to industry who can meet that need, and then we kind of individually respond with our own proposals. What we\u2019re trying to do is adopt the tech industry\u2019s practice of, what\u2019s the mission we\u2019re trying to accomplish? Is it autonomous cars at scale? Is it drone package deliveries? And then figure out what existing vehicles and platforms and systems we have that can contribute that mission and what new ones do we need to develop. But at the same time, we can upgrade that mission every 6 to 12 months. And that\u2019s what 5G.MIL is designed to do. It\u2019s designed to figure out how to not have to wait six years for the next NGAD platform but rather how do we integrate platforms we have today, while that NGAD is being developed over that period of time, increase our capability every 6 to 12 months. So, what 5G.MIL will do will help keep-sold a lot of Lockheed Martin platforms because we\u2019re going to endeavor to put those capabilities on our platforms first to be a pathfinder so we get other OEMs to play with us and create a common standard set and actually have them contribute to that mission profile too. So, very complicated answer to a simple question. You\u2019ll see it as perhaps the program or record of F-35, either to stay -- maintains or increases. You\u2019ll see as we start linking in, hey, perhaps Future Vertical Lift will be a hopefully decision criteria because we\u2019re going to enable that with 5G.MIL to connect to other assets. So, that\u2019s where you\u2019re going to see it. There may not necessarily be another affordable unit or something that comes along the way that says 5G.MIL x billion. It\u2019s going to come in many ways through our existing platforms predominantly. And over time, we\u2019ll hope to license some of these technologies to others and get some income that way. But this is really a keep-sold to drive the Lockheed Martin platform base forward and make the other platforms that we\u2019re developing prospectively for our customers enabled already with that in the design phase and make them more attractive too. That\u2019s really why we\u2019re doing this.\nOperator: Next question is from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Jim, we\u2019re, I think, more than three years removed from when you and the DoD open negotiations on Lot 15 on the F-35. The backlog of F-35 is actually below where it ended 2017. And I know you\u2019re being incrementally funded for Lot 15 and beyond, but why isn\u2019t job number one to close that contract and to sort of get on the right foot with the contract closures and getting them into the backlog?\nJim Taiclet: I\u2019ll let John address this because he\u2019s been around for the entire three-year period.\nJohn Mollard: Yes.\nJim Taiclet: I could add some color at the end, maybe.\nJohn Mollard: Yes. Myles, yes, as you mentioned, we\u2019re still in negotiations with the Joint Program Office on Lots 15 to 17. It has proven more difficult than we expected to reach agreement on a cost baseline that incorporates the impacts that we see associated with our customer set ordering fewer aircraft in Lots 15 to 17 than were ordered in the prior buys of 12 to 14. They\u2019re also -- we\u2019re struggling to come to mutual agreement on the impact of global challenges that Lockheed Martin and our supply chain partners are experiencing, such as inflation and COVID-19. I\u2019ll say we\u2019ll continue using a data-driven process for as long as it takes to reach agreement based on what it\u2019s actually going to cost to build these aircraft. So that said, both parties continue good faith negotiations and are diligently working to reach closure because we both recognize the importance of continuing to deliver these critical F-35 capabilities to the services and to our international partners.\nJim Taiclet: So, Myles, we\u2019re sticking to our economics and trying to make sure that our shareholders get appropriate agreement on their behalf negotiated by our team, and we continue to strive to do that.\nOperator: And next, we\u2019ll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: John, with regard to the R&D cash tax item, I just want to make sure I have it clear. Are you saying that you now know you only need to incorporate IRAD into that, or are you saying that there\u2019s historically, where you placed R&D tax credit will be what has to be amortized going forward? I just want to make sure I have that right. And then, Jim, on a completely different topic, in the near term here, we\u2019re going to get the next budget request and a multiyear look from the Pentagon. Curious if you could just spend a minute on what kind of growth rates you expect to see. I mean there\u2019s a lot of competing interests. And do you think it\u2019s a realistic next five-year framework to think about where the \u201822 budget started with something squarely low single digit or where the \u201822 budget ended something squarely mid-single digit?\nJohn Mollard: Yes.\nJim Taiclet: John, why don\u2019t you do the R&D tax first and I\u2019ll...\nJohn Mollard: Yes. Hey, Noah, to answer your question, the framework we\u2019re looking at for what expenses ought to be capitalized for purposes of this R&D activity, it\u2019s broader than just IR&D but it\u2019s not as broad as the definition that we were using previously. And it is consistent, like I said in the scripted remarks, with the framework we\u2019re using when we calculate the R&D activity we\u2019re doing that merits the R&D tax credit provision. So, it\u2019s historically consistent with that approach.\nJim Taiclet: Okay. And then, on the Future Year Defense Plan or FYDP, F-Y-D-P, that is being developed in the first sort of real year of that forward-looking approach is 2023. It\u2019s too soon to know what the percentage growth rates in the defense budget are going to be. But our expectation will be that FY22, which we\u2019re already, again, a third of the way through, but it looks like a $740 billion number would be the base line upon which 2023 growth would be placed. And then that growth percentage, of course, is going to have to come through the administration and Congress. But if you look at -- and it\u2019s evident each day that goes by. If you look at the evolving threat level and the approach that some countries are taking, including North Korea, Iran and through some of its proxies in Yemen and elsewhere, and especially Russia today, these days, and China, there\u2019s renewed great power competition that does include national defense and threats to it. And the history of United States is when those environments evolve that we do not sit by and just watch it happen. So, I can\u2019t talk to a number, but I do think and I\u2019m concerned personally that the threat is advancing, and we need to be able to meet it. And the contribution we can make at LM is to increase the efficiency and the reliability of our products that we have today for our customer. And secondly, to try to bring this 21st century digital technology to the enterprise in a way that allows us to keep up with the adversaries while we\u2019re developing even newer and more advanced systems.\nGreg Gardner: Hey John, this is Greg. We\u2019ve gone a little over the hour. So I think we\u2019ve come up on the end of our call. I will turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. Thanks, Greg. I\u2019d like to conclude the call by thanking the entire Lockheed Martin community for their steadfast commitment and a really challenging year for supporting our customers and each other. And we\u2019re all going to work to put the pandemic hopefully behind us here in \u201822. I\u2019m confident in our future because the outstanding integrity and performance and innovation of our workforce, and we\u2019ve got like 60,000 engineers and scientists working every day to try to address these issues. And we\u2019ll continue to support our customers and their essential missions that we just talked about. And look, I also appreciate our investors\u2019 confidence in our capability to execute on our long-term free cash flow per share growth strategy. And thanks again to all of you then for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you in April. Bye, everybody. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. And I hope you've had a good start to the New Year. Thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2021 earnings call as we review our results, key business area accomplishments and our outlook for 2022. I'll begin with an update regarding our proposed acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings. As disclosed in our earnings release this morning, we thought it highly likely that the FTC would sue to block the transaction. Since that time, we have received notification from the FTC that they have, in fact, authorized filing a lawsuit. We will review the lawsuit and evaluate all of our options. With the filing of the suit, we may elect to defend the lawsuit or terminate the merger agreement. Moving on to our financial results. In a few minutes, John will discuss our financials in detail and provide our outlook for 2022. But I first would like to begin with a few highlights from the quarter and the year. In October, after we concluded our financial planning process, we established an updated forecast for 2021, which we achieved or exceeded. We met our $67 billion sales forecast, and our segment operating profit and earnings per share both exceeded our projections. Our cash from operations was exceptionally strong, over $9.2 billion, supporting our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process. During the year, we made significant investments in our signature platforms and systems as well as emerging technologies, all to meet the rapidly evolving challenges, as we see every day in the news now, the challenges that our customers are facing and to support future growth for the benefit of our shareholders. Moreover, we continue reshaping and modernizing our operations to increase efficiencies and reduce costs so we can deliver affordable solutions for our customers going forward as well. During 2021, we spent $1.5 billion on independent research and development, a new high watermark for the Company. Notable areas of our IR&D efforts included hypersonics, directed energy and artificial intelligence. We also initiated the development of mission-based technology roadmaps and advanced our 5G.MIL architecture to truly enable joint all-domain operations across multiple platforms, U.S. military services and allies. These investments position the Company to meet our customers' most critical needs well into the future. During the year, we also spent $1.5 billion on capital expenditures, focused on addressing customers' program requirements and supporting our organic growth outlook. Significant capital projects included the introduction of three new state-of-the-art factories of the future, additional adoption of cutting-edge software and hardware solutions to enable model-based engineering throughout the Company, and the establishment of production facilities to support our key hypersonics program. During the fourth quarter, we brought many of these elements together for the opening of an intelligent advanced hypersonic strike production facility in Courtland, Alabama, supporting both our Missiles and Fire Control and Space hypersonic programs. This facility integrates critical digital transformation advancements such as robotic thermal protection capabilities into our manufacturing operations and represents our long-term investment in this critical technology. The Courtland facility joins our new spacecraft Test Assembly and Resource Center in Titusville, Florida and our recently opened 215,000 square-foot advanced manufacturing facility in our Skunk Works organization in Palmdale, California. Together, these facilities add to our intelligent factory framework, digitally linking sites and assets across the enterprise to speed production, provide cost efficiencies and drive future margin improvements throughout the Company. From a capital return perspective, during the quarter, we executed a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase program and thereby retired nearly 6 million shares under that agreement. This brought our total 2021 repurchase amount to over $4 billion, which when coupled with our strong dividend payments resulted in a total of $7 billion of cash returned to our shareholders during the year. We will continue to be opportunistic with share repurchases and expect to utilize our remaining $4 billion authorization in 2022. I'll now touch briefly on the Department of Defense budgets. This quarter, Congress passed the fiscal year 2022 National Defense Authorization Act with strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate. The NDAA policy bill was subsequently signed into law by President Biden. This legislation authorizes a $25 billion increase for the Department of Defense for a total of approximately $740 billion for defense programs and raised the investment accounts approximately 8% above the President's originally requested amounts. Currently, the DoD is operating under a continuing resolution through February 18th for FY 2022. As Congress continues the appropriations process, we believe our programs are well supported, reflecting the fact that our portfolio is aligned with affordably delivering our customers' national security capabilities. Now -- turning now to our growth strategy. Last quarter, we discussed our long-term expectations, which anticipate that our sales will increase by approximately 2% in 2023 with steadily increasing sales growth through 2026. As we discussed in October, the four primary areas that underpin this longer-term growth forecast are programs of record, classified activities, hypersonics and new business awards. Expansion in our program of records is a clear key pillar of our long-term growth strategy. In this quarter, we are pleased to see two new customers select our signature programs to support their national security objectives. Last month, the government of Finland selected the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter as the winning entry in their HX Fighter Program competition, citing the aircraft's affordability as well as its combat, reconnaissance and survival capabilities is best suited to deliver on the HX requirements. This announcement for 64 conventional takeoff and landing stealth fighters has a potential contract value of over $9 billion and follows Switzerland's decision to purchase 36 F-35s. These announcements highlight the momentum that is building in this program with future international opportunities in Canada and elsewhere to go in front of us. Our Rotary and Mission Systems team also secured an important international opportunity this past quarter as the Israeli Air Force signed a letter of acceptance with the United States government to pursue the Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter. This agreement enables the Israeli Air Force to procure 12 53Ks with the option to buy another half dozen. If fully exercised, those options could exceed $2 billion in value. Israel then be our first international CH-53K customer as they look to replace their current fleet of legacy Sikorsky CH-53 helicopters, which have been flying over 50 years. Another pillar of our long-term growth strategy, our classified activities, also saw momentum build in the fourth quarter. Our Space business area was awarded a contract by the U.S. Air Force to develop and classify -- fly a prototype RF payloads in space. Our solution leverages ongoing internal investments on our LM 400 satellite bus, providing greater mission flexibility and longer-duration orbit life. This award for initial engineering contract includes options to deliver an operational system with the potential for this to grow into a new franchise program down the road. And on a final note, 2021 presented a challenging environment for both commercial and defense industries, especially in terms of continuing COVID-19 effects and supply chain impacts. Our teams in all 4 Lockheed Martin business areas and across our corporate functions banded together and did a tremendous job maintaining our production operations and advancing science and engineering on behalf of our customers. I'm extremely proud of the perseverance and dedication of our entire organization, and I know that as One Lockheed Martin, we're going to drive future growth into our business and advance our vision to accelerate 21st Century Digital World Technologies into our national defense enterprise. And with that, I'll turn the call over to John and join you later to answer your questions. So, Peter, our merger agreement with Aerojet Rocketdyne allows for a 30-day period post filing of a lawsuit to make that decision of either defend or terminate the agreement. So, we'll be working with our Board over the next few days and weeks to make that determination. Well, of course, I mean, it's a great opportunity actually with your question, Peter, to speak to what John and I have been talking about here, disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process. So basically, we array and assess all the alternative uses of capital and through a lens of what's the most beneficial for the shareholder, what's the best long-term ROI for that dollar of cash flow. And we look at the array of IR&D CapEx that I just talked about. Last year, it was about $3 billion in total. We made those investments because we think for organic or new business growth, they're going to have great ROIs and they're going to get the first call on our investment. But we don't have an unlimited set of opportunities, so to speak, in either R&D or CapEx. So, it's bounded. So then we look at inorganic growth opportunities, which could be M&A, joint ventures, et cetera. Those that are available are not necessarily expansive right now, let's say. And so, then that leads you then to share repurchase and dividend growth, which is where the bulk of our funds are going these days, as you've heard from John. So, it's dynamic and disciplined. That's what we mean by it is we're going to look across all those opportunity sets, look for the best ROI for the shareholder down the road, and then we're going to allocate that capital there. And we don't need to grow our cash balance. We have upside, I'd say, on leverage, should we choose to take it down the road. So, you're going to see us continue to allocate capital in that way. So, we're not just going to sit back and say, well, whether AJRD goes through or not, we're just going to sort of sit back on our capital and let it grow in the cash count. We're going to keep allocating it dynamically to the most and best how it's used. Sure. So, I'll start off, it's Jim here, and then turn it over to John. So it really was encouraging what Congress came out with in the NDAA. From a program perspective, it was excellent for the Company, 9 additional Black Hawks, 2 additional CH-53K in the NDAA, 4 additional C-130Js and 12 more that interceptors. And beyond that, there was increased funding for some of our tactical and strike missile programs as well. So really solid literally across the Company impact of the NDAA. We're assuming that the continuing resolution does get resolved at some point by September 31, 2022. And the impact of that NDAA, and hopefully the defense budget appropriation coming along with it, will be really to build the pipeline of future revenue for us. It's -- given there's only sort of 7 or 8 months in the fiscal year left in the first place, we have most of our revenue visibility already in process of production orders and deliveries. So John, I'll give it back to you. But basically, it's -- those plus ups are longer-term value creators for us and the shareholder, not necessarily going to hit meaningfully in the next, say, six to seven months. Yes. Good morning, Kristine. I've just returned a couple of weeks ago from opening up that Courtland facility in Alabama. And two of our, I guess, marquee programs and those that are perhaps among the furthest along, in fact, three programs are going to be produced there. And I'll just mention them really briefly. It's a complicated set of systems. But a couple to keep in mind are what the Navy calls Conventional Prompt Strike or CPS. That's a hypersonic missile of some size that has very good range and will be launched from submarines and ultimately from destroyer-type shifts. In concert with the development of that strike product, the Army has teamed up with the Navy, which is somewhat innovative and novel for them, for what they call the Long-Range Hypersonics Weapon program, so LRHW. The Army intends to use a very similar missile but launch from ground units through what's called a TEL. TEL stands for Transporter Erector Launcher. We've already delivered the first training unit of that TEL to the Army. So, they're working with that today. The missiles will be produced in the Courtland factory over the next few years. And we'll be serving the Navy and the Army from there. The third product that we intend to produce in the Courtland facility is for the Air Force, and that's called ARRW or A-R-R-W, so Advanced Rapid Response Weapon. That's an air-launched missile that travels with hypersonic speeds, and we're testing those at Edwards Air Force base now on B-52 bombers as the carriers there. So we're going through test events in that program with the Air Force. And over the next couple of years, we hope to be making the production runs on those as well. So, that's the summary. Again, there's more to the story, but I think those are the highlights, CPS, the advanced air-launched weapon and then the long-range hypersonics for the Army. And Rich, I'd just summarize all that by saying we think the bow wave has passed in supply chain disruption for Lockheed Martin, but we're still watching it closely. And as John just said, not all the risk is out of the system yet. Yes. I think we made great progress over the past year by really bringing attention and integration between the joint program office, these key services that fly the airplane and Lockheed Martin and actually Pratt & Whitney also is the suppliers. So, we've all joined together in a way that I think might even be unprecedented in that we all realize we have a shared goal to reduce the cost per flight hour and improve the readiness rate of the jet. And we're all working together to do that. So, we've had some successes where we've got long lead time spare part orders already through the system, and that will help with having enough spare parts in the right places at the right time to reduce costs and improve the readiness rate. We've also received a request for proposal for somewhat more limited, but nonetheless, a PBL or performance-based logistics program that we, again, together agreed, let's really focus on the supply chain side of that, which you can integrate with production parts planning and sustainment parts planning. You always want to -- if you can keep those together. That's where this PBL is largely focused, less so on sort of the labor piece of it, which we'll figure out as we go with the government, what happens in our supply chain, what happens at Lockheed Martin, what happens in depots. But the bulk of the value will be in the parts flow, distribution, production integration, et cetera. That is, I think, a three-year PBL. We hope to get that negotiated over the next coming months or quarters, if you will. So, I think, we're really well on the road to having a much more coherent and integrated industry customer program office approach to sustainment. And we've already got good progress in getting some of the cost per hour down even as we speak. And we did move it up with the joint program office to a five-year PBL response. So, that's where we're standing today. Yes. And Doug, it's Jim. Just as I think everyone on this call understands, you have to invest in the capital base for your peak of the sawtooth production schedule. And then you've got overcapacity in those years where the sawtooth trends down, and then you might have to recover and invest even more to bring it back up. So between the services and JPO and us, I was literally in on this conversation myself because I understand the needs of the Air Force and Marines and Navy as well as the production system that steady and reliable 156 a year was the right investment level for government and for Lockheed Martin and our supply base over time. So, I agree with John that the bias could be to the upside, especially if we win more of the international opportunities. But, I don't see a lot of downside risk to it. And the last thing I'll touch on, because you've actually taken a deep dive into this, Doug, and I appreciate you taking time to do that in the past. We're getting more interest in our sort of technology acceleration concepts to bring digital world technologies into the defense enterprise. And in the aerospace domain, the F-35 is not only the logical, it's the essential cornerstone of actually doing that. Because the aircraft, especially with the Tech Release 3 and the Block 4 capabilities that John mentioned are coming, will have, by far, the highest data storage level, the highest data processing capability; and with our 5G.MIL approach, the most comprehensive connectivities of the cloud, both dedicated and commercial, to really make it even more attractive. So I do see if there's a bias to anything to be on the upside as this other element of the F-35 becomes increasingly important, its capability to be an edge node and an integrated system. So Ron, I actually had the opportunity to visit both engine plants in the last couple of months, Middletown for Pratt & Whitney and Evendale for GE. To their credit, both companies are investing great talent and resources in improving engine options for the F-35. So, there's one road that the government customers can take, which is improving the existing basic engine design. And there's a second road they could take, which is a clean sheet engine design that you identify it correctly. It's called adaptive cycle engine, right? So, I've been around this earlier in my career, so I find it interesting. But the difference between the adaptive cycle engine and the upgraded existing engine technology is that rather than two streams of airflow going through the engine, it's divided into three streams with some fairly sophisticated veins and control mechanisms and feedback throughout the engine. Both potential engine vendors are developing that second technology that I'm talking about, the adaptive cycle or three-airflow-type engine. And it's really just now up to the Joint Program Office and the Services and Department of Defense writ large to work with us and figure out, well, will the improved engine technology be a viable option for the future based on the threat? So, the threat is evolving. The aircraft has to improve. As you said, if it does improve, it has a wider use case for the U.S. and other nations. And it really will be a U.S. government decision as to based on the threat they're facing and their assessment of it and our input on what the aircraft needs to do to meet it, they will make an engine decision on one of those two roads, improve what's there today or go for an entire new technology, which is that three-stream airflow engine. So Mike, a lot of this is really what we call a keep-sold effort, right? 5G.MIL is designed to, first of all, give our customers more efficient higher level of performance in missions that they're trying to accomplish. So, one of those missions that we've modeled pretty deeply is called counter air, for example. The second one is surface warfare and a third one is integrated air and missile defense. We modeled those at a staff level in great detail with both Lockheed Martin and other OEM platforms contributing to those missions in an accelerated fashion and the new platforms coming on board to further enhance that mission capability. That's a whole different way of looking at things than the defense industrial base has used in the past, in my view. And frankly, it may be different than our customers and their procurement systems have looked at it. We typically respond to RFPs as we just talked about, where government officials determine a need. They write up a detailed document to distribute to industry who can meet that need, and then we kind of individually respond with our own proposals. What we're trying to do is adopt the tech industry's practice of, what's the mission we're trying to accomplish? Is it autonomous cars at scale? Is it drone package deliveries? And then figure out what existing vehicles and platforms and systems we have that can contribute that mission and what new ones do we need to develop. But at the same time, we can upgrade that mission every 6 to 12 months. And that's what 5G.MIL is designed to do. It's designed to figure out how to not have to wait six years for the next NGAD platform but rather how do we integrate platforms we have today, while that NGAD is being developed over that period of time, increase our capability every 6 to 12 months. So, what 5G.MIL will do will help keep-sold a lot of Lockheed Martin platforms because we're going to endeavor to put those capabilities on our platforms first to be a pathfinder so we get other OEMs to play with us and create a common standard set and actually have them contribute to that mission profile too. So, very complicated answer to a simple question. You'll see it as perhaps the program or record of F-35, either to stay -- maintains or increases. You'll see as we start linking in, hey, perhaps Future Vertical Lift will be a hopefully decision criteria because we're going to enable that with 5G.MIL to connect to other assets. So, that's where you're going to see it. There may not necessarily be another affordable unit or something that comes along the way that says 5G.MIL x billion. It's going to come in many ways through our existing platforms predominantly. And over time, we'll hope to license some of these technologies to others and get some income that way. But this is really a keep-sold to drive the Lockheed Martin platform base forward and make the other platforms that we're developing prospectively for our customers enabled already with that in the design phase and make them more attractive too. That's really why we're doing this. I'll let John address this because he's been around for the entire three-year period. I could add some color at the end, maybe. So, Myles, we're sticking to our economics and trying to make sure that our shareholders get appropriate agreement on their behalf negotiated by our team, and we continue to strive to do that. John, why don't you do the R&D tax first and I'll... Okay. And then, on the Future Year Defense Plan or FYDP, F-Y-D-P, that is being developed in the first sort of real year of that forward-looking approach is 2023. It's too soon to know what the percentage growth rates in the defense budget are going to be. But our expectation will be that FY22, which we're already, again, a third of the way through, but it looks like a $740 billion number would be the base line upon which 2023 growth would be placed. And then that growth percentage, of course, is going to have to come through the administration and Congress. But if you look at -- and it's evident each day that goes by. If you look at the evolving threat level and the approach that some countries are taking, including North Korea, Iran and through some of its proxies in Yemen and elsewhere, and especially Russia today, these days, and China, there's renewed great power competition that does include national defense and threats to it. And the history of United States is when those environments evolve that we do not sit by and just watch it happen. So, I can't talk to a number, but I do think and I'm concerned personally that the threat is advancing, and we need to be able to meet it. And the contribution we can make at LM is to increase the efficiency and the reliability of our products that we have today for our customer. And secondly, to try to bring this 21st century digital technology to the enterprise in a way that allows us to keep up with the adversaries while we're developing even newer and more advanced systems. Yes. Thanks, Greg. I'd like to conclude the call by thanking the entire Lockheed Martin community for their steadfast commitment and a really challenging year for supporting our customers and each other. And we're all going to work to put the pandemic hopefully behind us here in \u201822. I'm confident in our future because the outstanding integrity and performance and innovation of our workforce, and we've got like 60,000 engineers and scientists working every day to try to address these issues. And we'll continue to support our customers and their essential missions that we just talked about. And look, I also appreciate our investors' confidence in our capability to execute on our long-term free cash flow per share growth strategy. And thanks again to all of you then for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you in April. Bye, everybody. Take care."

            "name": "John Mollard",
            "content": "All right. Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we've included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of 2021 results. Starting with sales, we recorded revenue of $67 billion, which was consistent with the guidance we provided in October. This record level of sales was made possible by an exceptionally strong fourth quarter of delivering affordable, relevant solutions to our customers. Additionally, our segment operating profit of $7.4 billion and earnings per share of $22.76 exceeded our October projections, driven by strong operational performance across the entire portfolio. We generated more than $9.2 billion in operating cash flow this year. And as we discussed last quarter, we are committed to a strategy of disciplined and dynamic capital allocation. We continue reshaping our operations and identifying ways we can increase efficiencies and reduce costs. As Jim mentioned, we invested $3 billion in research and development and capital expenditures to help our customers achieve their missions and to drive organic growth. In addition to this internal reinvestment, we repurchased over $4 billion of shares in 2021, including $2.1 billion in the fourth quarter. Combined with increased annual dividend payments of approximately $3 billion, we returned just over $7 billion to shareholders. Looking forward, our outlook for 2022 remains consistent with our October trending information as we build our foundation for growth in 2023 and beyond. Turning to chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales and segment operating profit both increased 3% compared to 2020 results and represent high watermarks for the Company. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the year. Our full year earnings per share of $22.76 incorporates the $4.72 noncash charge associated with the $4.9 billion pension liability transfer that we completed during the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, our pre-transaction EPS of $27.48 was 12% higher than our 2020 results due to increased volume and improved segment operating margin, gains in our Lockheed Martin Ventures portfolio, increased FAS/CAS pension income, and a reduction in share count. On chart 6, we look at our full year cash generation and deployment. 2021 cash performance was outstanding as we generated over $9.2 billion in operating cash flow and $7.7 billion in free cash flow. We returned 91% of this free cash flow to our shareholders through increased share repurchases and dividends. Our remaining share repurchase authority is approximately $4 billion, and we expect to opportunistically deploy that entire amount in 2022. Moving on to chart 7 and our 2022 guidance. Consistent with our October trading information, we estimate 2022 sales at approximately $66 billion and segment operating profit of approximately $7.2 billion, resulting in a segment operating margin of 10.9%. FAS/CAS pension income is projected at $2.26 billion, which is $60 million higher than the $2.2 billion estimate we provided in October. We are projecting earnings per share of $26.70, and our estimate for 2022 cash from operations remains at greater than or equal to $8.4 billion, excluding the impacts of the R&D capitalization tax law change, which we now estimate at approximately $500 million. I should mention, there is still a possibility that legislation will be enacted that defers or refuels the requirement to capitalize R&D expenditures from a tax payment perspective, but we are including the impact of higher tax payments in our current outlook as we will be required to make these payments unless existing law is amended by legislation. On chart 8, we show our updated three-year forecast for cash generation. Our outstanding fourth quarter cash flow was driven by a tightly coordinated collections process across all business areas and functional support organizations, leading to exceptional collection results from both domestic and international customers. Partially offsetting this upside was an increase of $700 million in accelerated payments we made to our supply chain during the fourth quarter. With the emergence of the Omicron variant and surges in COVID cases, we increased total accelerated payments to over $2.2 billion at year-end and our continuing effort to mitigate supply chain risk. Our outstanding collection performance and the increase in accelerated payments to our supply chain partners resulted in our generating $9.2 billion in cash from operations and $7.7 billion in free cash flow. Over the three-year period from 2021 through 2023 and before considering the potential impacts of R&D capitalization, we now project total cash from operations of greater than or equal to $26.1 billion, which is $900 million higher than our prior estimate. This increase was driven by our fourth quarter results and our expectation that we will maintain this extremely high level of performance throughout the forecast period. Generating over $25 billion in operating cash flow after incorporating the potential $900 million impact of R&D capitalization provides significant support for our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation strategy. On chart 9, we break out our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business areas. Our estimates for the year remain consistent with the trending information we provided in October as we focus on long-term growth opportunities and building on the strong operational results we delivered in the fourth quarter. And on chart 10 to summarize, we successfully closed out 2021 with all metrics equal to or better than the guidance we provided in October, highlighted by exceptional cash generation. With our strong balance sheet and our demonstrated ability to generate high levels of operating cash flow, we are well-positioned to execute on our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation strategy for years to come. I'm excited about our opportunities in 2022 as we deliver mission capabilities for our customers and long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A. And cash deployment? Yes. And just to put a point on the CR impact, it would take pretty much a full year CR to have any sort of impact on our revenue that you would see. The biggest impact will be to our customers' ability to prosecute their missions, especially in program areas where requirements would have us on a trajectory to grow. And obviously, with the CR, you're not able to grow program requirements. So absent a full year CR, I would anticipate relatively de minimis impact on the forecast we've given. And I think your -- next question was around the change in the R&D tax payment assumption. I think last -- historically, we've talked about a number of $2 billion. I think last quarter, it was probably a little more subtle than you would have thought. We've kind of changed the definition to say, \"Hey, we could see up to $2 billion.\" I'll start by saying there's still a possibility that legislation is going to get enacted that will end up in this getting deferred or repealed, and I said that in the script. But given the number one vehicle to have that done is the President build back better legislation and given where that is, the path to enactment remains unclear right now. But we do, however, believe there's recognition by Congress that legislation is needed to address this critical aspect of R&D activities. It's really not at all consistent with our nation's public policy objectives. Now, specific to the change in the amount from up to $2 billion to the approximately $500 million we've got in our guidance. One of the first reviews I had with our tax team after taking on my current role is to understand the assumptions that were used in calculating that projected impact. I have a bunch of questions about these assumptions, and as 2022 grew closer without any form of legislative action, we refined our analysis and then shared that with external advisors. And what we did -- we concluded that the capitalization provision scope was narrow than what we had originally assumed. We've historically claimed the R&D tax credit on certain activities. And after discussion with our advisors, we determined that the R&D tax credit framework is relevant in establishing the scope of R&D activity that will require capitalization. So, as a result, we've updated our estimated impact to reflect the value that is consistent with the provisions of the tax code. Yes, absolutely. Good question. Probably the two biggest, I'll call them, dilutive impacts on margins in \u201822 is the growth in our classified activity in Skunk Works. These are predominantly very good ROI programs, but their margins that they attract that given the lower financial risk associated with these programs are going to be dilutive. So, we're projecting growth in the Skunk Works operation of roughly $300 million that's coming in. That's going to be dilutive. And then, we've got a lot of growth in our F-16 program, and given where that program is, I mean we're roughly a year out from first deliveries on the F-16 line with the ramp that we're expecting. We're projecting revenue to increase on F-16 roughly $300 million. Given where that program is in its life cycle, we think it's prudent to reflect typically prudent but relatively conservative margins on that growth. And as a result, you're going to see a reduction in margins in 2022 on the F-16 program. Those are probably the two biggest dilutive margin growth areas within Aeronautics. I think longer term, the key to growing margins in Aeronautics is going to be performing on the delivery of the F-35 production program. And that's going to require us to perform on delivering the enhanced capabilities that our customers need that we've talked about a lot in keeping, for example, the TR3 infrastructure upgrade program on track, keeping the mission capability expansions on track. I'm fully confident we will be able to achieve our internal operating metrics. And if we do, there will be upside. And Kristine, this is John. To your question on the long-range guide, I think I'll stick with the $3 billion sort of revenue forecast in 2026. There are opportunities to grow it. As Jim mentioned, there's operational urgencies driving our customers to push us to go faster and faster. There's emerging activity in counter hypersonics that -- maybe of some note that we'll keep an eye on that could provide upside to that forecast. But I think for modeling purposes, I'm comfortable with $3 billion. Yes. Rich, I'll take the first one, and I'll let Jim take the second one. Just in general, as you pointed out, we accelerated substantially more payments to our supply chain during the fourth quarter than we even talked about back in October when at the time, we had $1.5 billion accelerated, and we said that we would anticipate maintaining that level through the year-end. But given the global COVID situation and the ongoing fragility in our supply chain, we decided that increasing the level of accelerated payments to our partners was a prudent risk mitigation strategy. And to your point about, are you hitting your marks, I'll give a lot of credit to our global supply chain leadership team. They've been actively working with all of our suppliers to ensure we're collectively positioned to meet our customer requirements, and that includes like embedding our own Lockheed Martin personnel within their facilities to help with the stresses that they're facing. And as a result, I think a proactive activity by our supply chain leadership team, I was encouraged to see that our fourth quarter supply chain activity was in line with the expectations we set in October, which assumes some level of recovery from October -- from what we saw in the third quarter. But there is still no doubt an overhang on the ability of our supply chain really to pivot to normal changes and requirements. So, I don't think we're all the way out of the woods, but I think we're focused -- we've got laser-like focused from both a management involvement point of view and financial support. On the hypersonic strategy, I'm just going to take AJRD out of the discussion, but I will tell you this. So for us and our customer base, which is basically the three largest military services in the United States, we've all agreed jointly to kind of a go-fast approach to development, which means there's a little more risk in the development sequence, if you will, develop and test, learn the lessons and then redesign. So, we're doing that jointly. And one of the benefits of integrating somewhat vertically with propulsion and what's called the glide body, which is the heat-absorbing part of the missile, and then the full air system that supports the missile either out of the tube or off the airplane. The more you can integrate that engineering organization, probably the faster you could go, but we can manage it as we do today with the propulsion provider outside of Lockheed Martin. So, we'll continue to manage it as we have. We think we could have gotten the speed and efficiency increase by partial vertical integration hypersonics through the AJRD acquisition specifically. But we can still manage it whichever way that deal turns out. Yes. Just to kind of put a quantitative mention on what Jim was talking about. So, at the end of the year of 2021, we had 753 fielded aircraft. And based on the production plan, that number of fielded aircraft is going to grow from 753 to like 1,525 aircraft, which is a 15% compound annual growth rate, and the number of fielded aircraft and the flight hour growth rate even faster. So, you can think of sustainable cost as a function of flight hours. The flight hours are growing over 16%. And I think we gave you a long-term sustainment revenue chart in our October call, and you would have seen on there a 6% growth in our compound annual growth rate and our sustainment costs over the period. So to me, personally, that says a lot to the amount of aggressive cost takeout that's being embedded by all the actions Jim talked about. Yes. So, I'll take a shot at that one, Doug. I mean just the broad pattern is the U.S. program of record is over 2,400 aircraft. I can't remember if it's 2,430 or 2,450 or whatever. But then, we anticipate another, call it, 900 international aircraft. So, the total program by program of record is in excess of 3,300 aircraft. So, when we look at that and we look at the production flow and we think about when will we get -- Finland is probably the most current contract or approach or campaign that we think we'll get under contract most quickly and then Switzerland, and you've got opportunities in Canada as well as a number of other campaigns. In looking at the data, the 156 aircraft production rate, I would think, if anything, has bias to the upside. I mean, the reason for picking the 156 is the last thing you want is a sawtooth production pattern where you're ramping up and ramping down. So between us and the joint program office, we set a rate that we're fairly comfortable will result in a level-loaded production build tempo for the foreseeable future. Yes. Thanks, George. I'll take both of those questions. And as it -- as usual, your analysis is right on. I'll start with the last question in and around RMS. Yes, we're projecting almost a $300 million revenue decline in Black Hawk, the multiyear 9. Obviously, that's a hot production line, which would tend to have accretive margins. So we've got a decline there. We've also got an over $300 million ramp in the CH-53K program, as you indicated. And that -- given where we are in that program with a long run runway ahead of it, we -- again, per our typical practice, look at risk retirement events in front of us, make our best engineering estimates of when those events will be achieved. And then, when we achieve them, we record what we would describe the step-ups that you'll read about. But the two biggest margin factors are exactly what you talked about, decline in the hot production line and a ramp in the CH-53K. So, for the three-year guide, yes, the contract assets you just saw were specifically what you and I would call accounts receivable back in the day. Just to give you some perspective, in the last 3 weeks of 2021, we collected $6 billion in the last 3 weeks. I mean there were 2 weeks where we were over $2 billion. I'll tell you, when we talked about our operating cash flow guidance in October, there were several very large domestic and international collection events that we're absolutely not tracking to collect in 2021. I kind of talked about this in the script. We came together as a cross-functional team and made a number of changes in both our internal approach and in our customer outreach activity. And those changes resulted in us collecting not only all those high-risk invoices, but we were also able to bring in a lot of collections that I absolutely would have thought, no way those collections are going to be collected in 2021, and they were. So to your point about, hey, this must not have come out of \u201822 because you're maintaining your guidance. I'll say, so while accelerating the collections from 2022 into 2021 drove the outperformance in the fourth quarter and in 2021, I'm really confident that the process and the focus that we applied in the fourth quarter is repeatable, like every year, \u201822, \u201823, \u201824. And as a result, I'm comfortable that we can still generate the prior guide for \u201822 and \u201823, despite the outperformance. Yes. Yes. Myles, yes, as you mentioned, we're still in negotiations with the Joint Program Office on Lots 15 to 17. It has proven more difficult than we expected to reach agreement on a cost baseline that incorporates the impacts that we see associated with our customer set ordering fewer aircraft in Lots 15 to 17 than were ordered in the prior buys of 12 to 14. They're also -- we're struggling to come to mutual agreement on the impact of global challenges that Lockheed Martin and our supply chain partners are experiencing, such as inflation and COVID-19. I'll say we'll continue using a data-driven process for as long as it takes to reach agreement based on what it's actually going to cost to build these aircraft. So that said, both parties continue good faith negotiations and are diligently working to reach closure because we both recognize the importance of continuing to deliver these critical F-35 capabilities to the services and to our international partners. Yes. Yes. Hey, Noah, to answer your question, the framework we're looking at for what expenses ought to be capitalized for purposes of this R&D activity, it's broader than just IR&D but it's not as broad as the definition that we were using previously. And it is consistent, like I said in the scripted remarks, with the framework we're using when we calculate the R&D activity we're doing that merits the R&D tax credit provision. So, it's historically consistent with that approach."

With that, I would like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJames Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter, 2021 earnings call. In a few moments, John, will provide a detailed review of our quarterly results, updated 2021 guidance and trending information for 2022. But first I will provide a five-year Sales Outlook and discuss our plans for accelerating capabilities to our customers and driving per-share value to our shareholders over that time horizon.  Last month, I lead our executive leadership team as we completed our annual strategic and financial planning process. Given the scope of changes in our operating environment over the past year, we conducted a more in-depth and extended assessment of our financial forecast. Based on these strategic and financial reviews in the information available to us today, our current expectation is that sales in 2022 will decline slightly from our expected 2021 sales level.  We then anticipate sales will increase slightly in 2023 with steadily increasing sales growth through 2026. This sales trajectory reflects a number of factors, including the continuing effects of the ongoing COVID pandemic and extended delivery timelines across our supply chain, moderating growth rates in the U.S. defense budget, shifts in customer priorities driven by recent events such as the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, and the re-nationalization of the AWE program in the UK. And our recently completed agreement with the F-35 Joint Program Office on a rebase lining of aircraft deliveries under our production program.  I'll address the significant agreement a little later in my remarks. It was all forward projections, our performance on current programs, our ability to wait highly competitive new starts, the size of future defense budgets, and the global geopolitical landscape will all influence our ultimate growth rate over the coming five years. But as we look ahead, there are four primary areas that underpin our longer-term growth forecast. The first of these future growth areas is within our Hypersonics portfolio.  We're currently performing on six Hypersonics programs across the Company, and following the successful completion of ongoing testing and evaluation activity. Multiple programs are expected to enter production between 2023 and 2026. The second growth area is within our classified activity. Three of our four business areas are engaged in significant classified development programs and pending successful achievement of the objectives within those programs. We expect to begin the transition from development to production, again, between 23 and 26.  The third area of expected growth lies in our current programs of record. Our portfolio is very well aligned with our customers mission requirements, and as a result, we have multiple programs from each business area entering growth stages. This includes the CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, F-35 sustainment activity, increased PAC-3 production rates, and the modernization and enhancements to the Fleet Ballistic Missile. And, finally, we're in competition for several significant new business awards, including the future vertical lift, FLRAA and FARA competitions.  The next-generation interceptor program, and the KCY tanker program. These represent meaningful opportunities to accelerate our projected top-line growth profile with new long-term projects that are critical to our national defense. Now I would like to discuss our strategy for driving strong returns for our shareholders in the near term while remaining well positioned for our expected return to growth in 2023. The central tenet of our value creation strategy is using a disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process. We will first reinvest capital into our business to meet our customers requirements and drive organic growth.  Concurrently, we will continue pursuing actionable inorganic growth opportunities that strengthen our core business. And we will return cash to shareholders through increasing dividend payments and a significantly expanded share re-purchase program. To drive sustainable organic growth, we will continue making significant investments in our business area. These investments include nearly $2 billion of annual capital expenditures and approximately $1.5 billion in independent research and development spending each year.  These investments are being made in our signature platforms and systems to provide our customers with the high-value solutions they're going to need to execute their missions of deterring if necessary defeating the pacing threats across all domains of operations. Additionally, we are transforming our internal operations with a model-based engineering and enterprise architecture. And we are building digital factories of the future. These investments and state-of-the-art engineering, manufacturing, and sustainment tools and techniques will ensure our business areas can continue delivering outstanding performance leveled on current programs, while also positioning us to prevail an upcoming campaigns.  After making these significant investments in our business to support our customers, and drive organic growth, we expect to have substantial free cash flows available to return to you, the shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Last month, the board increased our quarterly dividends by $0.20, or approximately 8% to $2.80 per share, and now $11.20 per share annually, providing shareholders, especially our yield investors, with strong returns. This action marks the 20th consecutive year that the board increased Lockheed Martin's quarterly dividend.  Along with making an increased quarterly dividend payment, we will also provide additional value to shareholders by returning excess cash to them through a greatly expanded share repurchase program. As discussed in today's press release, we've already repurchased $2 billion of our shares through the first three quarters of 2021. And last month, on my recommendation, the board increased our remaining share repurchase authority by $5 billion, bringing our current total share repurchase authority to approximately $6 billion. With our stock trading at a level well below what we calculate as the Company's intrinsic value, we have significantly increased our planned share buybacks, and I anticipate that we will repurchase up to $6 billion of our shares over the next 12, 18 months, if conditions warrant.  As a final note on shareholder value, we're going to dynamically allocate capital to the highest return opportunities, prioritizing investments that lead to growing free cash flow per share. That's our new metric. We will remain opportunistic and pursuing accretive bolt-on acquisitions, evaluate additional increases to our current share purchase authorization, and continue to reinvest capital to our business to drive long-term growth. We have the Balance Sheet flexibility and firepower to pursue multiple avenues of growth while returning significant capital to our shareholders.  We built this Balance Sheet to use it and we will do so. Consistent with our focus on long-term shareholders value creation. Our strong Balance Sheet provides us with the capability to close on the Aerojet Rocketdyne transaction, provide robust returns to shareholders and continue to invest in our portfolio to support our customers and drive future growth. The Aerojet Rocketdyne transaction continues moving through the regulatory approval process and we now anticipate closing in the first quarter of 2022.  Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to highlight the efforts of the entire F-35 organization, including the government's Joint Program office, our teammates and suppliers, our Aeronautics Organization, and our international partners for establishing a new aircraft production baseline and delivery profile that will provide industry government, partner countries and FMS customers, as well as you, the investor community, with important visibility well into the future. The program is strong and stable, and we have opportunities ahead of us to add to that strength. The program has delivered over 700 production aircraft out of a plan of record of over 3,300 jets, including to all 3 U.S. services and 9 international customers so far. And we look forward to continuing the successful program for decades to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to John and I'll rejoin you to answer your questions.\nJohn Mollard: Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of third quarter activity. Starting with sales, we recorded revenue of $16 billion. This result was below our expectation as we realized larger than anticipated supply chain impacts across Aeronautics, Missiles, and Fire Control in space. These impacts span multiple suppliers and our expectation is that we will incrementally recover from these disruptions over the next 12-18 months. Despite this reduction in sales volume, our segment operating profit increased year-over-year to $1.9 billion on strong operational performance across the enterprise.  Our earnings per share of $2.21 included a non-cash charge of $4.72 related to our previously announced pension transaction. We generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations and continued our practice of accelerating payment store supply chain with $1.5 billion and accelerated payments at quarter-end. The supply chain disruptions we experienced during the third quarter, underscore the fact that many of our suppliers are still dealing with the financial stress caused by the global pandemic. In addition, we continue to return substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchase activity.  And we have provided trending data for 2022, which we will discuss further in a few minutes. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. As we noted in our earnings release, our third quarter sales are below 2020 levels, primarily because of the re-nationalization of the atomic weapons establishment program in our space business area. Our third quarter sales also reflect recent supply chain delays, most notably on the F-35 production activity, and on several production programs within both Missiles and Fire Control and space.  Despite this reduction in sales volume, our third quarter segment operating profit is up from last year. A strong operational performance resulted in significant risk retirements across all four business areas. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the quarter. Our earnings per share of $2.21 incorporates a $4.72 non-cash charge associated with the $4.9 billion pension liability transfer we completed back in August. On an adjusted basis, our pre -transaction earnings per share of $6.93, was 11% higher than our 2020 results due to improved segment operating margins, reduced share account, and another quarter of mark-to-market gains across our Lockheed Martin Ventures portfolio.  While future volatility associated with investments in early-stage companies is expected, the significant gains realized across multiple holdings in our Ventures portfolio reinforce the value of investing in and partnering with companies focused on cutting-edge technologies. On Chart 6, we will look at our year-to-date cash generation and deployment. Subtracting our capital expenditures from almost $5 billion of cash from operations, our year-to-date free cash flow is greater than $4 billion. We've repurchased $2 billion of shares year-to-date, including $500 million during the third quarter, and have made more than $2 billion in dividend payments.  In total, our balanced cash deployment of nearly $4.2 billion represents over 100% of free cash flow return to our shareholders year-to-date. And we will continue these shareholder-friendly actions going forward as evidenced by our recent dividend increase and share repurchase program announcements. Moving onto Chart 7 in our 2021 guidance update, we've lowered our 2021 Outlook for sales and segment operating profit to reflect the previously discussed supply chain impacts that emerged in August and September. We've reduced our outlook for cash from operations primarily to reflect our updated plan to maintain our current $1.5 billion level of accelerated payments to our supply chain.  We plan to continue supporting our suppliers as they recover from pandemic related impacts, especially small and medium businesses both across the country and Internationally, to help maintain program schedules, and customer missions. The four-year outlook for earnings per share has increased $0.35 from the midpoint of last quarter's range, driven by Lockheed Martin Ventures investment gains and several non-operational items. Now, turning to Chart 8, we take a closer look at the current year revisions to 2021 sales by business area. As discussed, Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control and space have all been affected by lower than anticipated activity coming through our supply chain.  The level of reduction in supply chain activity over the past two months is higher than what we've been experiencing since the beginning of the pandemic and our 2021 Sales Outlook internationally assumes that we will see a return to more normal activity levels in the fourth quarter. In addition, our Sales Outlook for 2021, and our trending information for 2022 excludes any potential impacts associated with the recent Executive Order on safety protocols for Federal contractors. On Chart 9, we see segment operating profit tracking with the reduction in expected sales volume, and our expected segment operating margin outlook remains at 11%. On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our initial trending information for 2022.  We've estimated 2022 sales at approximately $66 billion, a decline of 1.5% from our projected 2021 results. As a reminder, the renationalization of our work and support the United Kingdom's atomic weapons establishment earlier this year, creates a headwind of just under $900 million on a year-over-year basis. We're expecting segment operating margins to remain at approximately 11% and we're projecting growth and cash from operations year-over-year to greater than, or equal to $8.4 billion. This Outlook assumes there will be no increase in tax payments related to capitalizing R&D costs. If current legislation is not amended, our cash from operations outlook could be reduced by up to $2 billion. Also, given we continue experiencing impacts across our supply chain, we now anticipate maintaining accelerated payments at the current $1.5 billion level through year-end 2022. Our prior multiyear cash forecast assume there would no longer be a need to accelerate payments to our supply chain beyond 2021. We are currently assuming a statutory corporate tax rate of 21% And we have not including any financial projections associated with closing the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition, which as Jim mentioned, is now expected to occur during the first quarter of 2022, subject to required regulatory approval. Turning to pension-related assumptions, interest rates have increased since year-end 2020. Our year-to-date actual returns have been higher than previously expected, and we've lowered our long-term rate of return to 6.5%.  In a response to investors asking for additional information on pension trends, we have included two charts on this topic in the appendix. These trends include no required pension contributions through 2025 based on current assumptions. On Chart 11, we outlined our expected capital deployment activities for 2022. We anticipate spending approximately $2 billion on capital projects next year, which represents an increase of approximately $300 million over expected 2021 levels. In addition, we anticipate investing approximately $1.5 billion on independent research and development activities, which represents a $200 million increase over planned 2021 levels. These investments are being made to enhance our delivery of critical systems and products to our customers as they execute their national security missions while ensuring we are well-positioned to compete for new business opportunities.  We will be making over $3 billion in dividend payments next year based on our recently announced $0.20 per share increase to our quarterly dividend rate. And as Jim shared earlier, we will also continue to strategically buy back shares when we believe they are trading below intrinsic value as they are now. We are planning to opportunistically repurchase up to $6 billion in shares over the next 12 to 18 months. We are confident we have the Balance Sheet flexibility and firepower to pursue all avenues of growth, while returning significant capital to our shareholders.  On chart 12, we provide some additional detail on our expected long-term trajectory for F-35 sales. As Jim commented earlier, we recently reached agreement with the Joint Program Office on our expected F-35 delivery plan. This joint plan represents the best intersection of production operations and supply chain capabilities. Technology insertion and supportive increasing mission requirements in both the timing and quantity of anticipated new production aircraft award decisions. We are very pleased with the outcome of this joint production replan as it provides stability and predictability across all key elements of this program.  Deliveries are expected to grow to a 156 aircraft by 2023 and will remain at that level for the foreseeable future. We are projecting F-35 production sales in 2022 will be lower than 2021 levels, and sales will also decline slightly in 2023. Revenues are expected to remain around 2023 levels throughout the balance of the forecasted timeframe. As we've previously discussed, the growth in F-35 sales volume will primarily be driven by sustainment activity as the number of deployed aircraft and associated flight hours grows rapidly, while we continue to aggressively pursue cost takeout in partnership with our customer.  Finally, we're also projecting modest growth and development activity as our customers continue seeking further advancements and capabilities for our unrivaled fifth-generation aircraft. To conclude on Chart 14, we have our summary. We've reduced our 2021 Outlook based on the higher-than-expected supply chain impacts we experienced during the third quarter. The supply chain and related production impacts, along with our updated F-35 production plan and the other factors Jim mentioned, have shaped our Outlook for 2022 and our future expectations.  Our strong Balance Sheet and cash generation give us multiple options to deploy cash and to echo Jim, we will prioritize investments, which will grow free cash flow per share. And with our broad portfolio, dedicated employees, strong Balance Sheet, and a disciplined in dynamic capital allocation strategy, we remain focused on our customers mission and long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: Certainly. And ladies and gentlemen, if you wish to ask a question, please [Operator Instructions]. You may withdraw your question at any time by repeating the 1-0 command. If you're using a speakerphone, please pick up the handset before pressing the numbers. [Operator Instructions] And first go the line of Rich Safran with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.\nRichard Safran: Jim, John, Greg, Good morning. Jim, John, I have a two-part question here on your 2020 to guide your long-term cash flow guide, and some of your opening remarks. What's the baseline budget that you're assuming in your guide? And specifically, if the plus-ups to the President's request from HASC and SASC are included, did that imply some upside to your '22 guide, or is it just to late for fiscal '22 funding to have an impact? And the second parts of my question is, so you lowered your cash from operations guide for '22. I want to know if you could discuss a bit more about what you think cash flow looks like beyond '22 and what you're assuming along with that. Thanks\nJohn Mollard: Yeah. Thanks, Richard. It's John. I'll take both parts of that two-part question. So first, in regards to the assumptions in and around the budget vary based on. We're using the president's budget of $715 billion for the government fiscal year 2022 in the trending information we've given you. I'd say we're encouraged by the direction of the various committee markups as they reflect really good support for a number of our programs. And to your question about how much if any of this will come through in 2022, the answer to that question is going to be based on how much incremental funding is actually appropriated, how long it takes for that appropriated funding to end up getting on contract with us and us following that down to our supply chain.  And then the third factor is what specific programs the incremental appropriations are applied to. It's easier, obviously, to maintain programs at current run rates than it is to accelerate programs. So any programs that we're planning in a trend down would be really good candidates for being able to see opportunities in 2022 related to increased appropriations. I'll finish this action by saying, obviously, by the time we're in January when we're giving you an updated outlook for 2022, we should have a lot more clarity in and around the budgetary trends. Now, turning to your second part, which had to do with -- we'd previously given multiyear -- operating cash flow guidance and of course, all these metrics are going to be assuming the R&D tax change does not go into effect our prior guidance was like 89991.  You've seen we've got our guidance now at 83 for this year and 84 for next year. And I will say we anticipate higher than 84 operating cash flow guidance as we look ahead to 2023. But really the only factor that's changed since the multiyear guidance we gave before is in the level and the duration of the accelerated payments we're planning to make to our supply chain. I think I mentioned in the script, we have previously in that 89991 track assumed we would be accelerating $1.2 billion worth of accelerated payments of the supply chain at year-end -- at the end of this year.  But then the assumption was the pandemic would be behind us in 2022, we'd unwind that program, we'd end 2022 with no accelerated payments being made through our supply chain. Our current forecast, the 83 and 84 assumes we're at $1.5 billion of accelerated payments at the end of this year and $1.5 billion of accelerated payments at the end of 2022. So the pandemic impacts are behind us. Before we end year-end 2022, our guide of 84 would increase by that $1.5 billion.\nRichard Safran: Thank you.\nJohn Mollard: You're welcome, Rich.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research, please go ahead.\nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nJohn Mollard: Good morning Rob.\nRobert Stallard: Jim, just a quick question and clarification on your five-year Sales Outlook, did you say you expected sales growth to accelerate after 2023? And then secondly, as a question, what are your expectations for operating margins over this period? Thank you.\nJames Taiclet: I'll speak to growth, Rob and make a point on operating margin then John can pick up on. Based on Hypersonics, classified programs, programs of record like CH-53K and others, we do believe that we'll have a rebound to meaningful growth 2023 and beyond. But again, that's also dependent on a number of factors, including the budget, etc., that we've just talked about. So yes, that is the idea, and frankly, we want to use this year-to period to accelerate share repurchase, reduced the accounts so when that inflection point does come on growth you will have as shareholders, basically an amplified benefit during that latter period, if you will. So we fully expect that with margins being pretty steady along the way, right John?\nJohn Mollard: Yeah. Absolutely. So Rob, I mean, just to kind of put stop with what Jim was saying to give a little color. The four categories that Jim mentioned is scripted remarks, Hypersonics, classified growth and programs record and competitive new starts. When I look at that subset of revenue, for those 4 categories in 2021, it's in the neighborhood of $17 billion. Over the period growing out through for the next 5 years, that set of activity, assuming we hit our operational marks, assuming these programs continue on their programs of record, and we win our share of these competitive new business opportunities that we've talked about, that $17 billion worth of program revenue today will grow at about 9% compound annual growth rate, which gives me some level of comfort that the longer-term trends that Jim has talked about will hold just to reiterate.  We're expecting a slight decline in 22 and bounce back in 2023. And then I would say increasing growth and increasing growth rates going forward now. Yes. On the topic of margins, I think 11% is a good working target for us given the evolution in our portfolio and the activity that we see going forward. I just highlighted the four categories that we'll be seeing growth, a lot of those are new start programs. There is going to be some growth in programs are record which we would hope to turn into accretive margin program. But there is a lot of growth in new start areas, developmental areas. The good news is we will get -- there will be cost reimbursable contracts, will have assurance of recovery of the costs we're incurring.  But they by definition will be lower margin activities moving forward. And I should mention, and this is just to get this on the record early, there are certain classified activities that we can't talk about but if those programs continue to progress along the track that they're on, my expectation is we will be making investments in some of those programs out in the '23, '24, '25 timeframe that will be dilutive to margins. But I think in balance on 11% operating margin is a good metric for us.\nOperator: Our next question is from Mike Maugeri with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMike Maugeri: Hey, good morning. Thank you for the time. So following on Rob's question, and you gave us the four priorities underpinning the growth forecast -- but Jim or John, can you give more specific and sort of quantify these buckets. How they translate to revenue in further into your outlook beyond 22 for a return to growth. And then separately, what headwinds are you anticipating to offset these growth buckets?\nJohn Mollard: Yeah. Sure Mike, it's John. I'll take and I will talk semantically first through the four buckets and growth over time, and then maybe now, as good a time as any to talk specifically about what we're seeing in moving from '21 to '22 and they headwinds, but the four big buckets, the first one is Hypersonic activity. Today, we're doing about $1.5 billion worth of revenue in that area. If we are able to move a number of those activities into -- from development into production, which we fully expect will happen, we're making great progress on a number of them that are visible and are being reported on today. But our projection would be assuming a number of those activities proceed into a production environment, that billion-and-a-half dollars to gross highest $3 billion by 2026. The second area classified in -- I'll say upfront we hesitated even highlighting this, given there's not a lot that we can say in general about classified activity.  But because it is a large and growing component of our business, we thought it was important at least give you top-level trend information. And because, like I said, we will be making investments in some of this activity downstream, which will have dilutive impacts, I thought it was a good idea to talk about. But in aggregate our classified portfolio will grow, we expect at a rate above 5%, so that is a strong growing area for us. The programs of record which as Jim take through some of the big ones you mentioned will be CH-53K, F-35 sustainment.  The PAC-3 program, and then additional growth in the Fleet Ballistic Missile and evolutions and new advances in that program that portfolio today is worth about $8.5 billion. When we project out to 2026 over that period of time, the compound annual growth rate in that program set is like an 8% and it's highlighted by CH-53K, where we will be delivering out to a program of record of 200 units. I think the final deliveries are made in 2032, but just keeping that program on its program of record will go a long way towards us achieving that growth in the program of record, Greg just talked about.  And then the final area is the new business, which are a set of wildcards. You're going to get binary decisions in and around the FLRAA competition, the FARA competition. One of the new business areas that Jim talked about as next-generation interceptor. We successfully moved into a down select, where there's ourselves and one other competitor. We're making great progress. We've achieved a number of important program milestones recently, we feel good about where we're heading.  But that'll be a down select and then sort of the wildcard in the bunch. An opportunity we're very excited about is the KCY tanker program, where we've announced that we will be teaming with Airbus, who we think as a very capable frame for doing this mission. I think we bring extensive experience in the mission capabilities that would go onto that Air frame. I think we make a very formidable team. We're very excited about that opportunity. And depending on outcomes, I mean, obviously, we're doing next enough and either any of those programs besides the next-generation interceptor.  Yeah, that growth rate could be explosive. If we prevail on FLRAA and FARA, which we think we're very well-positioned to do, if we're down selected on NGI and a tanker program is awarded to us, there will be substantial growth in that bucket. And they headwinds, I guess like I said, now, let's tactically kind of walk through the 2021 outlook of roughly $67 billion and how that translates as we look ahead to 2022. Obviously you look at the math and we're down about a billion dollars.  The obvious large year-to-year headwind is related to the AWE re-nationalization, which I believe either Jim or I talked about, in our script is being a headwind of just under $900 million. The second headwind you'll see on our F-35 revenue chart, we're projecting a decrease in F-35 production related revenue up about $400 million moving from '21 to '22. And then we have two programs that are sort of in international lifecycle evolution, very successful programs, but they delivered out, and that's the Black Hawk helicopter program. And by delivered out, I mean, it's on the -- it's moving down from the peak. The number of helicopters we're going to deliver this year will be cut in half by the time we're two years out.  And then our highly successful next-generation OPI or program, both of those programs, moving from '21 to '22, if you combine the downtick in revenue, that aggregates to about $600 million. And then one of the other external factors was the recently announced and executed withdrawal of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. The primary impact to us is in a contract of special ops, logistics support program and we had some other Afghan draw down related impacts. In total it's about a $200 million a year-over-year headwind. But now as I pivot to the plus side, one of the programs, it's ramping up.  Year-over-year, is one of those in the -- I call it competitive category. We talked about the next-generation interceptor where we're doing about $200 million in revenue in 2021. We expect to do about $600 million of revenue in 2022. we have a lot of growth, as we mentioned within our classified activity. A lot of that activity is being done in our skunk works organization within aeronautics. That work is going to be growing about $400 million year-over-year. And a final large program, a record growth is in the CH-53K heavy lift, where we'd expect to see $300 million year-over-year growth. So on balance, it's down that the headwind is removal of the AWE activity we were doing.\nOperator: Our next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research, please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiroi: Yes. Just to follow up on your comments on the sectors. First, AWE at $900 million hit, I thought that program had been running more like three or 350 million a quarter. And obviously it's really only the first half that overlaps for 21 to 22, so if you comment on that. And then if you looked at each of the sectors there, I would think that the Aeronautics would be down maybe a billion, billion and a half dollars. But you'd get some growth in RMS, you get some growth in Space x, the AWE. So if you could just kind of comment on that status.\nJohn Mollard: Sure, George. Thanks for the question. So if you go back to our first second quarter press releases that -- we probably haven't the year-to-date. AWE first quarter activity this year was $440 million, AWE activity in the second quarter was $435 million some those still you get the $875 million level of activity, we saw probably higher than what you might have remembered because you had a lot of wrap-up associated activity that took place, but say $875 million in 2021 that won't recur. And maybe what I'll do is do a high level sort of around the horn of how those the headwinds and tailwinds play out by segment.  The first segment we talked about is Aeronautics. As we look ahead to '22 we're expecting low single-digit growth rates in Aeronautics with a slight increase in margins, think of 10-20 basis point range. Within Missiles and Fire Control, we're actually expecting a slight decline, a low -- think of it as a low-single-digit decline with margins slightly lower than 2021 levels at again, 10 - 20 basis points. If you go to RMS, we're expecting a low single-digit decline as well, with margins maybe up to 40 basis points below what we going to end up with in 2021. And then finally at Space, we're expecting mid-single-digit declines. Obviously, that's where the AWE reduction takes place. With margins comparable to what we were expecting for 2021.\nJames Taiclet: George, it's Jim. Just to give you a little more color on, just pick one RMS. John already mentioned the Black Hawk is going to be down next year-to-year, and the CH-53K is up. They actually offset each other. So in 2022 it's a launch between, let's call it those two programs. And then similarly we get combat rescue helicopter upside, maybe 100 million, but probably the plan is VH-92A production down about 100 to 150 million they upset. You might remember that we were part of the Australia Future Conventional Sub program.  Well, that's gotten deferred into a nuclear submarine propulsion option, and we're going to compete for that, but it's going to be a while before that kicks in. There's another 150, so. There are puts and takes in every VA, if you will. And it's part of -- again, new administration, some changes in priorities, changes in alliances. I think they all settle out to the good, but it's going to take a couple of years to get through all that kind of maneuvering. And we're going to do the best we can in the next couple of years to make sure that there's a flattish period for our Company.  As far as revenue, we're going to really Double down or triple down on returning cash to shareholders because we've got it. And the other thing I'd say, George real quick to add on to something that John said earlier. We are voluntarily continuing our acceleration of payments to supply chain. This is something for the good of the industry, for the good of the customer and we will want to contribute as all of us are in our own ways in this country to recovering from COVID. And again, when -- as John said, when COVID subsides, we will get that cash flow number back to where you thought it was going to be in the first place. So just a couple of color commentaries on there because I think you guys are asking some really good questions.\nOperator: And next we go to Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead.\nPete Skibitski: Yes. Good morning. Hey, guys, can you give us greater insight into the supply chain because it seems like we're in a period here where cash flow terms are unusually generous. So it's hard to understand why they'd be in such financial strain. Is it all related to things like just labor availability or COVID mandates or semiconductor shortage? Can you give us greater insight as to why the supply chain is in such dire strains, given the cash flow terms that they've been operating under?\nJohn Mollard: Yeah. Pete, good question. And I think a large part of the impact that our supply chain is facing our, in our suppliers that are dual use. I mean, they're supplying to both commercial aerospace and defense. So if we're looking at parts of the supply chain that are strictly defense, they're probably not nearly as stress financially as our dual use suppliers, people that don't make landing gear for us and they'll make landing gear for commercial aircraft, they make brakes.  Those are the suppliers that have fixed operating costs that have seen substantial revenue decreases on the commercial supply on that have really caught in to their operating cash flow. And we think it's the right thing to do. We have access to capital, we have access to cash at extremely good rate. We generate a lot of cash flow. It's in -- as Jim said, it's in the industry's interest, it's in our customers interest, and frankly, there is an element of self-preservation here, we need our supply chain to be successful for us to be successful. So while it's voluntary, it's not a 100% Altria. I mean, we need to make commitments. We need especially our dual use vendors and partners, our supply chain partners to be successful for the long term.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Ron Epstein with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: Hey, good morning. Maybe if we could just back up the aperture a little bit. Jim, when you first came on board, you talked a lot about focus on the 21st Century war fighter, war fighting, connectivity, that sort of thing. Then we shifted a little bit maybe with the acquisition of Rocketdyne. And now here we are. It seems like the story has now shifted to the cash return story with no growth. And I think, what's on a lot of people's mind is ultimately, what is the strategy? I mean, where you've taken a Company and what's the vision here. It really seems -- -- and all this maybe might sound unfair, but it seems a little bit loose right now. At least from an outsider's perspective, if you could give us some color on that?\nJames Taiclet: When you're run a business, Ron in a dynamic industry with changing government, when government is your major customer, you've got to be agile, right? Now the first thing you mentioned is the long-term strategy to companies. We're going to deliver on our programs of record where that drive operational excellence, but we're driving it towards a mission-oriented paradigm at the end of the day at Lockheed Martin versus a product paradigm, which we've been operating under since at least before World War II. So that paradigm is still there. We're working towards it.  In the meantime, we got to deliver for you all as shareholders financially and we got to deliver for our customers operationally. But I'm getting -- I'd like to think tremendous traction with senior government officials in the U.S. and elsewhere that understand that while our industry and their purchase of our products and services over the years has been effective, it's largely effective in the physical world, if you will. [inaudible 00:48:29] world. We're really good at technologies like Hypersonics, Space Travel, Precision Weapons, etc.  Those are [Indiscernible] world we're really good at that as an industry and our customer knows how to buy that stuff. Well, we're not as good as we need to be in the defense industry is merging that excellence in the physical world that we can bring to national defense. But merging that with the developments, the accelerated developments in the digital world by companies that have specialized in things like 5G and AI distributed computing and networking. Because if we merge those two things together in the ways that we're forecasting and we're building technology roadmaps to do, we will increase the effectiveness of our current set of platforms and a faster and more robust way than can be done, and just using the attributes in the physical world technologies.  We're going to keep doing all of that, but we can actually turn on an after burner for mission capability for our customers by accelerating those digital technologies into our space and that is our strategy. The benefit of that is in addition to having a more effective national defense at relatively efficient cost, is that it will make our platforms more attractive than relative at the other OEMS platforms, because we intend to build the Architecture first with its path liners with some of our platforms and bringing others as we get some success. That is a strategy of the Company.  It is not changed in IOTA, but our capital allocation strategies had to change because of dynamic situations we find ourselves in externally. And in our M&A, approach has had to evolve because there's not that much supply out there in our industry as far as acquisition candidates have any scale and a regulatory environment is also shifting a bit. So we're shifting with it and we're saying okay, we still got our baseline strategy. Twenty-First Century warfare is we're, we need to end up down the road with our customer. We wanted to get there partly through acquisition like Aerojet Rocketdyne and i3 to get the technology is mainly in the physical world that we need to move those things forward.  But the M&A window isn't that open right now for valuation, availability, and regulatory regime. We just think in doing the things that you have to do when you're running an actual business in the real-world, which is being agile. The one thing I want to add to that because there may be some misconception about -- Ron. Thank you for the question. By the way, it open this up. I want to make absolutely clear that our M&A approach, does not and has not included the acquisition of major commercial technology or telecom companies.  We're not trying to become that. We want to use their IP, their people to accelerate that kind of technology, that digital technology in our world. So our approach is to partner with industry leaders in those spaces via commercial agreements, licensing, joined teaming, and participation standards bodies to accelerate those capabilities into our technology road maps. We have no intention of acquiring emerging with any of those major commercial sector companies. So yeah, you've got to be dynamic and agile when you run a business this big in the real world, and that's what we're up to. And we still have our target being the past liner towards 21st Century National Defense.\nJohn Mollard: And Ron, this is John. Just to pile on to what Jim said. He's done a very good job of articulating a strategy from an external perspective, but as guided spend with this Company for over 30 years, what I most see and resonate with is how gyms actively change in the culture across Lockheed Martin internally. To embrace any kind of innovative technology, despite where they come from we've had allowed of really bright creative scientists and engineers, but we don't have to invent the solution to every single problem. And historically we've struggled with some level of not-invented-here, which probably may come as no surprise to somebody yet.  What Jim has been stressing and our team is getting is, we need to identify and partner with whoever does have the best solution in an industry agnostic manner. And I think we're doing a pretty good job of that in our ventures, investment fund, where we're going to startups, and seeing the art of the possible. We're starting to get pull demand from the business areas for some of these technologies, which I personally view as a huge step in the right direction. And it's drive in that mindset, the openness to technology across the entire R&D and engineering community. So I haven't seen a change and I appreciate the direction from an internal perspective.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, just a quick reminder, if you do have a question, please press [Operator Instructions] at this time. And next we will go to the line of Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. I think certainly the markets -- looking at the 22 cascade in particular. And John I just want to clarify something. So the 1.5 billion of supplier advances that you mentioned you hadn't planned on, are those net from -- in other words, are you suggesting that the prior guidance included zero, now it's 1.5, and so pro forma and the move from the prior guidance is operationally towards the 9.5 billion?\nJohn Mollard: Yes.\nMyles Walton: So then it's 23, 9.9 billion?\nJohn Mollard: Let me make sure we're tracked, and the prior guide was [Indiscernible] and 9.\nMyles Walton: Yeah.\nJohn Mollard: Today, we're doing [Indiscernible], and in that [Indiscernible] is a billion-and-a-half that was not there. So we're up $300 million. I'm telling you, today, our [Indiscernible] is going to be higher -- will be higher than [Indiscernible] in 2023. Depending on how much we still have to accelerate in 2023, are that number can be anywhere from a billion dollars higher to $100 million higher or $200 million higher. So the punch line is if you think about the two years, '21 and '22 were ahead, dependent on the outcome of where COVID is and either '22 or '23, we could be equal to or slightly behind the prior multiyear guidance if that makes sense.\nMyles Walton: It does, but I guess the question is these are advances that presumably rotate back to you. So that's why I'm asking, about '23 and beyond. Would be [inaudible 00:55:25]\nJames Taiclet: So you don't get the full benefit of a 1.5 billion because this is a rolling -- a roll-off, if you will, quarter-to-quarter as you go through the year. So there's some subset of that as John is saying. Depending when the music stops, we will be able to then elevate the cash flow we report because we didn't do a quarter or two of the typical flow - throughs to the supply chain.\nJohn Mollard: Right.\nJames Taiclet: That's going to be the whole year.\nJohn Mollard: Yes. Just to make sure we're on 100% the same baseline. The old guidance was 89, 90, 91. Today, let's just use as a baseline 83, 84 and 85, that's down $1.8 billion. If we're at 85, we've got over a billion dollars of assumed advances at the end of 2023. So you could say notionally, where we're sitting here today over the three-year period were down $800 million and some of that is driven by what I've now assumed in terms of -- we have an internal term. It's funding that we are authorization spending we do in advance of contract turn - ons based on history, there's a high likelihood that some of these programs on a shift from development to production, but customer funding profiles aren't going to align with need dates. we are anticipating that we will be carrying a substantial amount of costs associated with that transition.\nMyles Walton: I'll stick to one. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question is from Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai Von Rumohr: Yes. Thank you very much. So. Jim, I'm a little confused with the capital deployment. You talk about spending an incremental amount in terms of IRND, you're going to increase the dividend, you have less CAS recovery. You talked of 6.6 billion of stock repurchase. But if you do AJRD, you can't do any stock repurchase unless you really living up a balance sheet. What kind of a balance sheet a net debt to EBITDA ratio are you looking for over this period?\nJohn Mollard: Hey, Cai, it's John, I'll take that. If you look at our operating cash flow and free cash flow or net debt retirements over the -- I'll stick to the first three years of the plan. Our excess cash balances would allow us to do the $6 billion we're talking about and still have enough liquidity to run the business, so that's point 0.1. The $6 billion is just deploying what would otherwise have been set in my bank account, earning 25 basis points. That's 0.1. 0.2 with AJRD, our original expectation was, we were probably finance call it 3 billion of the 4.5 and used cash for the other 1.5 billion. I'm leaning now towards, especially given how low financing rates are, maybe financing the entire acquisition.  But kind of more broadly, the way I think about acquisitions and I know Jim and I are absolutely in a 100% violent agreement on this. If you can find M&A that has the right operational fit, the right culture fit, and the right strategic fit, M&A pays for itself. I mean, it's free. You have to finance some upfront but if it's a good deal, you're going to get your money back very quickly. So I view like Jim does, M&A is not a drain on your Balance Sheet. Our Balance Sheet, as you know, is single A. Our metrics would support a higher rating.  We're a minus for the two that do use the A minus scale. Conversations I've been having was it's hard to justify why we're in A minus instead of a flat A. The punch line is we've got a tremendous amount of firepower. If as Jim talked about the discipline and dynamic capital allocation process says, we need to put additional resources in here, there or wherever. We're going to have the ability to do that.\nJames Taiclet: And from a leverage perspective, we've got upside. I mean, we're -- we've got a strong Balance Sheet and really tried to emphasize in the prepared remarks that we see tremendous value in share repurchase at these pricing levels. We will go to the capital markets to get the resources to make the smartest capital allocation at that point in time, and we'll manage the leverage as we go. And we can do it all. Everything you said, we can do it all and maintain a reasonable leverage ratio, I believe, and a strong credit rating. I also, and John also believe so.\nOperator: Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hello, everyone.\nJohn Mollard: Hello.\nNoah Poponak: I guess I'm still trying to better understand how much of the growth projection shortfall versus what the market was looking for is, end market versus Lockheed programs. And I know Jim, you talked about there being multiple puts and takes. But AWE, I guess you're saying a few years of flat revenue to up low-single-digit growth. What do you assume -- are you assuming that's what outlays are doing, putting the 22 authorizations specifically aside, is that where you're assuming outlays are doing, are you assuming you're worse than outlays? And then specifically at MFC, what's happened at MFC, because one point the growth rate was high, the Company was saying good growth was sustainable, that there was really just capital and supply constraint. Now it's down in the quarter and you're saying it's down next year, so that seems to have changed a decent amount.\nJohn Mollard: It's John. I'll take the question. I would characterize the '21 to '22 headwinds as maybe being unique to us in some regards, although companies have a lot of exposure or had a lot of exposure to Afghanistan, for example. They may have similar headwinds. But I'd say the '21 to '22 headwinds are maybe confined to us, but the out-year growth, I think when I looked at the last track on the President's Budget, the growth rate was 2%. A year for government fiscal year '23, '24, '25 and out. I see that as a center point. Again, if we're able though, to prevail in competitions, I see a path for us to grow faster than that rate. We need to perform on our programs, we need to deliver helicopters and airplanes on our committed schedules, and if we do that, I see upside to the 2% growth that's in the President's budget.\nJames Taiclet: And in MFC more specifically, the PAC-3 production is going to go up and we've been investing in that capacity as you know. But it's going to go up a couple 100 million and then again, if you do puts and takes that special ops logistics support program itself was [Indiscernible]. In MFC, just that one program takes away all the PAC-3 growth year-over-year into '22, and then we had probably not as well known but a for the for MFC is significant cancellation in the UK there's no warrior armored vehicle program that was canceled by the UK government and that was another $100 million downdraft. And then that is tailing off a little bit too now and production rates. not much, but another 100 million.  So you really have to dig in the details in each VA to see why '21, '22, '23 effects are happening. But we really are focusing on 2023 plus, so to speak, or beyond 2023, because all of these programmatic effects will be known by then. we've got those four big areas where we assume and expect that there's going to be material upside. We'll understand that way better at that point. And then we'll have some of those new starts that if the competition stay on time, we may know some decisions and those too.  So there's going to be some puts and takes at Lockheed Martin specifically the next couple of years, but we're positioning ourselves to weather this period and get through with a lower share count -- materially, I think lower share count by the end of it. And then a growth factor that has an inclination to it post 2023. And that's really our overall financial strategy is to work the share count, rewards shareholders along the way, and then an inflection point in growth is what we're aiming for. That's our goal.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies, please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys. And thank you for including me.\nJohn Mollard: Thanks, Sheila.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe just to follow up on Noah 's question. If we could talk about the shorter term, 2022 and 2023, because I do think that's what investors are focused on. What could be the potential element of upside surprise? You guys mentioned 8.5 billion of the portfolio is focused on growing programs like CH-53K and PAC-3. Is that what we would look to or there're other elements that come in?\nJohn Mollard: Yes. Thanks, Sheila. I think its growth and opportunities across the big four categories that Jim has articulated. A lot of our potential upside in 2023 is going to come from programs that are right now in operational testing, assuming they're able to achieve success through that, those test programs they are going to migrate into production. In the period where you still have an overlap between development and production that's where you're going to start seeing some bulge and that kind of transition ties into the probably to extended discussion how with Myles, about if you look out at the 2023 year yield, you acumen to three years while you slightly down from the last guide.  I think we're going to be successful, we're going to need to bridge those programs to maintain their critical schedule, so we're going to carry a financial backstop against them. But there is absolutely no doubt the growth is going to come out of hypersonics, classified and growth in the programs are record. I mean, Jim mentioned PAC-3 growing 200 million going from '21 to '22. In '21 we're going to deliver 350 routes, were going to be delivering 500 in 2023 and 550 million in 2025. So PAC-3 growth is going to be very strong in that period of time and CH-53K really starts levering. And if we -- when we prevail on the Future Vertical Lift Program, you will see an inflection point as well.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Thank you, John.\nJohn Mollard: You're welcome Sheila.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to really go to two issues that I think are related. In talking about strategy and in the past, we've talked about JADC2 and a lot of the things you're thinking about long term, which I think of is important as platform as may be, is much more about systems, processing, software, sensors, cams, and so forth, and integration. But when I look at where F-35 is today, one of the big challenges, there is an integration program, and it's been Tech Refresh 3 that I think, by any measure, has not gone the way it has hoped -- been hoped. Can you talk about where tech refresh 3 to move to block 4 stands today, what risks that may pose for F-35 rates going forward? But then also, if you extrapolate that and if I'm to think about doing broader systems of architectures across domains, how do I get confident that the integration capabilities you have are the best to deliver on that? So it's the combination of both the F-35 situation and taking that to a long-term strategy.\nJames Taiclet: Sure, Douglas, it's Jim. So I'll start with TR-3, which a just a microcosm of the larger picture. But an important one TR-3 gives you -- and I supply this jets. Similar ones, at least. It gives you a better cockpit display, a more processing for data in the airplane, and more data storage in the airplane. All good things for 21st Century warcraft. Although they are not essential to beginning the journey into networking that jet more closely with other systems and other platforms. So we're doing those two things parallel [inaudible 01:09:30] independent. TR-3 has also been delayed a bit. We're working with the [Indiscernible].  We feel we're on a common schedule now. We've got some significant supply chain issues that we've had to embed our own engineers into our suppliers to try to get them to perform. We're counting on them. That's important. But it's not going to deter or defer us from our goal of really developing the F-35 platform to be the aeronautics cornerstone of our architecture for 21st century warfare.  Because yes, once TR-3 is in, it will take another leapfrog up in data storage and data processing capabilities and networking capabilities which we will add. But we're already demonstrating how to do that with The hybrid base station that we actually flying a U-2 that provides that connectivity today with the Tech Refresh to equipment on the jet. So these things are related but not directed a differential or coterminous, they aren't be coterminous. We will get both of these jobs done, and the broadest program here, what we've -- I think derived by working with our government customers so far and understanding contracts and things is that, there won't be a overarching JADC2 of any kind.  What there will be is in reality in this business and I think in our customer construct, is that a technology roadmap and this has been developed more since maybe the last time you and I talked about this, Doug. But it's going to be a technology roadmap which is platform-by-platform connectivity using an open architecture set of standards and protocols that the whole industry can share. And we're going to be doing that one stage at a time. And what I want to do and I have been talking to our customers about at the most senior level is to provide every six to 12 months a mission capability by implementing this technology roadmap mission by mission.  Now we've got 14 missions and we've got 14 technologies coincidentally that we have completed three of those missions, which happened to be counterair, surface warfare, and integrated air and missile defense. We're showing customers those road maps and getting feedback on what platforms we should be tying together first, and getting those sensors, the decision making, command and control systems, and actual effectors connected in the most optimal way every 6-12 months. So we're moving out on both fronts [Indiscernible] is, again, associated, but not essential for moving out on the 21st Century Warfare Front.\nGreg Gardner: Okay. Thank you, John. I think we've got a little over our normal time, but there's been outstanding conversation today. I think at this time, I'll turn it over to Jim for some closing remarks.\nJames Taiclet: Sure, Greg. As I conclude the call today, I want to end by reinforcing our commitment to delivering long-term value to our shareholders here. While using our strong cash flow and robust Balance Sheet to do so, we're not shy about leverage, we're not shy about moving out with speed and with scale as we've talked about. Similarly, and again, along the way, we are going to work hard and invest to advance our customers important missions along the way. Those numbers are gone through around to 2 billion of CapEx and 1.5 billion of [inaudible 01:13:15] They're not incremental, they are up from our recent history, but they are not at an incremental 2 billion and incremental 1.5 billion just to be clear on that.  So I just want to make sure everybody knows our approach here. We're going to be positioning ourselves for growth inflection that we hope and expect to see a couple of years down the road. And by doing the share repurchase at the scale we're discussing in the timeframe we're looking at. The for sure valuation -- a value of that growth inflection should be amplified. That's our goal here. And thanks again for all of you for joining us on this call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in January. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today on our third quarter, 2021 earnings call. In a few moments, John, will provide a detailed review of our quarterly results, updated 2021 guidance and trending information for 2022. But first I will provide a five-year Sales Outlook and discuss our plans for accelerating capabilities to our customers and driving per-share value to our shareholders over that time horizon.  Last month, I lead our executive leadership team as we completed our annual strategic and financial planning process. Given the scope of changes in our operating environment over the past year, we conducted a more in-depth and extended assessment of our financial forecast. Based on these strategic and financial reviews in the information available to us today, our current expectation is that sales in 2022 will decline slightly from our expected 2021 sales level.  We then anticipate sales will increase slightly in 2023 with steadily increasing sales growth through 2026. This sales trajectory reflects a number of factors, including the continuing effects of the ongoing COVID pandemic and extended delivery timelines across our supply chain, moderating growth rates in the U.S. defense budget, shifts in customer priorities driven by recent events such as the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, and the re-nationalization of the AWE program in the UK. And our recently completed agreement with the F-35 Joint Program Office on a rebase lining of aircraft deliveries under our production program.  I'll address the significant agreement a little later in my remarks. It was all forward projections, our performance on current programs, our ability to wait highly competitive new starts, the size of future defense budgets, and the global geopolitical landscape will all influence our ultimate growth rate over the coming five years. But as we look ahead, there are four primary areas that underpin our longer-term growth forecast. The first of these future growth areas is within our Hypersonics portfolio.  We're currently performing on six Hypersonics programs across the Company, and following the successful completion of ongoing testing and evaluation activity. Multiple programs are expected to enter production between 2023 and 2026. The second growth area is within our classified activity. Three of our four business areas are engaged in significant classified development programs and pending successful achievement of the objectives within those programs. We expect to begin the transition from development to production, again, between 23 and 26.  The third area of expected growth lies in our current programs of record. Our portfolio is very well aligned with our customers mission requirements, and as a result, we have multiple programs from each business area entering growth stages. This includes the CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, F-35 sustainment activity, increased PAC-3 production rates, and the modernization and enhancements to the Fleet Ballistic Missile. And, finally, we're in competition for several significant new business awards, including the future vertical lift, FLRAA and FARA competitions.  The next-generation interceptor program, and the KCY tanker program. These represent meaningful opportunities to accelerate our projected top-line growth profile with new long-term projects that are critical to our national defense. Now I would like to discuss our strategy for driving strong returns for our shareholders in the near term while remaining well positioned for our expected return to growth in 2023. The central tenet of our value creation strategy is using a disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process. We will first reinvest capital into our business to meet our customers requirements and drive organic growth.  Concurrently, we will continue pursuing actionable inorganic growth opportunities that strengthen our core business. And we will return cash to shareholders through increasing dividend payments and a significantly expanded share re-purchase program. To drive sustainable organic growth, we will continue making significant investments in our business area. These investments include nearly $2 billion of annual capital expenditures and approximately $1.5 billion in independent research and development spending each year.  These investments are being made in our signature platforms and systems to provide our customers with the high-value solutions they're going to need to execute their missions of deterring if necessary defeating the pacing threats across all domains of operations. Additionally, we are transforming our internal operations with a model-based engineering and enterprise architecture. And we are building digital factories of the future. These investments and state-of-the-art engineering, manufacturing, and sustainment tools and techniques will ensure our business areas can continue delivering outstanding performance leveled on current programs, while also positioning us to prevail an upcoming campaigns.  After making these significant investments in our business to support our customers, and drive organic growth, we expect to have substantial free cash flows available to return to you, the shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Last month, the board increased our quarterly dividends by $0.20, or approximately 8% to $2.80 per share, and now $11.20 per share annually, providing shareholders, especially our yield investors, with strong returns. This action marks the 20th consecutive year that the board increased Lockheed Martin's quarterly dividend.  Along with making an increased quarterly dividend payment, we will also provide additional value to shareholders by returning excess cash to them through a greatly expanded share repurchase program. As discussed in today's press release, we've already repurchased $2 billion of our shares through the first three quarters of 2021. And last month, on my recommendation, the board increased our remaining share repurchase authority by $5 billion, bringing our current total share repurchase authority to approximately $6 billion. With our stock trading at a level well below what we calculate as the Company's intrinsic value, we have significantly increased our planned share buybacks, and I anticipate that we will repurchase up to $6 billion of our shares over the next 12, 18 months, if conditions warrant.  As a final note on shareholder value, we're going to dynamically allocate capital to the highest return opportunities, prioritizing investments that lead to growing free cash flow per share. That's our new metric. We will remain opportunistic and pursuing accretive bolt-on acquisitions, evaluate additional increases to our current share purchase authorization, and continue to reinvest capital to our business to drive long-term growth. We have the Balance Sheet flexibility and firepower to pursue multiple avenues of growth while returning significant capital to our shareholders.  We built this Balance Sheet to use it and we will do so. Consistent with our focus on long-term shareholders value creation. Our strong Balance Sheet provides us with the capability to close on the Aerojet Rocketdyne transaction, provide robust returns to shareholders and continue to invest in our portfolio to support our customers and drive future growth. The Aerojet Rocketdyne transaction continues moving through the regulatory approval process and we now anticipate closing in the first quarter of 2022.  Before I turn the call over to John, I'd like to highlight the efforts of the entire F-35 organization, including the government's Joint Program office, our teammates and suppliers, our Aeronautics Organization, and our international partners for establishing a new aircraft production baseline and delivery profile that will provide industry government, partner countries and FMS customers, as well as you, the investor community, with important visibility well into the future. The program is strong and stable, and we have opportunities ahead of us to add to that strength. The program has delivered over 700 production aircraft out of a plan of record of over 3,300 jets, including to all 3 U.S. services and 9 international customers so far. And we look forward to continuing the successful program for decades to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to John and I'll rejoin you to answer your questions. I'll speak to growth, Rob and make a point on operating margin then John can pick up on. Based on Hypersonics, classified programs, programs of record like CH-53K and others, we do believe that we'll have a rebound to meaningful growth 2023 and beyond. But again, that's also dependent on a number of factors, including the budget, etc., that we've just talked about. So yes, that is the idea, and frankly, we want to use this year-to period to accelerate share repurchase, reduced the accounts so when that inflection point does come on growth you will have as shareholders, basically an amplified benefit during that latter period, if you will. So we fully expect that with margins being pretty steady along the way, right John? George, it's Jim. Just to give you a little more color on, just pick one RMS. John already mentioned the Black Hawk is going to be down next year-to-year, and the CH-53K is up. They actually offset each other. So in 2022 it's a launch between, let's call it those two programs. And then similarly we get combat rescue helicopter upside, maybe 100 million, but probably the plan is VH-92A production down about 100 to 150 million they upset. You might remember that we were part of the Australia Future Conventional Sub program.  Well, that's gotten deferred into a nuclear submarine propulsion option, and we're going to compete for that, but it's going to be a while before that kicks in. There's another 150, so. There are puts and takes in every VA, if you will. And it's part of -- again, new administration, some changes in priorities, changes in alliances. I think they all settle out to the good, but it's going to take a couple of years to get through all that kind of maneuvering. And we're going to do the best we can in the next couple of years to make sure that there's a flattish period for our Company.  As far as revenue, we're going to really Double down or triple down on returning cash to shareholders because we've got it. And the other thing I'd say, George real quick to add on to something that John said earlier. We are voluntarily continuing our acceleration of payments to supply chain. This is something for the good of the industry, for the good of the customer and we will want to contribute as all of us are in our own ways in this country to recovering from COVID. And again, when -- as John said, when COVID subsides, we will get that cash flow number back to where you thought it was going to be in the first place. So just a couple of color commentaries on there because I think you guys are asking some really good questions. When you're run a business, Ron in a dynamic industry with changing government, when government is your major customer, you've got to be agile, right? Now the first thing you mentioned is the long-term strategy to companies. We're going to deliver on our programs of record where that drive operational excellence, but we're driving it towards a mission-oriented paradigm at the end of the day at Lockheed Martin versus a product paradigm, which we've been operating under since at least before World War II. So that paradigm is still there. We're working towards it.  In the meantime, we got to deliver for you all as shareholders financially and we got to deliver for our customers operationally. But I'm getting -- I'd like to think tremendous traction with senior government officials in the U.S. and elsewhere that understand that while our industry and their purchase of our products and services over the years has been effective, it's largely effective in the physical world, if you will. [inaudible 00:48:29] world. We're really good at technologies like Hypersonics, Space Travel, Precision Weapons, etc.  Those are [Indiscernible] world we're really good at that as an industry and our customer knows how to buy that stuff. Well, we're not as good as we need to be in the defense industry is merging that excellence in the physical world that we can bring to national defense. But merging that with the developments, the accelerated developments in the digital world by companies that have specialized in things like 5G and AI distributed computing and networking. Because if we merge those two things together in the ways that we're forecasting and we're building technology roadmaps to do, we will increase the effectiveness of our current set of platforms and a faster and more robust way than can be done, and just using the attributes in the physical world technologies.  We're going to keep doing all of that, but we can actually turn on an after burner for mission capability for our customers by accelerating those digital technologies into our space and that is our strategy. The benefit of that is in addition to having a more effective national defense at relatively efficient cost, is that it will make our platforms more attractive than relative at the other OEMS platforms, because we intend to build the Architecture first with its path liners with some of our platforms and bringing others as we get some success. That is a strategy of the Company.  It is not changed in IOTA, but our capital allocation strategies had to change because of dynamic situations we find ourselves in externally. And in our M&A, approach has had to evolve because there's not that much supply out there in our industry as far as acquisition candidates have any scale and a regulatory environment is also shifting a bit. So we're shifting with it and we're saying okay, we still got our baseline strategy. Twenty-First Century warfare is we're, we need to end up down the road with our customer. We wanted to get there partly through acquisition like Aerojet Rocketdyne and i3 to get the technology is mainly in the physical world that we need to move those things forward.  But the M&A window isn't that open right now for valuation, availability, and regulatory regime. We just think in doing the things that you have to do when you're running an actual business in the real-world, which is being agile. The one thing I want to add to that because there may be some misconception about -- Ron. Thank you for the question. By the way, it open this up. I want to make absolutely clear that our M&A approach, does not and has not included the acquisition of major commercial technology or telecom companies.  We're not trying to become that. We want to use their IP, their people to accelerate that kind of technology, that digital technology in our world. So our approach is to partner with industry leaders in those spaces via commercial agreements, licensing, joined teaming, and participation standards bodies to accelerate those capabilities into our technology road maps. We have no intention of acquiring emerging with any of those major commercial sector companies. So yeah, you've got to be dynamic and agile when you run a business this big in the real world, and that's what we're up to. And we still have our target being the past liner towards 21st Century National Defense. So you don't get the full benefit of a 1.5 billion because this is a rolling -- a roll-off, if you will, quarter-to-quarter as you go through the year. So there's some subset of that as John is saying. Depending when the music stops, we will be able to then elevate the cash flow we report because we didn't do a quarter or two of the typical flow - throughs to the supply chain. That's going to be the whole year. And from a leverage perspective, we've got upside. I mean, we're -- we've got a strong Balance Sheet and really tried to emphasize in the prepared remarks that we see tremendous value in share repurchase at these pricing levels. We will go to the capital markets to get the resources to make the smartest capital allocation at that point in time, and we'll manage the leverage as we go. And we can do it all. Everything you said, we can do it all and maintain a reasonable leverage ratio, I believe, and a strong credit rating. I also, and John also believe so. And in MFC more specifically, the PAC-3 production is going to go up and we've been investing in that capacity as you know. But it's going to go up a couple 100 million and then again, if you do puts and takes that special ops logistics support program itself was [Indiscernible]. In MFC, just that one program takes away all the PAC-3 growth year-over-year into '22, and then we had probably not as well known but a for the for MFC is significant cancellation in the UK there's no warrior armored vehicle program that was canceled by the UK government and that was another $100 million downdraft. And then that is tailing off a little bit too now and production rates. not much, but another 100 million.  So you really have to dig in the details in each VA to see why '21, '22, '23 effects are happening. But we really are focusing on 2023 plus, so to speak, or beyond 2023, because all of these programmatic effects will be known by then. we've got those four big areas where we assume and expect that there's going to be material upside. We'll understand that way better at that point. And then we'll have some of those new starts that if the competition stay on time, we may know some decisions and those too.  So there's going to be some puts and takes at Lockheed Martin specifically the next couple of years, but we're positioning ourselves to weather this period and get through with a lower share count -- materially, I think lower share count by the end of it. And then a growth factor that has an inclination to it post 2023. And that's really our overall financial strategy is to work the share count, rewards shareholders along the way, and then an inflection point in growth is what we're aiming for. That's our goal. Sure, Douglas, it's Jim. So I'll start with TR-3, which a just a microcosm of the larger picture. But an important one TR-3 gives you -- and I supply this jets. Similar ones, at least. It gives you a better cockpit display, a more processing for data in the airplane, and more data storage in the airplane. All good things for 21st Century warcraft. Although they are not essential to beginning the journey into networking that jet more closely with other systems and other platforms. So we're doing those two things parallel [inaudible 01:09:30] independent. TR-3 has also been delayed a bit. We're working with the [Indiscernible].  We feel we're on a common schedule now. We've got some significant supply chain issues that we've had to embed our own engineers into our suppliers to try to get them to perform. We're counting on them. That's important. But it's not going to deter or defer us from our goal of really developing the F-35 platform to be the aeronautics cornerstone of our architecture for 21st century warfare.  Because yes, once TR-3 is in, it will take another leapfrog up in data storage and data processing capabilities and networking capabilities which we will add. But we're already demonstrating how to do that with The hybrid base station that we actually flying a U-2 that provides that connectivity today with the Tech Refresh to equipment on the jet. So these things are related but not directed a differential or coterminous, they aren't be coterminous. We will get both of these jobs done, and the broadest program here, what we've -- I think derived by working with our government customers so far and understanding contracts and things is that, there won't be a overarching JADC2 of any kind.  What there will be is in reality in this business and I think in our customer construct, is that a technology roadmap and this has been developed more since maybe the last time you and I talked about this, Doug. But it's going to be a technology roadmap which is platform-by-platform connectivity using an open architecture set of standards and protocols that the whole industry can share. And we're going to be doing that one stage at a time. And what I want to do and I have been talking to our customers about at the most senior level is to provide every six to 12 months a mission capability by implementing this technology roadmap mission by mission.  Now we've got 14 missions and we've got 14 technologies coincidentally that we have completed three of those missions, which happened to be counterair, surface warfare, and integrated air and missile defense. We're showing customers those road maps and getting feedback on what platforms we should be tying together first, and getting those sensors, the decision making, command and control systems, and actual effectors connected in the most optimal way every 6-12 months. So we're moving out on both fronts [Indiscernible] is, again, associated, but not essential for moving out on the 21st Century Warfare Front. Sure, Greg. As I conclude the call today, I want to end by reinforcing our commitment to delivering long-term value to our shareholders here. While using our strong cash flow and robust Balance Sheet to do so, we're not shy about leverage, we're not shy about moving out with speed and with scale as we've talked about. Similarly, and again, along the way, we are going to work hard and invest to advance our customers important missions along the way. Those numbers are gone through around to 2 billion of CapEx and 1.5 billion of [inaudible 01:13:15] They're not incremental, they are up from our recent history, but they are not at an incremental 2 billion and incremental 1.5 billion just to be clear on that.  So I just want to make sure everybody knows our approach here. We're going to be positioning ourselves for growth inflection that we hope and expect to see a couple of years down the road. And by doing the share repurchase at the scale we're discussing in the timeframe we're looking at. The for sure valuation -- a value of that growth inflection should be amplified. That's our goal here. And thanks again for all of you for joining us on this call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in January. Thanks a lot."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "John Mollard",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. And good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of third quarter activity. Starting with sales, we recorded revenue of $16 billion. This result was below our expectation as we realized larger than anticipated supply chain impacts across Aeronautics, Missiles, and Fire Control in space. These impacts span multiple suppliers and our expectation is that we will incrementally recover from these disruptions over the next 12-18 months. Despite this reduction in sales volume, our segment operating profit increased year-over-year to $1.9 billion on strong operational performance across the enterprise.  Our earnings per share of $2.21 included a non-cash charge of $4.72 related to our previously announced pension transaction. We generated $1.9 billion in cash from operations and continued our practice of accelerating payment store supply chain with $1.5 billion and accelerated payments at quarter-end. The supply chain disruptions we experienced during the third quarter, underscore the fact that many of our suppliers are still dealing with the financial stress caused by the global pandemic. In addition, we continue to return substantial amounts of capital to our shareholders through both dividend payments and share repurchase activity.  And we have provided trending data for 2022, which we will discuss further in a few minutes. Turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. As we noted in our earnings release, our third quarter sales are below 2020 levels, primarily because of the re-nationalization of the atomic weapons establishment program in our space business area. Our third quarter sales also reflect recent supply chain delays, most notably on the F-35 production activity, and on several production programs within both Missiles and Fire Control and space.  Despite this reduction in sales volume, our third quarter segment operating profit is up from last year. A strong operational performance resulted in significant risk retirements across all four business areas. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the quarter. Our earnings per share of $2.21 incorporates a $4.72 non-cash charge associated with the $4.9 billion pension liability transfer we completed back in August. On an adjusted basis, our pre -transaction earnings per share of $6.93, was 11% higher than our 2020 results due to improved segment operating margins, reduced share account, and another quarter of mark-to-market gains across our Lockheed Martin Ventures portfolio.  While future volatility associated with investments in early-stage companies is expected, the significant gains realized across multiple holdings in our Ventures portfolio reinforce the value of investing in and partnering with companies focused on cutting-edge technologies. On Chart 6, we will look at our year-to-date cash generation and deployment. Subtracting our capital expenditures from almost $5 billion of cash from operations, our year-to-date free cash flow is greater than $4 billion. We've repurchased $2 billion of shares year-to-date, including $500 million during the third quarter, and have made more than $2 billion in dividend payments.  In total, our balanced cash deployment of nearly $4.2 billion represents over 100% of free cash flow return to our shareholders year-to-date. And we will continue these shareholder-friendly actions going forward as evidenced by our recent dividend increase and share repurchase program announcements. Moving onto Chart 7 in our 2021 guidance update, we've lowered our 2021 Outlook for sales and segment operating profit to reflect the previously discussed supply chain impacts that emerged in August and September. We've reduced our outlook for cash from operations primarily to reflect our updated plan to maintain our current $1.5 billion level of accelerated payments to our supply chain.  We plan to continue supporting our suppliers as they recover from pandemic related impacts, especially small and medium businesses both across the country and Internationally, to help maintain program schedules, and customer missions. The four-year outlook for earnings per share has increased $0.35 from the midpoint of last quarter's range, driven by Lockheed Martin Ventures investment gains and several non-operational items. Now, turning to Chart 8, we take a closer look at the current year revisions to 2021 sales by business area. As discussed, Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control and space have all been affected by lower than anticipated activity coming through our supply chain.  The level of reduction in supply chain activity over the past two months is higher than what we've been experiencing since the beginning of the pandemic and our 2021 Sales Outlook internationally assumes that we will see a return to more normal activity levels in the fourth quarter. In addition, our Sales Outlook for 2021, and our trending information for 2022 excludes any potential impacts associated with the recent Executive Order on safety protocols for Federal contractors. On Chart 9, we see segment operating profit tracking with the reduction in expected sales volume, and our expected segment operating margin outlook remains at 11%. On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our initial trending information for 2022.  We've estimated 2022 sales at approximately $66 billion, a decline of 1.5% from our projected 2021 results. As a reminder, the renationalization of our work and support the United Kingdom's atomic weapons establishment earlier this year, creates a headwind of just under $900 million on a year-over-year basis. We're expecting segment operating margins to remain at approximately 11% and we're projecting growth and cash from operations year-over-year to greater than, or equal to $8.4 billion. This Outlook assumes there will be no increase in tax payments related to capitalizing R&D costs. If current legislation is not amended, our cash from operations outlook could be reduced by up to $2 billion. Also, given we continue experiencing impacts across our supply chain, we now anticipate maintaining accelerated payments at the current $1.5 billion level through year-end 2022. Our prior multiyear cash forecast assume there would no longer be a need to accelerate payments to our supply chain beyond 2021. We are currently assuming a statutory corporate tax rate of 21% And we have not including any financial projections associated with closing the Aerojet Rocketdyne acquisition, which as Jim mentioned, is now expected to occur during the first quarter of 2022, subject to required regulatory approval. Turning to pension-related assumptions, interest rates have increased since year-end 2020. Our year-to-date actual returns have been higher than previously expected, and we've lowered our long-term rate of return to 6.5%.  In a response to investors asking for additional information on pension trends, we have included two charts on this topic in the appendix. These trends include no required pension contributions through 2025 based on current assumptions. On Chart 11, we outlined our expected capital deployment activities for 2022. We anticipate spending approximately $2 billion on capital projects next year, which represents an increase of approximately $300 million over expected 2021 levels. In addition, we anticipate investing approximately $1.5 billion on independent research and development activities, which represents a $200 million increase over planned 2021 levels. These investments are being made to enhance our delivery of critical systems and products to our customers as they execute their national security missions while ensuring we are well-positioned to compete for new business opportunities.  We will be making over $3 billion in dividend payments next year based on our recently announced $0.20 per share increase to our quarterly dividend rate. And as Jim shared earlier, we will also continue to strategically buy back shares when we believe they are trading below intrinsic value as they are now. We are planning to opportunistically repurchase up to $6 billion in shares over the next 12 to 18 months. We are confident we have the Balance Sheet flexibility and firepower to pursue all avenues of growth, while returning significant capital to our shareholders.  On chart 12, we provide some additional detail on our expected long-term trajectory for F-35 sales. As Jim commented earlier, we recently reached agreement with the Joint Program Office on our expected F-35 delivery plan. This joint plan represents the best intersection of production operations and supply chain capabilities. Technology insertion and supportive increasing mission requirements in both the timing and quantity of anticipated new production aircraft award decisions. We are very pleased with the outcome of this joint production replan as it provides stability and predictability across all key elements of this program.  Deliveries are expected to grow to a 156 aircraft by 2023 and will remain at that level for the foreseeable future. We are projecting F-35 production sales in 2022 will be lower than 2021 levels, and sales will also decline slightly in 2023. Revenues are expected to remain around 2023 levels throughout the balance of the forecasted timeframe. As we've previously discussed, the growth in F-35 sales volume will primarily be driven by sustainment activity as the number of deployed aircraft and associated flight hours grows rapidly, while we continue to aggressively pursue cost takeout in partnership with our customer.  Finally, we're also projecting modest growth and development activity as our customers continue seeking further advancements and capabilities for our unrivaled fifth-generation aircraft. To conclude on Chart 14, we have our summary. We've reduced our 2021 Outlook based on the higher-than-expected supply chain impacts we experienced during the third quarter. The supply chain and related production impacts, along with our updated F-35 production plan and the other factors Jim mentioned, have shaped our Outlook for 2022 and our future expectations.  Our strong Balance Sheet and cash generation give us multiple options to deploy cash and to echo Jim, we will prioritize investments, which will grow free cash flow per share. And with our broad portfolio, dedicated employees, strong Balance Sheet, and a disciplined in dynamic capital allocation strategy, we remain focused on our customers mission and long-term value creation for our shareholders. With that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A. Yeah. Thanks, Richard. It's John. I'll take both parts of that two-part question. So first, in regards to the assumptions in and around the budget vary based on. We're using the president's budget of $715 billion for the government fiscal year 2022 in the trending information we've given you. I'd say we're encouraged by the direction of the various committee markups as they reflect really good support for a number of our programs. And to your question about how much if any of this will come through in 2022, the answer to that question is going to be based on how much incremental funding is actually appropriated, how long it takes for that appropriated funding to end up getting on contract with us and us following that down to our supply chain.  And then the third factor is what specific programs the incremental appropriations are applied to. It's easier, obviously, to maintain programs at current run rates than it is to accelerate programs. So any programs that we're planning in a trend down would be really good candidates for being able to see opportunities in 2022 related to increased appropriations. I'll finish this action by saying, obviously, by the time we're in January when we're giving you an updated outlook for 2022, we should have a lot more clarity in and around the budgetary trends. Now, turning to your second part, which had to do with -- we'd previously given multiyear -- operating cash flow guidance and of course, all these metrics are going to be assuming the R&D tax change does not go into effect our prior guidance was like 89991.  You've seen we've got our guidance now at 83 for this year and 84 for next year. And I will say we anticipate higher than 84 operating cash flow guidance as we look ahead to 2023. But really the only factor that's changed since the multiyear guidance we gave before is in the level and the duration of the accelerated payments we're planning to make to our supply chain. I think I mentioned in the script, we have previously in that 89991 track assumed we would be accelerating $1.2 billion worth of accelerated payments of the supply chain at year-end -- at the end of this year.  But then the assumption was the pandemic would be behind us in 2022, we'd unwind that program, we'd end 2022 with no accelerated payments being made through our supply chain. Our current forecast, the 83 and 84 assumes we're at $1.5 billion of accelerated payments at the end of this year and $1.5 billion of accelerated payments at the end of 2022. So the pandemic impacts are behind us. Before we end year-end 2022, our guide of 84 would increase by that $1.5 billion. You're welcome, Rich. Good morning Rob. Yeah. Absolutely. So Rob, I mean, just to kind of put stop with what Jim was saying to give a little color. The four categories that Jim mentioned is scripted remarks, Hypersonics, classified growth and programs record and competitive new starts. When I look at that subset of revenue, for those 4 categories in 2021, it's in the neighborhood of $17 billion. Over the period growing out through for the next 5 years, that set of activity, assuming we hit our operational marks, assuming these programs continue on their programs of record, and we win our share of these competitive new business opportunities that we've talked about, that $17 billion worth of program revenue today will grow at about 9% compound annual growth rate, which gives me some level of comfort that the longer-term trends that Jim has talked about will hold just to reiterate.  We're expecting a slight decline in 22 and bounce back in 2023. And then I would say increasing growth and increasing growth rates going forward now. Yes. On the topic of margins, I think 11% is a good working target for us given the evolution in our portfolio and the activity that we see going forward. I just highlighted the four categories that we'll be seeing growth, a lot of those are new start programs. There is going to be some growth in programs are record which we would hope to turn into accretive margin program. But there is a lot of growth in new start areas, developmental areas. The good news is we will get -- there will be cost reimbursable contracts, will have assurance of recovery of the costs we're incurring.  But they by definition will be lower margin activities moving forward. And I should mention, and this is just to get this on the record early, there are certain classified activities that we can't talk about but if those programs continue to progress along the track that they're on, my expectation is we will be making investments in some of those programs out in the '23, '24, '25 timeframe that will be dilutive to margins. But I think in balance on 11% operating margin is a good metric for us. Yeah. Sure Mike, it's John. I'll take and I will talk semantically first through the four buckets and growth over time, and then maybe now, as good a time as any to talk specifically about what we're seeing in moving from '21 to '22 and they headwinds, but the four big buckets, the first one is Hypersonic activity. Today, we're doing about $1.5 billion worth of revenue in that area. If we are able to move a number of those activities into -- from development into production, which we fully expect will happen, we're making great progress on a number of them that are visible and are being reported on today. But our projection would be assuming a number of those activities proceed into a production environment, that billion-and-a-half dollars to gross highest $3 billion by 2026. The second area classified in -- I'll say upfront we hesitated even highlighting this, given there's not a lot that we can say in general about classified activity.  But because it is a large and growing component of our business, we thought it was important at least give you top-level trend information. And because, like I said, we will be making investments in some of this activity downstream, which will have dilutive impacts, I thought it was a good idea to talk about. But in aggregate our classified portfolio will grow, we expect at a rate above 5%, so that is a strong growing area for us. The programs of record which as Jim take through some of the big ones you mentioned will be CH-53K, F-35 sustainment.  The PAC-3 program, and then additional growth in the Fleet Ballistic Missile and evolutions and new advances in that program that portfolio today is worth about $8.5 billion. When we project out to 2026 over that period of time, the compound annual growth rate in that program set is like an 8% and it's highlighted by CH-53K, where we will be delivering out to a program of record of 200 units. I think the final deliveries are made in 2032, but just keeping that program on its program of record will go a long way towards us achieving that growth in the program of record, Greg just talked about.  And then the final area is the new business, which are a set of wildcards. You're going to get binary decisions in and around the FLRAA competition, the FARA competition. One of the new business areas that Jim talked about as next-generation interceptor. We successfully moved into a down select, where there's ourselves and one other competitor. We're making great progress. We've achieved a number of important program milestones recently, we feel good about where we're heading.  But that'll be a down select and then sort of the wildcard in the bunch. An opportunity we're very excited about is the KCY tanker program, where we've announced that we will be teaming with Airbus, who we think as a very capable frame for doing this mission. I think we bring extensive experience in the mission capabilities that would go onto that Air frame. I think we make a very formidable team. We're very excited about that opportunity. And depending on outcomes, I mean, obviously, we're doing next enough and either any of those programs besides the next-generation interceptor.  Yeah, that growth rate could be explosive. If we prevail on FLRAA and FARA, which we think we're very well-positioned to do, if we're down selected on NGI and a tanker program is awarded to us, there will be substantial growth in that bucket. And they headwinds, I guess like I said, now, let's tactically kind of walk through the 2021 outlook of roughly $67 billion and how that translates as we look ahead to 2022. Obviously you look at the math and we're down about a billion dollars.  The obvious large year-to-year headwind is related to the AWE re-nationalization, which I believe either Jim or I talked about, in our script is being a headwind of just under $900 million. The second headwind you'll see on our F-35 revenue chart, we're projecting a decrease in F-35 production related revenue up about $400 million moving from '21 to '22. And then we have two programs that are sort of in international lifecycle evolution, very successful programs, but they delivered out, and that's the Black Hawk helicopter program. And by delivered out, I mean, it's on the -- it's moving down from the peak. The number of helicopters we're going to deliver this year will be cut in half by the time we're two years out.  And then our highly successful next-generation OPI or program, both of those programs, moving from '21 to '22, if you combine the downtick in revenue, that aggregates to about $600 million. And then one of the other external factors was the recently announced and executed withdrawal of the U.S. military presence in Afghanistan. The primary impact to us is in a contract of special ops, logistics support program and we had some other Afghan draw down related impacts. In total it's about a $200 million a year-over-year headwind. But now as I pivot to the plus side, one of the programs, it's ramping up.  Year-over-year, is one of those in the -- I call it competitive category. We talked about the next-generation interceptor where we're doing about $200 million in revenue in 2021. We expect to do about $600 million of revenue in 2022. we have a lot of growth, as we mentioned within our classified activity. A lot of that activity is being done in our skunk works organization within aeronautics. That work is going to be growing about $400 million year-over-year. And a final large program, a record growth is in the CH-53K heavy lift, where we'd expect to see $300 million year-over-year growth. So on balance, it's down that the headwind is removal of the AWE activity we were doing. Sure, George. Thanks for the question. So if you go back to our first second quarter press releases that -- we probably haven't the year-to-date. AWE first quarter activity this year was $440 million, AWE activity in the second quarter was $435 million some those still you get the $875 million level of activity, we saw probably higher than what you might have remembered because you had a lot of wrap-up associated activity that took place, but say $875 million in 2021 that won't recur. And maybe what I'll do is do a high level sort of around the horn of how those the headwinds and tailwinds play out by segment.  The first segment we talked about is Aeronautics. As we look ahead to '22 we're expecting low single-digit growth rates in Aeronautics with a slight increase in margins, think of 10-20 basis point range. Within Missiles and Fire Control, we're actually expecting a slight decline, a low -- think of it as a low-single-digit decline with margins slightly lower than 2021 levels at again, 10 - 20 basis points. If you go to RMS, we're expecting a low single-digit decline as well, with margins maybe up to 40 basis points below what we going to end up with in 2021. And then finally at Space, we're expecting mid-single-digit declines. Obviously, that's where the AWE reduction takes place. With margins comparable to what we were expecting for 2021. Yeah. Pete, good question. And I think a large part of the impact that our supply chain is facing our, in our suppliers that are dual use. I mean, they're supplying to both commercial aerospace and defense. So if we're looking at parts of the supply chain that are strictly defense, they're probably not nearly as stress financially as our dual use suppliers, people that don't make landing gear for us and they'll make landing gear for commercial aircraft, they make brakes.  Those are the suppliers that have fixed operating costs that have seen substantial revenue decreases on the commercial supply on that have really caught in to their operating cash flow. And we think it's the right thing to do. We have access to capital, we have access to cash at extremely good rate. We generate a lot of cash flow. It's in -- as Jim said, it's in the industry's interest, it's in our customers interest, and frankly, there is an element of self-preservation here, we need our supply chain to be successful for us to be successful. So while it's voluntary, it's not a 100% Altria. I mean, we need to make commitments. We need especially our dual use vendors and partners, our supply chain partners to be successful for the long term. And Ron, this is John. Just to pile on to what Jim said. He's done a very good job of articulating a strategy from an external perspective, but as guided spend with this Company for over 30 years, what I most see and resonate with is how gyms actively change in the culture across Lockheed Martin internally. To embrace any kind of innovative technology, despite where they come from we've had allowed of really bright creative scientists and engineers, but we don't have to invent the solution to every single problem. And historically we've struggled with some level of not-invented-here, which probably may come as no surprise to somebody yet.  What Jim has been stressing and our team is getting is, we need to identify and partner with whoever does have the best solution in an industry agnostic manner. And I think we're doing a pretty good job of that in our ventures, investment fund, where we're going to startups, and seeing the art of the possible. We're starting to get pull demand from the business areas for some of these technologies, which I personally view as a huge step in the right direction. And it's drive in that mindset, the openness to technology across the entire R&D and engineering community. So I haven't seen a change and I appreciate the direction from an internal perspective. Yes. Let me make sure we're tracked, and the prior guide was [Indiscernible] and 9. Today, we're doing [Indiscernible], and in that [Indiscernible] is a billion-and-a-half that was not there. So we're up $300 million. I'm telling you, today, our [Indiscernible] is going to be higher -- will be higher than [Indiscernible] in 2023. Depending on how much we still have to accelerate in 2023, are that number can be anywhere from a billion dollars higher to $100 million higher or $200 million higher. So the punch line is if you think about the two years, '21 and '22 were ahead, dependent on the outcome of where COVID is and either '22 or '23, we could be equal to or slightly behind the prior multiyear guidance if that makes sense. Right. Yes. Just to make sure we're on 100% the same baseline. The old guidance was 89, 90, 91. Today, let's just use as a baseline 83, 84 and 85, that's down $1.8 billion. If we're at 85, we've got over a billion dollars of assumed advances at the end of 2023. So you could say notionally, where we're sitting here today over the three-year period were down $800 million and some of that is driven by what I've now assumed in terms of -- we have an internal term. It's funding that we are authorization spending we do in advance of contract turn - ons based on history, there's a high likelihood that some of these programs on a shift from development to production, but customer funding profiles aren't going to align with need dates. we are anticipating that we will be carrying a substantial amount of costs associated with that transition. Hey, Cai, it's John, I'll take that. If you look at our operating cash flow and free cash flow or net debt retirements over the -- I'll stick to the first three years of the plan. Our excess cash balances would allow us to do the $6 billion we're talking about and still have enough liquidity to run the business, so that's point 0.1. The $6 billion is just deploying what would otherwise have been set in my bank account, earning 25 basis points. That's 0.1. 0.2 with AJRD, our original expectation was, we were probably finance call it 3 billion of the 4.5 and used cash for the other 1.5 billion. I'm leaning now towards, especially given how low financing rates are, maybe financing the entire acquisition.  But kind of more broadly, the way I think about acquisitions and I know Jim and I are absolutely in a 100% violent agreement on this. If you can find M&A that has the right operational fit, the right culture fit, and the right strategic fit, M&A pays for itself. I mean, it's free. You have to finance some upfront but if it's a good deal, you're going to get your money back very quickly. So I view like Jim does, M&A is not a drain on your Balance Sheet. Our Balance Sheet, as you know, is single A. Our metrics would support a higher rating.  We're a minus for the two that do use the A minus scale. Conversations I've been having was it's hard to justify why we're in A minus instead of a flat A. The punch line is we've got a tremendous amount of firepower. If as Jim talked about the discipline and dynamic capital allocation process says, we need to put additional resources in here, there or wherever. We're going to have the ability to do that. Hello. It's John. I'll take the question. I would characterize the '21 to '22 headwinds as maybe being unique to us in some regards, although companies have a lot of exposure or had a lot of exposure to Afghanistan, for example. They may have similar headwinds. But I'd say the '21 to '22 headwinds are maybe confined to us, but the out-year growth, I think when I looked at the last track on the President's Budget, the growth rate was 2%. A year for government fiscal year '23, '24, '25 and out. I see that as a center point. Again, if we're able though, to prevail in competitions, I see a path for us to grow faster than that rate. We need to perform on our programs, we need to deliver helicopters and airplanes on our committed schedules, and if we do that, I see upside to the 2% growth that's in the President's budget. Thanks, Sheila. Yes. Thanks, Sheila. I think its growth and opportunities across the big four categories that Jim has articulated. A lot of our potential upside in 2023 is going to come from programs that are right now in operational testing, assuming they're able to achieve success through that, those test programs they are going to migrate into production. In the period where you still have an overlap between development and production that's where you're going to start seeing some bulge and that kind of transition ties into the probably to extended discussion how with Myles, about if you look out at the 2023 year yield, you acumen to three years while you slightly down from the last guide.  I think we're going to be successful, we're going to need to bridge those programs to maintain their critical schedule, so we're going to carry a financial backstop against them. But there is absolutely no doubt the growth is going to come out of hypersonics, classified and growth in the programs are record. I mean, Jim mentioned PAC-3 growing 200 million going from '21 to '22. In '21 we're going to deliver 350 routes, were going to be delivering 500 in 2023 and 550 million in 2025. So PAC-3 growth is going to be very strong in that period of time and CH-53K really starts levering. And if we -- when we prevail on the Future Vertical Lift Program, you will see an inflection point as well. You're welcome Sheila."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJames Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I will begin my remarks this morning with a few comments on our financial results, which Ken will elaborate on in a few minutes. Our second quarter sales increased 5% over last year's second quarter as each business area exceeded 2020 levels led by our Space team. Our Space business grew over 10% this quarter due to growth in hypersonics, Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared or OPIR satellite activities, and increased support provided to the U.K Ministry of Defense's Atomic Weapons Establishment program, which will close out our management of that activity. Our segment operating profit was impacted this quarter by a one-time charge associated with a classified program in our Aeronautics business area. While the classified nature of this program precludes us from discussing this matter in depth, we can say that our customer is highly attracted to the capabilities that we\u2019re developing on their behalf that we're committed to delivering these capabilities and that the long-term potential of this solution is significant for the company. Our cash generation remains strong, driving $1.3 billion of cash from operations this quarter after making $1.4 billion of accelerated payments to our supply base as we continue to mitigate the risks brought on by COVID-19 for our supply chain. Our cash generation and the strength of our balance sheet gave us the ability to complete a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement this quarter, in addition to the $1 billion ASR executed last quarter, thereby bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $1.5 billion. We remain confident in our ability to continue driving strong cash generation and supporting balanced cash deployment actions, including investing in key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities and returning cash to shareholders. Turning to budgets, the White House submitted their fiscal year 2022 budget proposal to Congress requesting $715 billion for the Department of Defense, an $11 billion increase from the FY '21 enacted budget. Our programs continue to be well supported, including over $12 billion for the F-35 program, approximately $3.5 billion for our signature Sikorsky helicopters, and over $2 billion for hypersonics programs. The President's budget request prioritizes funding for innovation and modernization as well, in recognition of the need to invest in technologies and capabilities to address the great power competition the nation now faces. These include areas of strength within the Lockheed Martin portfolio such as continued support for Air and Missile Defense programs, THAAD, PAC-3, and our recent next-generation interceptor award; space domain initiatives including OPIR, and GPS III satellites, and the space development agency's Transport Layer Architecture. The Defense Department request also focused on investments in advanced capability enablers. We believe this vision of deterrence and innovation is well aligned with our broad portfolio in our 21st Century Warfare vision. In Congressional March to-date of the FY '22 defense budget request, we continue to see strong support from the hill for all of our programs, which include increases for F-35, C-130, CH-53K, and UH-60 programs and fully approved budget requests for many of our other systems. Turning to some strategic and operational achievements in this quarter, I'd like to begin by highlighting the company's participation in Northern Edge 21, a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command exercise in support of the Pacific deterrence initiative. This live exercise included multiple U.S military services across a very wide geographic area, with a goal of enhancing joint interoperability between the services and the various domains that they operate in. Signature programs from all four of our business areas participated in this event, and we successfully demonstrated joint all-domain command and control known as JADC2. We demonstrated capabilities such as enhanced situational awareness by integrating sensors across land, sea, air, and space, for example. Among our successful demonstrations during -- of JADC2 during the exercise was one, enabling Aegis and PAC-3 MSE integration for an integrated air and missile defense against advanced threats; also using the F-35 to provide real-time tracking and targeting data generated near San Diego during a flight to the All Domain Operations Center in Alaska for prosecution and fire control; also facilitating space-based connectivity at the same time, using the MUOS narrowband satellite communications constellation; and also supporting the Air National Guard's demonstration of a new data link capability with our Legion Pod, which integrates our infrared search and track targeting sensor technology into that broader network. The Northern Edge exercise demonstrated our integrated offensive and defensive fires capability, our satellite communication links, as well as the ability to adapt joint battle management concepts in real time. One of my goals in the first year as CEO of Lockheed Martin was to actually demonstrate the benefits of network effects to our customers using existing platforms under our 21st century warfare concept. Our integrated performance in Northern Edge did exactly that, and we're just getting started. Moving to some specific business area highlights. In Aeronautics, Switzerland's Federal Council announced its decision to purchase 36 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing or CTOL aircraft, along with sustainment and training services as part of their Air2030 modernization program. This is a significant win for Lockheed Martin with an initial value of $5.5 billion and a total value of approximately $15 billion over 30 years. The F-35 was selected over the F-18, the Rafale, and the Eurofighter because of its survivability, information superiority, and comprehensively network systems. The Swiss Council also noted that the F-35 delivered outstanding value offering both the lowest procurement and operational costs across all those competing aircrafts. Switzerland will become the 15th nation to join the program since its inception, and we're excited to welcome them into the F-35 community. In Rotary and Mission systems, the U.S Navy awarded our Sikorsky team a contract for nine CH-53K heavy lift helicopters for production Lot 5, which is worth nearly $900 million, and we're continuing to drive cost down and provide reduced unit prices to our customer. The award also included the option for nine additional King Stallion aircraft for Lot 6, which when those are exercised would represent over $1.9 billion in order for the Lot 5 and 6 combined. Including the previous Lot 5 award we received, orders for 33 53K's out of a Navy program record of 200. So, a long way to go over 80% of domestic aircraft quantities are still in front of us, and interest from international customers is driving additional opportunities. Also in RMS, our C6ISR team participated in a unique collaboration with the Air Force to integrate critical battle management capabilities from our command and control legacy product, The Theater Battle Management Control System or TBMCS into the Air Force's new Kessel Run All Domain Operations Suite. The TBMSC -- TBMCS was first declared a system of record in 2000 and performs the planning and execution of air missions, interfacing with many other operations, intelligence, and C2 systems throughout the U.S armed services. Our RMS team delivered a cloud-based architecture and delivery plan to enhance capabilities and migrate TBMCS data into the Kessel Run operation suite in support of pilots and commanders executing joint air campaigns. So another example of our 21st century work fair concept and action with our Air Force customer in this case. In Missiles and Fire Control, our integrated Air and Missile Defense line of business delivered the first PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement or MSE interceptors to Sweden, providing a country with the world's most advanced air defense capabilities to defend against incoming threats. Sweden now becomes one of 10 international customers to choose PAC-3 MSE missiles. In addition, our Space business area successfully launched two new satellites in support of critical national security space objectives. Our fifth Space Based Infrared System and Geosynchronous Earth Orbit or SBIRS GEO-5 satellite successfully deployed from its United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket and is now communicating with the operations team from the U.S space force. SBIRS GEO-5 is the latest satellite to join the space forces orbiting early warning missile constellation and its equipped with powerful surveillance sensors to support ballistic missile defense, and expand technical intelligence gathering and bolster situational awareness for the guardians that are defending the U.S and its allies. The SBIRS GEO-5 satellite is the first military satellite built on an LM 2100 Combat Bus. That's a more resilient, modernized and modular space vehicle originally developed using Lockheed Martin internal investment. Also the fifth Global Positioning System or GPS III satellite was also successfully launched this quarter. The GPS III Space Vehicle 5 is the 31st operational GPS satellite in the constellation with significant advancements over previous GPS Space Vehicles, including three times better accuracy and improved anti-jamming capabilities. The GPS III and OPIR satellite constellations are both Lockheed Martin's signature programs and represent key elements of our network centric 21st century warfare concept. And lastly, our space business area was selected by NASA to build spacecraft for two separate missions to Venus. Lockheed Martin will design, build and operate the VERITAS orbiter to investigate the surface and subsurface of Venus, and the DAVINCI+ vehicle to research the planet's atmosphere. These missions build on our legacy Magellan program for the exploration of Venus and will represent NASA's first return to the planet in more than three decades. These achievements from across the company highlight our focus on providing innovative solutions, and the strength that our broad portfolio gives us to support our customers missions and their all domain objectives. I'll close my remarks today with a quick status on the strategic acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne that we announced last December, a transaction that we believe will enhance Lockheed Martin's as well as all of industry's ability to meet our future national security and civil space objectives when it comes to propulsion. We are committed to achieving the key DoD priorities of reducing cost, increasing the quality and speed of new products, in addition to enhancing Aerojet Rocketdyne's position as a leading merchant supplier to all of industry. We remain in the process of responding to the Federal Trade Commission's second request for information, which we received earlier in the year, a step in the review process that we'd expected. We continue to engage with the FTC and Department of Defense stakeholders regularly as part of their review, and pending approval, we hope to -- and expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Ken.\nKen Possenriede: Hey, thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts that we have included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3, and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw solid growth in sales and earnings per share. Segment operating profit was comparable to last year's second quarter total due to the $225 million impact of a classified aeronautics program, while cash from operations was $1.3 billion exceeding our expectations for the quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, cash return to shareholders exceeded 100% of free cash flow as we executed another $500 million of share repurchases in addition to $721 million of dividends paid. Despite the issue of a single contract, we were able to increase our outlook for earnings per share and hold our full year outlook for all other key financial metrics. Turning to Chart 4, we compare ourselves and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Second quarter sales grew 5% compared with 2020 to $17 billion, continuing our expected growth of the business, while segment operating profit remains at approximately $1.8 billion comparable to last year's results. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the second quarter of 2021. Our earnings per share of $6.52 was $0.73 above our results last year driven by volume, reduced share count and higher FAS/CAS income. On Chart 6, we will look at our cash generation and distributions for the second quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.3 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was $950 million. By executing additional share repurchases of $500 million in the second quarter as well as providing our dividend of $2.60 per share, we were able to generate -- excuse me, we're able to return 129% of free cash flow to our stockholders this quarter. Moving on to Chart 7. As we noted, we are increasing our outlook for earnings per share and holding our outlook for sales segment operating profit and cash from operations. Looking at Chart 8, we are increasing the sales outlook for RMS by $150 million. And that's primarily driven by volume at Sikorsky as well as a $25 million increase at our space business area and combined offset the downward adjustment in aeronautics, keeping total sales consistent with our prior guidance. In our Chart 9, we show the increased segment operating profit range for RMS, Missiles and Fire Control and Space, also offsetting the impact realized at Aeronautics, which allowed us to hold our guidance for the year, and we will continue to pursue cost takeout and margin improvement opportunities across the corporation On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our update to the guidance for 2021 earnings per share. Program performance and continued cost takeout offset our impact at Aeronautics, and we also saw improvements to earnings per share from investments and other non-operational items, along with the benefit of our continued share repurchases. To conclude on Chart 11, we have our summary. We continue to see sales growth year-over-year as well as strong operational cash performance, while still accelerating cash to our supply chain to meet commitments vital to our national security. And, as noted, we have increased our full outlook for earnings per share and are holding all other key metrics as we look ahead to the second half of 2021. And with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And first with the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Harned: Thank you. Good morning.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning.\nDouglas Harned: Jim, I wanted to see if you could describe some of the things that would likely drive growth at Lockheed Martin. You talked some about the budget, but we're now in a fairly flat budget environment and Lockheed Martin's revenues have moved higher, but the backlog has really not grown during the last 18 months, as some legacy programs have naturally flattened. You highlighted some good growth areas like hypersonics and Space. But when you look at the next 5 years, do you believe you can get the mid-single-digit, say top line growth in this environment, particularly given flat recent backlogs. I mean basically what should we look for that could take backlogs higher and drive enough growth to offset potential declines in mature programs?\nJames Taiclet: Good morning, Doug. With the resurgence of great power competition with China and Russia, the defense enterprise overall is at an inflection point. And when I say defense enterprise, I mean government, military, and industry. It needs to change. And where I think I can address your question is during that period of change, and it's very important and critical that we started now that Lockheed Martin is in a position with its breadth of platforms and systems and its cutting edge technology to both drive and benefit from that needed change. And so, yes, over the next 5 years, we're going to strive for mid-single-digit growth, and I'm energized and enthusiastic about working with our government military leaders, which we've already started. And with our defense sector and telecom and technology sectors, partners that we're going to have in the future to do this. And I'm convinced that our shareholders are going to benefit from our leadership here. We're going to benefit in a couple ways, and one of them is going to be by enhancing the value of our legacy programs, including the obvious F-35 is a much valuable, more valuable platform when you take advantage of the network effect that it can deliver by connecting sensors across domains, adding 5G.mil capability to our comm system so that we can communicate with satellites directly, etcetera, you end up getting a whole network effect with a value to the defense enterprise and the deterrent value is going to go up by implementing this across our technology roadmap over the next number of years, our existing systems. So, I'm very energized about the growth prospect. I think we have a uniquely positioned capability to drive it and that we've got a unique capability to interact with commercial industry in a whole number of sectors to help it happen.\nDouglas Harned: If I can follow-up on that, when you talk about the inflection point, is this something that we should be looking for with respect to what Congress is doing, what the administration is doing or is it already embedded in the budget because the budget doesn't seem to set up for a lot of growth as it stands right now.\nJames Taiclet: The inflection point of need is here, Doug, but the system we will work within does not move abruptly, let's say. So it's got to migrate over a period of time in its way, if you will, and Congress will have a part in that. It's going to be a little bit more deliberate as far as the budget turns out. But within that budget, we intend to make our products, platforms, and services the leading edge and therefore the most attractive ways to allocate that budget in all the domains that we serve. So, we're actually not expecting our 21st century warfare concept to get funded independently. Rather, we're going to use that to make our current and future platforms way more competitive, way more attractive, use a network effect to get more value for money for the government and see how the budget can shift our way, depending on -- and in fact, irrespective of how much the top line grows. Let me ask Ken to follow-up on that.\nKen Possenriede: Hey, Doug, if I could, I will give -- I will just give you a little more color that'll hopefully complement what Jim said. So, if you think about our portfolio and where we are and where we're going, so F-35, rough numbers 27%, 28% of our portfolio and you think about where we are and where we're going with that program. So we're right now for production in the midst of our product -- what's called a production rebaseline. And that's basically due to COVID and trying to get our technology Refresh 3 on Lot 15 and Block 4 onto Lot 16. The customer -- the joint program office is working with all the key constituents to look at what makes sense. As you recall, this year we're going to deliver anywhere from 133 to 139 aircraft. What makes sense next year and into the next couple years to make sure we maximize when we put that key technology on that aircraft. So, you're going to likely see once that gets revealed, and hopefully it'll be -- we'll be able to reveal that with the customer when we give trend data in October, but it's likely to show the plateau of production slightly pushed out to the right but also elongating, if you will. So I think at least in the next couple of years, there is likely some opportunity there from a production standpoint. There is definitely opportunity for us in sustainment if you think about it, only roughly 40%, 50% of the bases are stood up. So, we still have a lot of work to do there. We're also going to have many more aircraft in the fleet in the next couple of years. Think of in the next couple of years, we're going to have over 1,000 aircraft in the fleet which are going to require more sparing, that modernization I just talked about working with the customer, we're also going to have to modernize some aircraft to put this new technology on aircraft that are already in the fleet. So that's one area. Sticking with that -- excuse me, sticking with Aeronautics, you have F-16 which is an international play that we have a backlog of 128 aircraft that is going to continue to grow top line as will Skunk Works. That's going to become a larger part of the Aeronautics platform. And just sticking internationally, we see strong demand for our integrated Air Missile Defense products. If you look at our helicopter programs, we're just starting to deliver CH-53 aircraft program, a record of 200 plus to the Israelis, hopefully, it'll be a couple other countries that have an interest in that platform. And then there's future vertical lift, which will give us a huge uplift in the middle of this decade going forward when we win those programs. And then there's Space. You mentioned hypersonics, that is going to be a nice complimentary part of that portfolio. I agree, it's not going to dramatically move the needle, but you're going to have those programs go into production in the middle of this decade, which will give us some uplift and then National Security Space, whether it's classified OPIR, NGI, we'll see some strong growth there. So we feel pretty good. Complementing what Jim said, we feel pretty good about our prospects going forward.\nOperator: Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much and good overall quarter, given the classified issue. So you did a -- an ASR in the quarter. And then you had this classified adjustment. Did you know at the time, you did the ASR, this would happen? Because I would have thought, if you saw it coming, you would have waited to do the ASR.\nKen Possenriede: Hey, Cai. Good morning. Good to talk to you. This is Ken. I will take that. So if you think about when we did the ASR, we basically put that in place the day after, we were allowed to trade again, which would have been a day after earnings. And as I mentioned before, if you look at the large amount of cash that we have, our thought back then and it still remains today, we continue to have that cash on our balance sheet. And we believe we're going to continue to have that after Aerojet Rocketdyne, we're going to remain in the market. That was our thought process in April, when we did the $500 million ASR. We're highly likely based on where our stock price is trading today. We're going to enter the market again as soon as we're able to -- may not be an ASR, but we're going to go into the open market and buy back more stock, it just absolutely makes sense to do that. Regarding when we knew about the charge, that basically happened in the May time period. It became clear, based off from a process standpoint, Cai, we had a joint customer, Lockheed Martin review to do a deep dive on the program. And then we also did one, that was Lockheed Martin only to provide an additional assurance function. So we've done a very thorough assessment of the situation and that was done in the May time period. And in fact, in the June time period, we reported out to our Board, so Jim, myself, and Frank St. John, our COO, reported out to the Board and we also had what's called a classified business and security committee meeting, and we actually owe them a comeback in September. So that all initiated in May, we're very comfortable with the charge. Just to give a little bit of a flavor of that $225 million, that is for the development portion of this program. Think of that as roughly 40% of that cost has already occurred and the other 60% is embedded in the new estimate to complete. So we're not assuming that this program goes forward with the current the -- excuse me, the prior ETC. It is a new estimate to complete with that over on embedded. So we think we have a good handle on that. And from a timing standpoint, it was after the ASR was put in place.\nOperator: Our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hey, good morning, everybody.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning, Noah.\nNoah Poponak: Ken, maybe you can just -- I know it's classified and you said there's only so much detail you can provide. But any incremental color you could give on what exactly happened, where the performance -- what type of performance issue it is? And you're -- how you're confident, it doesn't linger. And then, just folding that into the total Aeronautics segment margin, the revised annual segment EBIT guidance for the segment implies that margin picks right back up, even to above where it was pre 2Q. How do you do that with the reset number on this program plus I think you mentioned in the release F-35 margin didn't go up. So any color you can provide on where the segments margin goes from here?\nKen Possenriede: You bet. So, yes, let's first talk about the classified program. And I'll assure you know, and for everybody on the call, what we are able to say we've got approval from the customer. And hopefully, I've given you guys enough experience where I'll be as transparent as I can. But on this there's only so much we could say. So, as I answered to Cai's question, no, we've done a lot of independent reviews. We've done reviews with the customer. We think today based on all the information we have, it's a development contract that we believe will be successful from a schedule and performance standpoint, and then ultimately will turn into production -- a production program. And we also believe there are additional opportunities out there. And I'll assure you, we believe, I could say this, that there is still a very strong business case, given these associated opportunity. So this will be a great program for our customers. And I'm talking about all the customers out there that are going to utilize this and it'll be a good program for the Lockheed Martin Corporation. Regarding Aeronautics, Noah, you've got it right. For the second half of the year, we're basically assuming a little bit over 11% return on sales. And think of that as it's got to be primarily F-35. It will be -- from that standpoint, we are assuming some risk retirement on some production programs. I have mentioned in the past on the Block 5 we have taken a pause on risk retirements until we see improved performance there probably next year. But there are other lots out there. Back to the comments we made about our cost takeout initiatives, cost competitive niches, and our strong performance in other parts of the portfolio. We believe F-35 production, there's other opportunities out there for us to have risk retirements. F-16, we'll also see some improvement as we'll see 130. So I think you got that right. Aeronautics, we feel comfortable being around 11% or a little bit above 11% return on sales for the second half of the year.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hi, good morning, Jim. Good morning, Ken.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning.\nKen Possenriede: Hi.\nKristine Liwag: Maybe switching gears, directed energy has been one of the key areas of advanced capabilities that the DoD has highlighted as an important category. How meaningful is it that the Navy is fielding the HELIOS and the DDG 51 Arleigh Burke? How much of a contributor could this be to long-term top line growth maybe in the next 5 years? And also, how far away are we until we see miniaturization of this kind of technology where you could deploy it on a platform like the F-35?\nKen Possenriede: So -- hey, Kristine, it's Ken. I'll take that one. So, yes, we are in the thick of that with the contracts that you described. And we're very pleased with the performance we've had on these programs. And we're also pleased where we think the customers going. I think we'll see a dramatic increase with our involvement, but you have to put that in perspective relative to the size of what it is. But it will be accretive from a top line standpoint. It's just for a $68 billion company that will continue to grow, at least in the next 5 years. Kristine, it's not going to be a -- I'd say, a material impact. In terms of miniaturization, we're working that with the customer. I think based on what we've seen, we're some ways away from that though. But we will give you an update when there is one to give.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Ken, it might be another one for you. Can you talk about the second half trends implied on cash flow to get to that $8.9 billion -- greater than $8.9 billion, obviously that would imply materially better than you've ever done in the second half. And then similarly, if you can just color the backlog, is it -- do you have confidence you can get back to that 147, 150 level is the F-35 progressing such that those will actually close this year. Just color on those two things. Thanks.\nKen Possenriede: You're right. So Myles, we've done for the first half of the year a little over $3 billion, which would tell you we've -- we need to do $6.9 billion. And based on what I'm seeing the lion share of that -- I'm not giving you much comfort, but once I finish, I will hopefully the lion share of that $6.9 billion is in the fourth quarter. And really the driver there is we're in the midst and a lot of this is due to COVID. We're in the midst of renegotiating, if you will, the timing and the amounts of performance based payments on the F-35 program that's specifically Block 5. We're working through that now. And if you look at January 1 to the end of the second quarter, rough numbers, our contract assets grew by roughly $1.9 billion. The lion share of that is F-35 and the lion share of that is performance-based payments; timing, if you will, of when we liquidate that for F-35. We believe we're on a path with the customer to close on that. This is the third quarter to close it -- close on that in the third quarter. And just to give you a little more color, we think -- excuse me, we think contract assets are going to grow another $500 million in the third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter and most of that will be before December to give you some comfort, we will be liquidating contract assets to the point where we only see contract assets growing in total by an immaterial amount, they will still come down quite a bit and that's driven by the fourth quarter. And most of that is driven by Aeronautics. There is some work that needs to be done from a cash collection standpoint at RMS as well. But the lion share of that is Aeronautics. And we feel really bullish miles about the $8.9 billion of cash from ops for this year. In terms of backlog, I think we've already stated that. So you've got Lot 15, that we thought for F-35 that we thought would settle last year. We believe it's now going to settle this year. There's just a lot of complications going on and we think the joint program office working with all the constituents, it has a very difficult job, but they're doing a really great job of coordinating what the demands and the needs are of the services plus the international customers. We think that'll close in the third quarter. But because of that we have little to no comfort that Lot 16 is going to close this year. So we're actually out looking that to close next year. And that that's a sizable order. It's just timing, which means right now we're forecasting backlog to end this year at about $143 billion. So we're actually going to erode backlog this year. But again, I'll stress that's all timing. And for Lockheed Martin, we've gotten enough advanced funding on those Lots for 15 and 16, where it is not an impact to us. It'll just be optically a reduction in backlog.\nOperator: Our next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Yes. Good morning, Jim and Ken.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning.\nPeter Arment: Hey Jim question, I guess on sticking on F-35, maybe can you touch upon just maybe the investments that Lockheed is making to reduce sort of the lifecycle costs of F-35 and do you expect to increase any of your internal spending, just given the sustainment discussion continues to grow louder, and I guess in front of your potential, PBL contract with the Air Force? And maybe, Ken, if you could just touch upon when you think that PBL contract could come into play as well?\nJames Taiclet: Sure. We've spent about $500 million to date in investments to improve the sustainability cause of the F-35 there, Peter. And we'll continue to make reasonable investments as we go forward. But there's a perspective that I can give you from a former Air Force pilot, because operationally and on the line, where the pilots and the commanders are flying the jets and defending the country and doing the missions, there's actually a lot of good things happening, and they'll tell you this themselves. But first of all, you can go to the performance metrics, meaning that flight hour between failure metric, when can you expect to fly the jet before you've got to get a spare airplane that day. It's nearly double the contractual requirement. And so the pilots when they get an assignment from the tail number for a mission, on any given day, they're twice as likely to get in that airplane and fly the mission as they are in any other fourth gen plane. On top of that, it's about twice as reliable as a fourth generation fighter. And meanwhile, the labor hours of maintenance needed for each of those flight hours is about two-thirds of the contractual requirements. So if you get out to bases, and talk to commanders who have either in their wings, F-35s and other aircraft, or they've commanded different squadrons of different types of aircraft, they'll tell you that for the frontline performance in the area of operations, if you will, the F-35 is sort of head and shoulders above legacy aircraft. In fact, the Air Force had about 18 months in CENTCOM recently, where they just got back from that tour, if you will. They had 1,300 sorties with F-35s, and the mission capable rate was all -- it was nearly 75%, sometimes 80% to 90%, any given week. And that's really, really strong, haven't been out and done this before, I can tell you that that's top shelf. Now, on the other hand, the affordability we need to address and I've met with each of the service chiefs and the chairman to implore all of us to work together on this. Lockheed Martin with that $500 million investment over the last few years has taken about 40% of the cost that we can control out of our purview, if you will. Already, we're going to shoot for another 40% over the next 5 years, but somehow 40% keeps coming up. We're only about 40% of the total cost. So 60% is propulsion and military government cost. If we don't have an all-in strategy together to address this we are not going to hit the goals. And so, again, when I meet with the chiefs and the chairman, and hopefully soon with the service chiefs, we will all get together on a tiger team and address this in the only way it can be successfully addressed as an integrated team. So that's how we're going to approach it. I do agree with the team at Aeronautics that there is a way to get this cost per flying hour on an A model of 25,000 an hour, but it's got to be an all-in approach. And we're going to keep doing our part, of course. But we\u2019re -- I'm personally involved in trying to pull the wider team together to get that done.\nKen Possenriede: So, Peter, just based on timing, based on what Jim just said, we are starting to see a lot of interest. If you recall, we issued a white paper that described how we would drive down the costs, we described how industry would sign up to service level agreements. And as Jim mentioned, we are making great progress with the energy industry consortium. And we do think we have Pratt Whitney from a propulsion standpoint and the services fully engaged now. And we believe we're going to soon be responding to an RFP. They're going to take a lot of the key pieces out of our white paper for us then to what I'll call answer a conventional request for proposal. And we're hopeful that early next year, we industry could be under contract for some type of performance based logistics concept. And I'll just remind you that this is likely not going to be a top line enhancement play for us. That that's probably all embedded. But assuming the industry is incentivized to hit these targets or to over achieve these targets, it could potentially be a return on sales play for us.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning.\nDavid Strauss: The -- in the fiscal '22 budget, the next-gen air dominance program saw a nice plus up. Can you talk about the role you're playing on that program, whether that work is all classified at this point, or not? And then, I guess, Ken, could you also touch on the R&D tax amortization issue, where that stands? Is there been any movement potentially done to do that? Thanks.\nJames Taiclet: Sure. I'll take both. Yes, unfortunately, David, NGAD, everything about NGAD is classified. The only thing I will say is you've heard the customers, the DoD say that F-35 is not going to be a build pair of NGAD. And I still think that's still the answer out there which is good news for the -- our great fifth gen aircraft. But unfortunately everything else regarding NGAD is classified and we can't discuss what our role or not our role is. Regarding the amortization of R&D, we're still working with a lot of our constituents. When we come out with trend data in October, David, our tax experts are telling us unfortunately at that time, it's likely not to be settled. So it is likely we will offer trend data for '22. That would -- right now what we see is assuming this issue goes away or gets deferred and does not impact '22 cash, we see $9 billion or greater of cash from operations next year. So we're in the midst of going through our long range plan. So hopefully we'll be able to reaffirm that. But we're also -- then also going to have to state that right now what we see is this amortization issue was a $2.1 billion impact to cash in '22. We're hopeful that this thing either gets deferred out 5 years, that's one scenario we're hearing. I mean, what we'll see where it goes, or it gets repealed, or it is interpreted differently than the way we industry are interpreting. And it really is just what I'll call conventional independent research and development for us, which would be rough numbers, a $300 million impact rather than a $2.1 billion impact. But regardless, Lockheed Martin sees a path forward for us to continue generating strong cash this year and into the next couple years. And we'll use that for our internal and organic inorganic investments for our employees, and then give a fair amount back to our shareholders.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRobert Spingarn: Hey, good morning.\nJames Taiclet: Hey.\nRobert Spingarn: Jim, when I listened to DoD, I hear them talk a lot about open architecture solutions and finding ways to be less locked into the contractors. But in listening to your answer to Doug's question before you spoke a fair amount about network effects, which some might view as another form of locking. So can you talk a bit about that tension, whether you think it's there. And if so, how Lockheed resolves to deliver both the vision that you've articulated, while also meeting DoD's broader desires?\nJames Taiclet: Sure. Rob, the two things are completely compatible and my recent experience has been that telecom and tech industry where it was essential that open architecture be the baseline, or the foundation, if you will, for 4G and 5G network development in telecom, for example. So our approach is completely based on open architecture. We even have a product we call open radio architecture that we demonstrated in a U-2, Lockheed U-2, of course, as basically a cell tower in the sky connecting F-35 and F-22 data links to again, the open radio architecture. And we could add an F-18, or another aircraft, even an allied aircraft, a Eurofighter, for example, down the road. The whole point of this is you want to build the network effect as broadly as you can across, frankly, all the platforms out there eventually. But we're building a roadmap internally in the Lockheed Martin because this -- these are the products and platforms we can control to install, trial, demonstrate and then produce these in our products. At the same time, like I said earlier, we're open to collaborating with our industry partners that are traditional in Defense and Aerospace, and eagerly and already successfully with some of my old counterparts and my former counterparts, I should say, in telecom and tech where we're trying to build out the Internet of Things network of the future here. So this is something where you can and must have an open architecture at the vendor lock, so to speak, will diminish. But this is a matter of leadership and speed and performance. And that's where Lockheed Martin can, I think, take a great position going forward here.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Jim and Ken.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Maybe I was wondering if you could just update us on the classified business in general, how big is it across the businesses? How do you quantify risk versus rest of the segment -- rest of the business? And maybe, where are you seeing the most opportunities?\nJames Taiclet: Sure. Hey, Sheila, good morning. I'll take that. So, yes, generally speaking, our customers frown upon us from talking about the size of classified, but if you think about it, Aeronautics and Space would have the largest classified business in our portfolio. Third would be missiles and fire control, and then fourth, but last but not least, I'll stress is RMS. We see a lot of opportunities in Space. And that has not been something that's recent, but it seems to be trending up in an accelerated way. And also in Aeronautics, we've talked about this unfortunate missed charge on this program that we have today. As I stress when asked earlier, we do believe this thing has a very strong business case going forward, which will continue to grow. There's also other programs in the Aeronautics portfolio that will continue to grow. Missiles and Fire Control, we've talked about the classified program we won that requires some capital that is still in development and in the not too distant future that also will go into production. So we see the classified portion of Lockheed Martin growing faster than the non-classified portion of Lockheed Martin. Regarding how we run classified versus non-classified, that's a timely question because the -- recall when I answered the question about our classified business and Security Committee of our Board, that is one thing that we do go demonstrate to them that the processes that we have in the white world are identical to the processes that we try to put in the black world, and we also have the -- internal audit. Organization is part of that and we just reaffirm that and our external auditors, E&Y, are also instrumental and part of that. So the key is we try to mirror what we're doing in the non-classified from a process standpoint into the classified world.\nOperator: Next we'll go to Seth Seifman with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, thanks. Thanks very much and good morning, everyone.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning, Seth.\nSeth Seifman: Ken, I was -- good morning. Ken, I was wondering, we've talked a little in the past about the F-35 production revenue outlook and you mentioned the rebaselining earlier. If we think about F-35 production sales this year probably being in the, let's say, the mid $13 billion range. As you think about this rebaselining, where does that head into 2022? And then, how would it eventually get up to that plateau, which I assume is something in the range of 170 times the price per aircraft of -- for the three variants. I don't know, maybe it's $90 million on average or something like that. But specifically for next year, how does the rebaselining affect your production revenue expectations?\nKen Possenriede: Yes. Thanks, Seth, and good morning to you. Yes, so we're still -- as I said earlier, we're still working through that rebaseline with the Joint Program Office who think of that as the quarterback, the program manager dealing with the services and the international customers. So all I could say today is our base plan was 169 aircraft. It is highly likely we are going to deliver less aircraft next year than 169. I just don't know what that is. And the only other thing I could say, and I don't mean to make this sound like Yogi Berra, but it's likely going to be less than what it would have been. I'm not suggesting it'll be less than this year, but it'll be less than -- the forecasted 169 and you're spot on, Seth. This rebase line may take 2, 3 years. And again, that's something else we'll get from the customer and the plateau will ultimately be 170 aircraft, perhaps a little bit more. And that plateau then will extend out farther out into the future than what we thought. And back to Jim's opening comments, we were just notified we won in Switzerland. That is a big, big deal for us. We just put in our best and final offer in for Finland. We're in the hunt for the next generation fighter aircraft in Canada. There are many other customers that have an interest in this aircraft including this -- of course, the services of the United States. So we think there is a strong demand out there for this aircraft. Regarding price -- regarding the B variant and the C variant, just based on quantities, it's likely you'll see the price of that aircraft either stay where it is or continue to come down the learning curve. The A variant, and I'm not trying to negotiate with the customer on the phone, but due to where we are in learning, due to where we are with inflation and due to where we are with the added capabilities that they want on the aircraft, it is likely you'll see an increase in prices, a modest increase in prices of where we are today. You got to factor all that in. We should have a better answer for you in the October time period in terms of what the impact is.\nOperator: And next we'll go to Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good morning. Ken, can you just talk about kind of how much of the portfolio maybe arrows specifically is related to sustainment? And are you seeing any pressure there? Is there been any shift in focus from -- less of a focus on readiness, more on modernization under this administration? And then just on your comment on the F-35 Block 5 margins, is that just related to the technology insertion? Or are there kind of other challenges you're facing just on pausing risk retirements on F-35? Thank you.\nKen Possenriede: You bet, Joe. Good morning. So on sustainment, think of sustainment, there is sustainment in F-35, which back to the comments Jim made and then I made earlier, we still see strong demand. Well, of course, we want to get the cost per flight hour down. We also want to ensure that there's available aircraft out there, but the demand is going to grow there. And there is a keen desire for the more fielded aircraft that we have out there, the more robust sustainment program we have. We also have sustainment -- think of sustainment on F-22. I mean, eventually F-22s are going to get sunset, but I would say in the foreseeable future think of F-22 sales not being quite, say, a $1 billion -- they're over a $1 billion. And going forward, you may see that decline just a little bit. F-16, a big portion of F-16 is sustainment for international customers. And I believe we've mentioned this in the not too distant past. We actually got a contract with the United States Air Force to sustain their aircraft. And it's been quite a while since we've gotten a current contract for that. So I don't see that demand going away or the interest going away either. C-130, a big piece of that is sustainment of aircraft internationally. And then, in our Skunk Works, think of the U-2 is a sustainment contract, and ultimately they'll get sunsetted as well, but not in the -- not too distant future. And your second question was on Block 5 margins. Yes, it's right now, Joe, we're seeing -- we're taking a pause because what we agree to in negotiations from a learning curve standpoint coming down a learning curve, we're still coming down the learning curve from a -- this is costs now, down the learning curve not as robust as we planned to take these risks retirements. So we want to see continued performance into next year before we take those risks retirements at that time. And so think of Block 5 margins are very high, single-digit margins. These risk retirements would take them up into the low double-digit margins, but we'll likely keep pausing that until next year.\nGreg Gardner: Hey, John, this is Greg. I think we've come up at the top of the hour. So I will turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\nJames Taiclet: All right, Greg. Thanks. Look, I will just stand by reinforcing our commitments. First, our 21st Century Warfare vision, which will make our platforms and services more resilient and more attractive to the customer, in addition to making us more effective in creating a deterrent. Also investments and digital transformation and innovation, and delivering thereby strong cash generation supporting that afterwards that a strong dividend as we deliver long-term value to you all. And I want to just thank you again for joining us today. We're going to have an upcoming investor event in August. We hope you can join us for that. And John you can conclude the call then. Thank you everybody for being here this morning.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our second quarter 2021 earnings call. I will begin my remarks this morning with a few comments on our financial results, which Ken will elaborate on in a few minutes. Our second quarter sales increased 5% over last year's second quarter as each business area exceeded 2020 levels led by our Space team. Our Space business grew over 10% this quarter due to growth in hypersonics, Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared or OPIR satellite activities, and increased support provided to the U.K Ministry of Defense's Atomic Weapons Establishment program, which will close out our management of that activity. Our segment operating profit was impacted this quarter by a one-time charge associated with a classified program in our Aeronautics business area. While the classified nature of this program precludes us from discussing this matter in depth, we can say that our customer is highly attracted to the capabilities that we're developing on their behalf that we're committed to delivering these capabilities and that the long-term potential of this solution is significant for the company. Our cash generation remains strong, driving $1.3 billion of cash from operations this quarter after making $1.4 billion of accelerated payments to our supply base as we continue to mitigate the risks brought on by COVID-19 for our supply chain. Our cash generation and the strength of our balance sheet gave us the ability to complete a $500 million accelerated share repurchase agreement this quarter, in addition to the $1 billion ASR executed last quarter, thereby bringing our year-to-date repurchases to $1.5 billion. We remain confident in our ability to continue driving strong cash generation and supporting balanced cash deployment actions, including investing in key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities and returning cash to shareholders. Turning to budgets, the White House submitted their fiscal year 2022 budget proposal to Congress requesting $715 billion for the Department of Defense, an $11 billion increase from the FY '21 enacted budget. Our programs continue to be well supported, including over $12 billion for the F-35 program, approximately $3.5 billion for our signature Sikorsky helicopters, and over $2 billion for hypersonics programs. The President's budget request prioritizes funding for innovation and modernization as well, in recognition of the need to invest in technologies and capabilities to address the great power competition the nation now faces. These include areas of strength within the Lockheed Martin portfolio such as continued support for Air and Missile Defense programs, THAAD, PAC-3, and our recent next-generation interceptor award; space domain initiatives including OPIR, and GPS III satellites, and the space development agency's Transport Layer Architecture. The Defense Department request also focused on investments in advanced capability enablers. We believe this vision of deterrence and innovation is well aligned with our broad portfolio in our 21st Century Warfare vision. In Congressional March to-date of the FY '22 defense budget request, we continue to see strong support from the hill for all of our programs, which include increases for F-35, C-130, CH-53K, and UH-60 programs and fully approved budget requests for many of our other systems. Turning to some strategic and operational achievements in this quarter, I'd like to begin by highlighting the company's participation in Northern Edge 21, a U.S. Indo-Pacific Command exercise in support of the Pacific deterrence initiative. This live exercise included multiple U.S military services across a very wide geographic area, with a goal of enhancing joint interoperability between the services and the various domains that they operate in. Signature programs from all four of our business areas participated in this event, and we successfully demonstrated joint all-domain command and control known as JADC2. We demonstrated capabilities such as enhanced situational awareness by integrating sensors across land, sea, air, and space, for example. Among our successful demonstrations during -- of JADC2 during the exercise was one, enabling Aegis and PAC-3 MSE integration for an integrated air and missile defense against advanced threats; also using the F-35 to provide real-time tracking and targeting data generated near San Diego during a flight to the All Domain Operations Center in Alaska for prosecution and fire control; also facilitating space-based connectivity at the same time, using the MUOS narrowband satellite communications constellation; and also supporting the Air National Guard's demonstration of a new data link capability with our Legion Pod, which integrates our infrared search and track targeting sensor technology into that broader network. The Northern Edge exercise demonstrated our integrated offensive and defensive fires capability, our satellite communication links, as well as the ability to adapt joint battle management concepts in real time. One of my goals in the first year as CEO of Lockheed Martin was to actually demonstrate the benefits of network effects to our customers using existing platforms under our 21st century warfare concept. Our integrated performance in Northern Edge did exactly that, and we're just getting started. Moving to some specific business area highlights. In Aeronautics, Switzerland's Federal Council announced its decision to purchase 36 F-35A conventional takeoff and landing or CTOL aircraft, along with sustainment and training services as part of their Air2030 modernization program. This is a significant win for Lockheed Martin with an initial value of $5.5 billion and a total value of approximately $15 billion over 30 years. The F-35 was selected over the F-18, the Rafale, and the Eurofighter because of its survivability, information superiority, and comprehensively network systems. The Swiss Council also noted that the F-35 delivered outstanding value offering both the lowest procurement and operational costs across all those competing aircrafts. Switzerland will become the 15th nation to join the program since its inception, and we're excited to welcome them into the F-35 community. In Rotary and Mission systems, the U.S Navy awarded our Sikorsky team a contract for nine CH-53K heavy lift helicopters for production Lot 5, which is worth nearly $900 million, and we're continuing to drive cost down and provide reduced unit prices to our customer. The award also included the option for nine additional King Stallion aircraft for Lot 6, which when those are exercised would represent over $1.9 billion in order for the Lot 5 and 6 combined. Including the previous Lot 5 award we received, orders for 33 53K's out of a Navy program record of 200. So, a long way to go over 80% of domestic aircraft quantities are still in front of us, and interest from international customers is driving additional opportunities. Also in RMS, our C6ISR team participated in a unique collaboration with the Air Force to integrate critical battle management capabilities from our command and control legacy product, The Theater Battle Management Control System or TBMCS into the Air Force's new Kessel Run All Domain Operations Suite. The TBMSC -- TBMCS was first declared a system of record in 2000 and performs the planning and execution of air missions, interfacing with many other operations, intelligence, and C2 systems throughout the U.S armed services. Our RMS team delivered a cloud-based architecture and delivery plan to enhance capabilities and migrate TBMCS data into the Kessel Run operation suite in support of pilots and commanders executing joint air campaigns. So another example of our 21st century work fair concept and action with our Air Force customer in this case. In Missiles and Fire Control, our integrated Air and Missile Defense line of business delivered the first PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement or MSE interceptors to Sweden, providing a country with the world's most advanced air defense capabilities to defend against incoming threats. Sweden now becomes one of 10 international customers to choose PAC-3 MSE missiles. In addition, our Space business area successfully launched two new satellites in support of critical national security space objectives. Our fifth Space Based Infrared System and Geosynchronous Earth Orbit or SBIRS GEO-5 satellite successfully deployed from its United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket and is now communicating with the operations team from the U.S space force. SBIRS GEO-5 is the latest satellite to join the space forces orbiting early warning missile constellation and its equipped with powerful surveillance sensors to support ballistic missile defense, and expand technical intelligence gathering and bolster situational awareness for the guardians that are defending the U.S and its allies. The SBIRS GEO-5 satellite is the first military satellite built on an LM 2100 Combat Bus. That's a more resilient, modernized and modular space vehicle originally developed using Lockheed Martin internal investment. Also the fifth Global Positioning System or GPS III satellite was also successfully launched this quarter. The GPS III Space Vehicle 5 is the 31st operational GPS satellite in the constellation with significant advancements over previous GPS Space Vehicles, including three times better accuracy and improved anti-jamming capabilities. The GPS III and OPIR satellite constellations are both Lockheed Martin's signature programs and represent key elements of our network centric 21st century warfare concept. And lastly, our space business area was selected by NASA to build spacecraft for two separate missions to Venus. Lockheed Martin will design, build and operate the VERITAS orbiter to investigate the surface and subsurface of Venus, and the DAVINCI+ vehicle to research the planet's atmosphere. These missions build on our legacy Magellan program for the exploration of Venus and will represent NASA's first return to the planet in more than three decades. These achievements from across the company highlight our focus on providing innovative solutions, and the strength that our broad portfolio gives us to support our customers missions and their all domain objectives. I'll close my remarks today with a quick status on the strategic acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne that we announced last December, a transaction that we believe will enhance Lockheed Martin's as well as all of industry's ability to meet our future national security and civil space objectives when it comes to propulsion. We are committed to achieving the key DoD priorities of reducing cost, increasing the quality and speed of new products, in addition to enhancing Aerojet Rocketdyne's position as a leading merchant supplier to all of industry. We remain in the process of responding to the Federal Trade Commission's second request for information, which we received earlier in the year, a step in the review process that we'd expected. We continue to engage with the FTC and Department of Defense stakeholders regularly as part of their review, and pending approval, we hope to -- and expect to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. With that, I'll turn it over to Ken. Good morning. Good morning, Doug. With the resurgence of great power competition with China and Russia, the defense enterprise overall is at an inflection point. And when I say defense enterprise, I mean government, military, and industry. It needs to change. And where I think I can address your question is during that period of change, and it's very important and critical that we started now that Lockheed Martin is in a position with its breadth of platforms and systems and its cutting edge technology to both drive and benefit from that needed change. And so, yes, over the next 5 years, we're going to strive for mid-single-digit growth, and I'm energized and enthusiastic about working with our government military leaders, which we've already started. And with our defense sector and telecom and technology sectors, partners that we're going to have in the future to do this. And I'm convinced that our shareholders are going to benefit from our leadership here. We're going to benefit in a couple ways, and one of them is going to be by enhancing the value of our legacy programs, including the obvious F-35 is a much valuable, more valuable platform when you take advantage of the network effect that it can deliver by connecting sensors across domains, adding 5G.mil capability to our comm system so that we can communicate with satellites directly, etcetera, you end up getting a whole network effect with a value to the defense enterprise and the deterrent value is going to go up by implementing this across our technology roadmap over the next number of years, our existing systems. So, I'm very energized about the growth prospect. I think we have a uniquely positioned capability to drive it and that we've got a unique capability to interact with commercial industry in a whole number of sectors to help it happen. The inflection point of need is here, Doug, but the system we will work within does not move abruptly, let's say. So it's got to migrate over a period of time in its way, if you will, and Congress will have a part in that. It's going to be a little bit more deliberate as far as the budget turns out. But within that budget, we intend to make our products, platforms, and services the leading edge and therefore the most attractive ways to allocate that budget in all the domains that we serve. So, we're actually not expecting our 21st century warfare concept to get funded independently. Rather, we're going to use that to make our current and future platforms way more competitive, way more attractive, use a network effect to get more value for money for the government and see how the budget can shift our way, depending on -- and in fact, irrespective of how much the top line grows. Let me ask Ken to follow-up on that. Good morning, Noah. Good morning. Good morning. Sure. We've spent about $500 million to date in investments to improve the sustainability cause of the F-35 there, Peter. And we'll continue to make reasonable investments as we go forward. But there's a perspective that I can give you from a former Air Force pilot, because operationally and on the line, where the pilots and the commanders are flying the jets and defending the country and doing the missions, there's actually a lot of good things happening, and they'll tell you this themselves. But first of all, you can go to the performance metrics, meaning that flight hour between failure metric, when can you expect to fly the jet before you've got to get a spare airplane that day. It's nearly double the contractual requirement. And so the pilots when they get an assignment from the tail number for a mission, on any given day, they're twice as likely to get in that airplane and fly the mission as they are in any other fourth gen plane. On top of that, it's about twice as reliable as a fourth generation fighter. And meanwhile, the labor hours of maintenance needed for each of those flight hours is about two-thirds of the contractual requirements. So if you get out to bases, and talk to commanders who have either in their wings, F-35s and other aircraft, or they've commanded different squadrons of different types of aircraft, they'll tell you that for the frontline performance in the area of operations, if you will, the F-35 is sort of head and shoulders above legacy aircraft. In fact, the Air Force had about 18 months in CENTCOM recently, where they just got back from that tour, if you will. They had 1,300 sorties with F-35s, and the mission capable rate was all -- it was nearly 75%, sometimes 80% to 90%, any given week. And that's really, really strong, haven't been out and done this before, I can tell you that that's top shelf. Now, on the other hand, the affordability we need to address and I've met with each of the service chiefs and the chairman to implore all of us to work together on this. Lockheed Martin with that $500 million investment over the last few years has taken about 40% of the cost that we can control out of our purview, if you will. Already, we're going to shoot for another 40% over the next 5 years, but somehow 40% keeps coming up. We're only about 40% of the total cost. So 60% is propulsion and military government cost. If we don't have an all-in strategy together to address this we are not going to hit the goals. And so, again, when I meet with the chiefs and the chairman, and hopefully soon with the service chiefs, we will all get together on a tiger team and address this in the only way it can be successfully addressed as an integrated team. So that's how we're going to approach it. I do agree with the team at Aeronautics that there is a way to get this cost per flying hour on an A model of 25,000 an hour, but it's got to be an all-in approach. And we're going to keep doing our part, of course. But we're -- I'm personally involved in trying to pull the wider team together to get that done. Good morning. Sure. I'll take both. Yes, unfortunately, David, NGAD, everything about NGAD is classified. The only thing I will say is you've heard the customers, the DoD say that F-35 is not going to be a build pair of NGAD. And I still think that's still the answer out there which is good news for the -- our great fifth gen aircraft. But unfortunately everything else regarding NGAD is classified and we can't discuss what our role or not our role is. Regarding the amortization of R&D, we're still working with a lot of our constituents. When we come out with trend data in October, David, our tax experts are telling us unfortunately at that time, it's likely not to be settled. So it is likely we will offer trend data for '22. That would -- right now what we see is assuming this issue goes away or gets deferred and does not impact '22 cash, we see $9 billion or greater of cash from operations next year. So we're in the midst of going through our long range plan. So hopefully we'll be able to reaffirm that. But we're also -- then also going to have to state that right now what we see is this amortization issue was a $2.1 billion impact to cash in '22. We're hopeful that this thing either gets deferred out 5 years, that's one scenario we're hearing. I mean, what we'll see where it goes, or it gets repealed, or it is interpreted differently than the way we industry are interpreting. And it really is just what I'll call conventional independent research and development for us, which would be rough numbers, a $300 million impact rather than a $2.1 billion impact. But regardless, Lockheed Martin sees a path forward for us to continue generating strong cash this year and into the next couple years. And we'll use that for our internal and organic inorganic investments for our employees, and then give a fair amount back to our shareholders. Hey. Sure. Rob, the two things are completely compatible and my recent experience has been that telecom and tech industry where it was essential that open architecture be the baseline, or the foundation, if you will, for 4G and 5G network development in telecom, for example. So our approach is completely based on open architecture. We even have a product we call open radio architecture that we demonstrated in a U-2, Lockheed U-2, of course, as basically a cell tower in the sky connecting F-35 and F-22 data links to again, the open radio architecture. And we could add an F-18, or another aircraft, even an allied aircraft, a Eurofighter, for example, down the road. The whole point of this is you want to build the network effect as broadly as you can across, frankly, all the platforms out there eventually. But we're building a roadmap internally in the Lockheed Martin because this -- these are the products and platforms we can control to install, trial, demonstrate and then produce these in our products. At the same time, like I said earlier, we're open to collaborating with our industry partners that are traditional in Defense and Aerospace, and eagerly and already successfully with some of my old counterparts and my former counterparts, I should say, in telecom and tech where we're trying to build out the Internet of Things network of the future here. So this is something where you can and must have an open architecture at the vendor lock, so to speak, will diminish. But this is a matter of leadership and speed and performance. And that's where Lockheed Martin can, I think, take a great position going forward here. Good morning. Sure. Hey, Sheila, good morning. I'll take that. So, yes, generally speaking, our customers frown upon us from talking about the size of classified, but if you think about it, Aeronautics and Space would have the largest classified business in our portfolio. Third would be missiles and fire control, and then fourth, but last but not least, I'll stress is RMS. We see a lot of opportunities in Space. And that has not been something that's recent, but it seems to be trending up in an accelerated way. And also in Aeronautics, we've talked about this unfortunate missed charge on this program that we have today. As I stress when asked earlier, we do believe this thing has a very strong business case going forward, which will continue to grow. There's also other programs in the Aeronautics portfolio that will continue to grow. Missiles and Fire Control, we've talked about the classified program we won that requires some capital that is still in development and in the not too distant future that also will go into production. So we see the classified portion of Lockheed Martin growing faster than the non-classified portion of Lockheed Martin. Regarding how we run classified versus non-classified, that's a timely question because the -- recall when I answered the question about our classified business and Security Committee of our Board, that is one thing that we do go demonstrate to them that the processes that we have in the white world are identical to the processes that we try to put in the black world, and we also have the -- internal audit. Organization is part of that and we just reaffirm that and our external auditors, E&Y, are also instrumental and part of that. So the key is we try to mirror what we're doing in the non-classified from a process standpoint into the classified world. Good morning, Seth. All right, Greg. Thanks. Look, I will just stand by reinforcing our commitments. First, our 21st Century Warfare vision, which will make our platforms and services more resilient and more attractive to the customer, in addition to making us more effective in creating a deterrent. Also investments and digital transformation and innovation, and delivering thereby strong cash generation supporting that afterwards that a strong dividend as we deliver long-term value to you all. And I want to just thank you again for joining us today. We're going to have an upcoming investor event in August. We hope you can join us for that. And John you can conclude the call then. Thank you everybody for being here this morning."

            "name": "Ken Possenriede",
            "content": "Hey, thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts that we have included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3, and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw solid growth in sales and earnings per share. Segment operating profit was comparable to last year's second quarter total due to the $225 million impact of a classified aeronautics program, while cash from operations was $1.3 billion exceeding our expectations for the quarter. For the second consecutive quarter, cash return to shareholders exceeded 100% of free cash flow as we executed another $500 million of share repurchases in addition to $721 million of dividends paid. Despite the issue of a single contract, we were able to increase our outlook for earnings per share and hold our full year outlook for all other key financial metrics. Turning to Chart 4, we compare ourselves and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Second quarter sales grew 5% compared with 2020 to $17 billion, continuing our expected growth of the business, while segment operating profit remains at approximately $1.8 billion comparable to last year's results. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for the second quarter of 2021. Our earnings per share of $6.52 was $0.73 above our results last year driven by volume, reduced share count and higher FAS/CAS income. On Chart 6, we will look at our cash generation and distributions for the second quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.3 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was $950 million. By executing additional share repurchases of $500 million in the second quarter as well as providing our dividend of $2.60 per share, we were able to generate -- excuse me, we're able to return 129% of free cash flow to our stockholders this quarter. Moving on to Chart 7. As we noted, we are increasing our outlook for earnings per share and holding our outlook for sales segment operating profit and cash from operations. Looking at Chart 8, we are increasing the sales outlook for RMS by $150 million. And that's primarily driven by volume at Sikorsky as well as a $25 million increase at our space business area and combined offset the downward adjustment in aeronautics, keeping total sales consistent with our prior guidance. In our Chart 9, we show the increased segment operating profit range for RMS, Missiles and Fire Control and Space, also offsetting the impact realized at Aeronautics, which allowed us to hold our guidance for the year, and we will continue to pursue cost takeout and margin improvement opportunities across the corporation On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our update to the guidance for 2021 earnings per share. Program performance and continued cost takeout offset our impact at Aeronautics, and we also saw improvements to earnings per share from investments and other non-operational items, along with the benefit of our continued share repurchases. To conclude on Chart 11, we have our summary. We continue to see sales growth year-over-year as well as strong operational cash performance, while still accelerating cash to our supply chain to meet commitments vital to our national security. And, as noted, we have increased our full outlook for earnings per share and are holding all other key metrics as we look ahead to the second half of 2021. And with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A. Hey, Doug, if I could, I will give -- I will just give you a little more color that'll hopefully complement what Jim said. So, if you think about our portfolio and where we are and where we're going, so F-35, rough numbers 27%, 28% of our portfolio and you think about where we are and where we're going with that program. So we're right now for production in the midst of our product -- what's called a production rebaseline. And that's basically due to COVID and trying to get our technology Refresh 3 on Lot 15 and Block 4 onto Lot 16. The customer -- the joint program office is working with all the key constituents to look at what makes sense. As you recall, this year we're going to deliver anywhere from 133 to 139 aircraft. What makes sense next year and into the next couple years to make sure we maximize when we put that key technology on that aircraft. So, you're going to likely see once that gets revealed, and hopefully it'll be -- we'll be able to reveal that with the customer when we give trend data in October, but it's likely to show the plateau of production slightly pushed out to the right but also elongating, if you will. So I think at least in the next couple of years, there is likely some opportunity there from a production standpoint. There is definitely opportunity for us in sustainment if you think about it, only roughly 40%, 50% of the bases are stood up. So, we still have a lot of work to do there. We're also going to have many more aircraft in the fleet in the next couple of years. Think of in the next couple of years, we're going to have over 1,000 aircraft in the fleet which are going to require more sparing, that modernization I just talked about working with the customer, we're also going to have to modernize some aircraft to put this new technology on aircraft that are already in the fleet. So that's one area. Sticking with that -- excuse me, sticking with Aeronautics, you have F-16 which is an international play that we have a backlog of 128 aircraft that is going to continue to grow top line as will Skunk Works. That's going to become a larger part of the Aeronautics platform. And just sticking internationally, we see strong demand for our integrated Air Missile Defense products. If you look at our helicopter programs, we're just starting to deliver CH-53 aircraft program, a record of 200 plus to the Israelis, hopefully, it'll be a couple other countries that have an interest in that platform. And then there's future vertical lift, which will give us a huge uplift in the middle of this decade going forward when we win those programs. And then there's Space. You mentioned hypersonics, that is going to be a nice complimentary part of that portfolio. I agree, it's not going to dramatically move the needle, but you're going to have those programs go into production in the middle of this decade, which will give us some uplift and then National Security Space, whether it's classified OPIR, NGI, we'll see some strong growth there. So we feel pretty good. Complementing what Jim said, we feel pretty good about our prospects going forward. Hey, Cai. Good morning. Good to talk to you. This is Ken. I will take that. So if you think about when we did the ASR, we basically put that in place the day after, we were allowed to trade again, which would have been a day after earnings. And as I mentioned before, if you look at the large amount of cash that we have, our thought back then and it still remains today, we continue to have that cash on our balance sheet. And we believe we're going to continue to have that after Aerojet Rocketdyne, we're going to remain in the market. That was our thought process in April, when we did the $500 million ASR. We're highly likely based on where our stock price is trading today. We're going to enter the market again as soon as we're able to -- may not be an ASR, but we're going to go into the open market and buy back more stock, it just absolutely makes sense to do that. Regarding when we knew about the charge, that basically happened in the May time period. It became clear, based off from a process standpoint, Cai, we had a joint customer, Lockheed Martin review to do a deep dive on the program. And then we also did one, that was Lockheed Martin only to provide an additional assurance function. So we've done a very thorough assessment of the situation and that was done in the May time period. And in fact, in the June time period, we reported out to our Board, so Jim, myself, and Frank St. John, our COO, reported out to the Board and we also had what's called a classified business and security committee meeting, and we actually owe them a comeback in September. So that all initiated in May, we're very comfortable with the charge. Just to give a little bit of a flavor of that $225 million, that is for the development portion of this program. Think of that as roughly 40% of that cost has already occurred and the other 60% is embedded in the new estimate to complete. So we're not assuming that this program goes forward with the current the -- excuse me, the prior ETC. It is a new estimate to complete with that over on embedded. So we think we have a good handle on that. And from a timing standpoint, it was after the ASR was put in place. You bet. So, yes, let's first talk about the classified program. And I'll assure you know, and for everybody on the call, what we are able to say we've got approval from the customer. And hopefully, I've given you guys enough experience where I'll be as transparent as I can. But on this there's only so much we could say. So, as I answered to Cai's question, no, we've done a lot of independent reviews. We've done reviews with the customer. We think today based on all the information we have, it's a development contract that we believe will be successful from a schedule and performance standpoint, and then ultimately will turn into production -- a production program. And we also believe there are additional opportunities out there. And I'll assure you, we believe, I could say this, that there is still a very strong business case, given these associated opportunity. So this will be a great program for our customers. And I'm talking about all the customers out there that are going to utilize this and it'll be a good program for the Lockheed Martin Corporation. Regarding Aeronautics, Noah, you've got it right. For the second half of the year, we're basically assuming a little bit over 11% return on sales. And think of that as it's got to be primarily F-35. It will be -- from that standpoint, we are assuming some risk retirement on some production programs. I have mentioned in the past on the Block 5 we have taken a pause on risk retirements until we see improved performance there probably next year. But there are other lots out there. Back to the comments we made about our cost takeout initiatives, cost competitive niches, and our strong performance in other parts of the portfolio. We believe F-35 production, there's other opportunities out there for us to have risk retirements. F-16, we'll also see some improvement as we'll see 130. So I think you got that right. Aeronautics, we feel comfortable being around 11% or a little bit above 11% return on sales for the second half of the year. Hi. So -- hey, Kristine, it's Ken. I'll take that one. So, yes, we are in the thick of that with the contracts that you described. And we're very pleased with the performance we've had on these programs. And we're also pleased where we think the customers going. I think we'll see a dramatic increase with our involvement, but you have to put that in perspective relative to the size of what it is. But it will be accretive from a top line standpoint. It's just for a $68 billion company that will continue to grow, at least in the next 5 years. Kristine, it's not going to be a -- I'd say, a material impact. In terms of miniaturization, we're working that with the customer. I think based on what we've seen, we're some ways away from that though. But we will give you an update when there is one to give. You're right. So Myles, we've done for the first half of the year a little over $3 billion, which would tell you we've -- we need to do $6.9 billion. And based on what I'm seeing the lion share of that -- I'm not giving you much comfort, but once I finish, I will hopefully the lion share of that $6.9 billion is in the fourth quarter. And really the driver there is we're in the midst and a lot of this is due to COVID. We're in the midst of renegotiating, if you will, the timing and the amounts of performance based payments on the F-35 program that's specifically Block 5. We're working through that now. And if you look at January 1 to the end of the second quarter, rough numbers, our contract assets grew by roughly $1.9 billion. The lion share of that is F-35 and the lion share of that is performance-based payments; timing, if you will, of when we liquidate that for F-35. We believe we're on a path with the customer to close on that. This is the third quarter to close it -- close on that in the third quarter. And just to give you a little more color, we think -- excuse me, we think contract assets are going to grow another $500 million in the third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter and most of that will be before December to give you some comfort, we will be liquidating contract assets to the point where we only see contract assets growing in total by an immaterial amount, they will still come down quite a bit and that's driven by the fourth quarter. And most of that is driven by Aeronautics. There is some work that needs to be done from a cash collection standpoint at RMS as well. But the lion share of that is Aeronautics. And we feel really bullish miles about the $8.9 billion of cash from ops for this year. In terms of backlog, I think we've already stated that. So you've got Lot 15, that we thought for F-35 that we thought would settle last year. We believe it's now going to settle this year. There's just a lot of complications going on and we think the joint program office working with all the constituents, it has a very difficult job, but they're doing a really great job of coordinating what the demands and the needs are of the services plus the international customers. We think that'll close in the third quarter. But because of that we have little to no comfort that Lot 16 is going to close this year. So we're actually out looking that to close next year. And that that's a sizable order. It's just timing, which means right now we're forecasting backlog to end this year at about $143 billion. So we're actually going to erode backlog this year. But again, I'll stress that's all timing. And for Lockheed Martin, we've gotten enough advanced funding on those Lots for 15 and 16, where it is not an impact to us. It'll just be optically a reduction in backlog. So, Peter, just based on timing, based on what Jim just said, we are starting to see a lot of interest. If you recall, we issued a white paper that described how we would drive down the costs, we described how industry would sign up to service level agreements. And as Jim mentioned, we are making great progress with the energy industry consortium. And we do think we have Pratt Whitney from a propulsion standpoint and the services fully engaged now. And we believe we're going to soon be responding to an RFP. They're going to take a lot of the key pieces out of our white paper for us then to what I'll call answer a conventional request for proposal. And we're hopeful that early next year, we industry could be under contract for some type of performance based logistics concept. And I'll just remind you that this is likely not going to be a top line enhancement play for us. That that's probably all embedded. But assuming the industry is incentivized to hit these targets or to over achieve these targets, it could potentially be a return on sales play for us. Yes. Thanks, Seth, and good morning to you. Yes, so we're still -- as I said earlier, we're still working through that rebaseline with the Joint Program Office who think of that as the quarterback, the program manager dealing with the services and the international customers. So all I could say today is our base plan was 169 aircraft. It is highly likely we are going to deliver less aircraft next year than 169. I just don't know what that is. And the only other thing I could say, and I don't mean to make this sound like Yogi Berra, but it's likely going to be less than what it would have been. I'm not suggesting it'll be less than this year, but it'll be less than -- the forecasted 169 and you're spot on, Seth. This rebase line may take 2, 3 years. And again, that's something else we'll get from the customer and the plateau will ultimately be 170 aircraft, perhaps a little bit more. And that plateau then will extend out farther out into the future than what we thought. And back to Jim's opening comments, we were just notified we won in Switzerland. That is a big, big deal for us. We just put in our best and final offer in for Finland. We're in the hunt for the next generation fighter aircraft in Canada. There are many other customers that have an interest in this aircraft including this -- of course, the services of the United States. So we think there is a strong demand out there for this aircraft. Regarding price -- regarding the B variant and the C variant, just based on quantities, it's likely you'll see the price of that aircraft either stay where it is or continue to come down the learning curve. The A variant, and I'm not trying to negotiate with the customer on the phone, but due to where we are in learning, due to where we are with inflation and due to where we are with the added capabilities that they want on the aircraft, it is likely you'll see an increase in prices, a modest increase in prices of where we are today. You got to factor all that in. We should have a better answer for you in the October time period in terms of what the impact is. You bet, Joe. Good morning. So on sustainment, think of sustainment, there is sustainment in F-35, which back to the comments Jim made and then I made earlier, we still see strong demand. Well, of course, we want to get the cost per flight hour down. We also want to ensure that there's available aircraft out there, but the demand is going to grow there. And there is a keen desire for the more fielded aircraft that we have out there, the more robust sustainment program we have. We also have sustainment -- think of sustainment on F-22. I mean, eventually F-22s are going to get sunset, but I would say in the foreseeable future think of F-22 sales not being quite, say, a $1 billion -- they're over a $1 billion. And going forward, you may see that decline just a little bit. F-16, a big portion of F-16 is sustainment for international customers. And I believe we've mentioned this in the not too distant past. We actually got a contract with the United States Air Force to sustain their aircraft. And it's been quite a while since we've gotten a current contract for that. So I don't see that demand going away or the interest going away either. C-130, a big piece of that is sustainment of aircraft internationally. And then, in our Skunk Works, think of the U-2 is a sustainment contract, and ultimately they'll get sunsetted as well, but not in the -- not too distant future. And your second question was on Block 5 margins. Yes, it's right now, Joe, we're seeing -- we're taking a pause because what we agree to in negotiations from a learning curve standpoint coming down a learning curve, we're still coming down the learning curve from a -- this is costs now, down the learning curve not as robust as we planned to take these risks retirements. So we want to see continued performance into next year before we take those risks retirements at that time. And so think of Block 5 margins are very high, single-digit margins. These risk retirements would take them up into the low double-digit margins, but we'll likely keep pausing that until next year."

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Greg Gardner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nGreg Gardner: Thank you, John, and good morning. I'd like to welcome everyone to our first quarter 2021 earnings conference call. Joining me today on the call are Jim Taiclet, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ken Possenriede, our Chief Financial Officer. Statements made in today's call that are not historical facts are considered forward-looking statements and are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of federal securities law. Actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Please see today's press release and our SEC filings for a description of some of the factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. We have posted charts on our website today that we plan to address during the call to supplement our comments. These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com, and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJames Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. As today's release illustrates, we had a strong financial results this quarter, and continue to perform at a high level strategically and operationally. Our achievements reflect the quality of our workforce, the breadth of our products and services and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and stockholders. We continue to deliver these results in spite of the ongoing difficulties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. And my thanks go to the men and women of Lockheed Martin for their outstanding contributions during these challenging times. I'll begin today with a quick update on the strategic acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne that we announced in December, a transaction we believe will enhance Lockheed Martin's ability to develop and supply advanced products in support of national security and our civil space objectives. We also plan to strengthen Aerojet Rocketdyne's capabilities as a merchant supplier with improved offerings for all of its industry and government customer, which is a critical component of closing our acquisition business case. Last month, Aerojet stockholders approved the merger agreement with over 99% of votes cast being in favor of the transaction. Also, this quarter, as expected, both companies received a request for additional information or a second request from the Federal Trade Commission as part of the regulatory review process. The second request extends the waiting period pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. We're working cooperatively with the FTC and continue to expect resolution of the regulatory review process by the latter part of 2021. Moving to our financial and operational results. Lockheed Martin got off to a strong start for the year. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide an update to our 2021 financial outlook, which increases key financial metrics across the board. But I'd like to continue by providing a few highlights right up front. First quarter sales increased 4% over the year-earlier period, with Rotary and Mission Systems growing 10% due to the delivery of an international pilot training system and ramping production of Sikorsky aircraft. Segment operating profit increased as a result of our sales performance, and earnings per share also saw strong growth. Our EPS benefited from gains in our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. LM Ventures make strategic investments in early stage companies developing disruptive cutting-edge technologies, and it supports our technology road maps and growth strategies. Ken will give a little more color on this in a few moments. Our cash generation remains outstanding, driving over $1.7 billion of cash from operations this quarter, which includes the nearly $1.4 billion downward impact of accelerating payments to our suppliers, including thousands of small and vulnerable companies that are especially stressed due to COVID-19 impacts. Altogether, these results reflect the high level of execution being achieved across the company. Our outstanding cash generation and strong balance sheet also provide us the flexibility to complete a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement this quarter to opportunistically buy back stock. We expect our cash generation to remain strong, and we plan to continue our balanced cash deployment actions by investing in innovative technologies, executing our 21st century warfare strategy, providing our customers with enhanced capabilities and returning cash to stockholders. Turning to federal budgets. As a reminder, the fiscal year 2021 budget cycle marked the final year of the Budget Control Act that was originally enacted in 2011. The Department of Defense appropriations approved as part of the FY 2021 omnibus funding bill resulted in a fully funded national defense budget of approximately $740 billion. The White House recently released their preliminary budget proposal for fiscal 2022, targeting approximate $11 billion top line increase for the Department of Defense, an indication of the desire for continued stability in national security funding, and in line with our expectations. Similarly, the President issued an interim national security strategic guidance document, which incorporates key elements such as diplomacy, economic development, innovation, and modernizing our military capabilities into a broad framework for addressing accelerating global challenges. This guidance document places emphasis on deterrence, investments in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and secure next gen 5G infrastructure as well as the need for having strong defense and intelligence capabilities. We believe this vision is well aligned with our 21st century warfare strategy and plays to the strength of our broad portfolio and our culture of innovation at Lockheed Martin. Also in the quarter, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package was enacted into legislation. This bill extended the CARES Act Section 3610 provision until September 30, 2021, enabling federal agencies to continue to reimburse contractors for the cost of keeping employees and subcontractors in a ready state as a result of the global pandemic. Importantly, this legislation also contained cash funding relief provisions affecting single employer pension plans, the primary reason for our increase in our cash outlook. Ken will discuss this further during his remarks. Turning to our business areas. I'd like to touch on several notable achievements demonstrating our focus on operational performance, strategic growth initiatives, and the strength of our portfolio. I'll begin with Aeronautics, where our team participated in this year's Orange Flag exercise. That's the U.S. Air Force's annual event to assess integration maturity of their war fighting platform. This year's Orange Flag featured a broad network-centric demonstration, showcasing the integration of the F-35 and other legacy aircraft, including the F-22 and U2, with long - land-based long-range fires, naval fires and space-based sensors. This exercise demonstrated a fully functional Internet of Things or IoT architecture, integrating a number of our nation's most advanced weapons systems. Our team was on the vanguard of this effort, enabling F-35s and F-22 to pass data to a U2, all Lockheed Martin aircraft, with the U2 then relaying the information to a ground-based control center. Targeting data was then transferred using machine-to-machine data sharing with an army engagement operations center as well as to navy ships. By providing data via fifth-generation aircraft to multiple command and control nodes, that information can be used for real-time targeting. This exercise demonstrated Lockheed Martin's readiness to provide unmatched situational awareness and to rapidly field capabilities today in support of our customers' joint all-domain operations concept.  In Rotary and Mission Systems, The CH-53K King Stallion was selected by the Israeli Ministry of Defense as the winner in their heavy lift helicopter competition. Upon contract award, our Sikorsky line of business will provide new CH-53Ks to replace the Israeli Air Force's current fleet of legacy Sikorsky 53-D aircraft. Israel will become the first international customer for our new 53-K variant, and we look forward to working with the Israeli Defense Force and the U.S. government to finalize the agreement. In our Missiles and Fire Control business area, the U.S. Army awarded our Precision Fires team a $2.8 billion contract for additional guided multiple launch rocket systems, or GMLRS, products and services that continue our relationships that's lasted for over 40 years. This quarter, MFC also delivered the 50,000 GMLR systems, another sign of the enduring demand of our signature programs. Moving to our space business area. The Missile Defense Agency down selected our space team for the next-generation interceptor program, awarding a $3.7 billion, five-year contract for technology development and risk reduction activities. This award leverages our internal investments and experience from our THAAD and other programs to deliver the capability to respond to multiple threats with a single interceptor. NGI will be a key element of homeland defense of our country against ballistic nuclear missiles, and we're extremely proud to be selected to pursue this opportunity. Our Space team also announced a strategic interest agreement with telecommunications firm omni space to explore collaborating on a hybrid communications network using both satellites and ground-based wireless technology. Tying together space and terrestrial systems into a seamless 5G network, has the potential to greatly enhance military applications and help manage complex information-centric warfare and all the operational domains. We continue to explore opportunities like this one with the goal of accelerating the benefits of commercial telecommunications technology into our 5G.mil initiative to rapidly increase the capabilities of our soldiers, sailors and airmen in the 21st century. I'll close by again highlighting Our space team and their contribution to the recent successful Mars Perseverance landing. Lockheed Martin Space designed and built the Mars 2020 Aero Shell, which encapsulated both the Perseverance Rover and the innovative Ingenuity drone helicopter, protecting them during entry and decent through the Martian atmosphere. Lockheed Martin also designed and built the Mars helicopter delivery system, which transported Ingenuity on the Rover and successfully deployed the helicopter for its historic first flights on Mars. We've built aeroshell systems for every one of NASA's Mars Rovers and Landers, and we've been part of every NASA Mars mission, beginning with the Viking program in the 1970s. We continue to incorporate innovative technologies and decades of experience into each new spacecraft, and we're excited to continue our Mars heritage with the Perseverance Program. These many achievements highlight the breadth of our portfolio, our focus on innovation and next gen technologies and our commitment to providing the United States and its allies with 21st century capabilities to support crucial, national security missions. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken.\nKen Possenriede: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter while maintaining our backlog of $147 billion. We generated $1.7 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our balanced cash deployment actions, including the execution of our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program this quarter, returning a total of $1.7 billion to our stockholders, including our quarterly dividend payments. With these results and strong performance from our Rotary and Mission Systems segment, we are able to increase our outlook for the year for all key financial metrics. And turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 4% compared with last year to $16.3 billion, continuing our expected growth of the business, while segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. We had the segment operating margin of 10.8%, consistent with our expectations as we did not record any equity earnings this quarter due to no-launch events in our ULA joint venture at Space. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for first quarter 2021. Our earnings per share of $6.56 was $0.48 above our results last year, driven by volume and, as Jim mentioned, includes $0.18 of a gain from investments in our ventures fund. And I'll discuss this a little more in a subsequent slide. This was partially offset by $0.10 in severance charges from previously announced actions taken to improve efficiency and lower total cost for our business. On Chart 6, we will discuss in more detail the cash return to our stockholders this quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.7 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was nearly $1.5 billion. By executing our planned share repurchases of $1 billion in the first quarter as well as providing our dividend of $2.60 per share, we were able to return 119% of free cash flow to our stockholders quarter. And moving on to Chart 7. As we noted, we are increasing our outlook for the current years for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. On Chart 8, we showed the increase to our sales guidance range of $200 million, and reflected in our estimated sales range for Rotary and Mission Systems. This increase reaffirms our growth for 2021 projected to increase year-over-year by 4%. On Chart 9, we show our outlook for segment operating profit by business area. And consistent with sales, we have increased our RMS in our outlook by $25 million. On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our increased guidance for 2021 earnings per share. As I noted a moment ago, we recorded a $68 million gain on strategic investments we hold in our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund, which translates to approximately $0.18 in earnings per share. As Jim noted previously, these investments are part of our growth strategy, focused on innovative technology and early stage companies and their valuations may fluctuate over time. Moving on, reduced tax expense as a result of the American Rescue Plan Act and the timing and execution of our share repurchases have also favorably impacted our outlook for EPS, as has the increased earnings we noted from Rotary and Mission Systems. There is an offset to incorporate the nonrecurring severance charge we discussed earlier. In total, our full year earnings per share outlook has increased by $0.40 at the midpoint of the range. On Chart 11, we will look at our increased cash flow forecast for 2021, and with increases also estimated for 2022 and 2023. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we are no longer planning to make a $1 billion discretionary pension contribution in 2021. This benefit is partially offset by reduced pension tax deductions with the net increase to cash estimated to be about $600 million. The net impact also improves our anticipated cash flow in '22 and '23. This change allows us to recover the entire $8.3 billion of existing CAS prefunding credits by 2026. And based upon this change in law and our current estimates and assumptions for future pension asset performance, we do not believe there will be a required pension cash contribution before the year 2026 and minimal contributions thereafter. In total, this change in legislation increases our three-year cash flow estimate by $1 billion, and combined with reduced future CAS expenses, will improve our cost competitiveness and our affordability to customers going forward. I should note, as I did on our last call that this outlook and trends are prior to an R&D tax deduction impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that's effective in 2022. And to conclude, on Chart 12, we have our summary. We believe that the first quarter of 2021 has laid the foundation for a strong year. Our backlog remains robust, and our key programs continue to deliver growth and sustained performance. We have increased our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And as a result of a change in legislation, our three-year cash flow expectations have grown by $1 billion. And with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And first with the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nRob Spingarn: I wanted to dig into space a little bit. Two-part question, one for each of you. And I thought I'd start with Ken. And just wondering how we think about top line growth for the three space subsegments, so satellite, strategic and defensive missiles and space transport over the next few years ex the AWE fade, particularly now that we have some budget details from NASA. And then, Jim, while we're on the topic of space and NASA and with the Artemis HLS award to SpaceX last week, and all of the other start-ups we're seeing, the new space crowd is coming on strong, and I wanted to ask you how you think about that from Lockheed's perspective. Thank you.\nKen Possenriede: Sure. Hey, Rob, it's Ken. I'll start off with your long-term question regarding top line growth. So everyone is aware, if you look at the last couple of years, we've had a very strong order book in our space business. Some of it planned and frankly, some of it nice surprises. So if you go around the horn - if you look at our National Security Space segment, I'd say probably the biggest growth opportunity we have there is, is in our classified space area. We are seeing an enormous amount of opportunities out there. A lot of them planned. And frankly, a lot of them that we are helping shape. And so I'd say, long term, there's a lot of opportunities there in national security space. From a strategic and missile defense standpoint, I would start out with what Jim described as a very nice win for us, which was the NGI contract. I think over the next couple of years, we're going to see some nice opportunity from a growth standpoint there that - that program will be developing and demonstrating JATO enabling systems, and they'll be ready for operational use as early as today. So some opportunities there. I'd say the second area of large top line growth opportunity is our hypersonics business. So if you think about hypersonics today, we're going to do about $1.5 billion, rough numbers, of sales in our hypersonics area. And roughly about two-thirds of that is in our space business. Think of that as CPS. So I think some strong opportunities there. And then commercial space, probably not as robust growth as the other two business segments, but we do see some opportunities there, and that's in light of Homeland Security. I'm also going to mention the one initiative with omni space that Jim brought up. I think there's some exciting opportunities there, not just in the government arena, but also in the commercial arena that will help shape with them. And then I think the last piece I'll talk about is our LM-100 initiative. This is a midsized satellite bus that can support missions to both LEO and GEO. And that will be joining our fleet of the LM-50 and the LM-2100 series. And some of those investments in advanced payload technologies and demonstrations, we'll be using that bus that can yield some future growth. So I think there are a lot of exciting opportunities there for us in space. It really is an opportunity-rich environment.\nJames Taiclet: And Rob, when it comes to space from a strategic standpoint, I think the important framework to start with here is that 80% or more of our space operations revenue comes in national security space and strategic missile defense. So the remaining 20% is where sort of the action is on exploration. And we're playing right in the middle of that. So we're on the - largely commercial team, led by Blue Origin and the national team on the moon lander. That our team did not particularly be successful in this, didn't mean we weren't participating. We were part and parcel of the new order, if you will, in civil space and teamed up with Blue Origin. On the other hand, we've got a franchise position on Orion. And Orion is the actual crew compartment spacecraft that will be used for the Artemis missions going forward. So we've got a great position there. We'll continue to work with whether it's omni space or others, Blue Origin, SpaceX, whatever makes sense for us from a partnership/competition perspective. We're going to play, and we're going to be there. But again, 80% of our system - Space Systems net revenue is going to be coming from, again, franchise situations and strategic missile defense and national security space where I'm not seeing those newer firms play at the level where they can compete with us.\nOperator: Our next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning. Your sort of vision for the company that you talked about would seem to require maybe some changes in the way that the department interacts with contractors. I guess, after being in the role for a year, what would you say are the top one or two changes that you need from the department to kind of really drive the 21st century warfare strategy? And what's the plan for getting those?\nJames Taiclet: Sure. Let me just frame up the strategy quickly for everyone on the call. And then for each of the sort of four or five main areas, I'll make a point as to what we hope to encourage and work with our government customer to do on their side. So overall, our objective is to lead our National Defense enterprise, which is industry and government and the military services toward a higher and faster trajectory of development. This is essential to meet the challenges, I think, in an area of resurgent great power competition. So this isn't just a business strategy. I think it's a national strategy that's an imperative. And at Lockheed Martin, we're in a great position to try to lead that with our customer base. And there's really four or five elements. And so I'll hit each element and say, well, what do we hope to get along with our behavior from our government customer and the military services to work with us on this. First of all, I think we - it's imperative. Again, we established what we call a 5G.mil network architecture. So something that is a standards-based architecture with interfaces, frequencies we're going to use, bands we're going to employ, ways to do hierarchies and use intellectual property from numerous companies inside and outside the defense enterprise to actually create an architecture just like you see being done in, say, 5G in the telecommunications world. I think we can lead that for a number of reasons, but we're going to absolutely have to have our government customer involved with us. And when you look at exercises like Orange Flag, that demonstrates that they see the need as well. And ultimately, we're going to have to have an ability to work with our customer base to have new acquisition and appropriations processes so that we can speed things up and get things done faster than the kind of world we're talking about. One of the things that frankly is a core competency of Lockheed Martin is dealing with the federal acquisition regulations and I do feel we can be a bridge, during the sort of changeover period, if you will, to commercial tech. We can license with them on one hand, the way they used to working and we'll deal with the federal government as far as the contracting goes on that side. I think we can be a great bridge for that. But the first thing we need to do is establish that architecture and have cooperation with our government customers to do it and we are. The second thing is we really intend to partner with these leading companies in the telecom and technology space, because we need as a defense enterprise to accelerate our adoption of those 21st century technologies and capabilities. So again, we'll try to be the pivot point for that, linking the two industries with our customer, but we're going to have to again have an interest in adapting procurement processes and speed to the kind of speed that the commercial companies are used to. There's an interesting model for this, the intelligence community, there are some budgets that are handled at the DNI level, which have a lot more flexibility than the standard DoD budget line would have. And so that's just one idea, but we need to start working with our customer closely on some of those fast-track kind of initiatives. The next piece of what we're going to do at Lockheed Martin is we're going to enable eventually all of our major platform programs in aerospace, maritime and land domains to seamlessly connect into this architecture. And then on the customer side, we're going to have to work with them to make sure that they're comfortable using the standards that we come up with and some of the software defined network protocols that we intend to use, we're going to work with them on that. Now why that's important is because, currently the sequential design test paradigm that the Department of Defense uses to develop weapon systems is too perfectionist and too slow to actually do this. And so we want to work with our government customers to use a more rapid development process. So for example, on hypersonics, we're already using it. We look for 80%, 20% kind of splits on success on all the test points and metrics, and we move on to the next test. We don't strive for 99% to 100% because that will be too slow to get this done. So there's a sequential design test paradigm change, frankly, that we have to work with our customers to achieve there too. And at the end of all this, why are we doing that? I think at the end of it all, our customers are going to achieve greater returns capability and operational abilities by moving toward this direction. And our shareholders are going to benefit too, because we're going to be a stronger and more resilient growth machine and engine for our business. So there's benefits to shareholders, there's benefits to government, and we hope to lead the charge on this.\nOperator: And our next question is from Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Stallard: Jim, there's been some commentary out of Congress over the last month or so about the F-35 and the operating cost of the aircraft. I was wondering if you can give us your perspectives on this issues? And what the obstacles could be to getting this operating cost down to an agreeable level? Thank you.\nJames Taiclet: Sure. So what I'll start with is an ex-Air Force pilot and have been spoken to Israeli pilots, and our own test pilots here at Lockheed Martin, and also those in serving in the military today in the United States, this aircraft is the most capable fighter plane ever developed in history. It's got a lot of leading-edge technology with it. Just the propulsion system alone integrated with the stealth technology is pretty groundbreaking. It enables this airplane to do things that no other one can do and survive in the process of that. The other piece of it is Lockheed Martin was the head of even my thinking in making sure that the F-35 would be ultimately a hybrid-based station or a mobile compute node for the battlefield. And so we've got the sensor capability, the computer processing power and the communication linkages from that airplane to the network. Again, that makes the airplane much more than just a single-purpose fighter. So having said all that, it's an expensive machine. It's expensive to maintain in large part because of the stealth technology that's more advanced than anywhere else. Having said all that, we are working on all three dimensions of affordability with the customer very closely, myself included. And that is on production, where we've already achieved - the company has already achieved the goal of $80 million F-35A, and we're $1million or $2 million below that these days. So production is in good shape. We're going to keep working on it. For modernization, this airplane, because of this evolving threat and the speed of which that's happening, is going to have to continually modernize. And if we can employ some of these commercial technology practices into our own modernization program, we'll be able to get some efficiencies out of that. And then sustainment is also key. And what we need to do is have a joint strategy and develop it with our program office and our services through the end customers that have to actually fix this aircraft and maintain it in the field to get the optimal sustainment strategy, the right level of funding for spare parts, etc., and really clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the depot system, for frontline maintenance and for the OEM and our supply chain. I think that's a very doable thing, and we're embarking on that led by the joint program office and the service team. So I think we're going to address all three dimensions. And that the goals that the government has put in place for us at $25,000 a flight hour, if we work with them in tandem, is achievable.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Ken, maybe just a high level one on the backlog, your target, I think, of $150 billion in 2021. Maybe if you could just walk us through some of the key moving pieces that you think they're going to allow you to get there? And anything to call out on the international front? And just, Jim, related to that, if you could also just comment if you're seeing any kind of changes in the administration on the international award front? Thanks.\nKen Possenriede: Hey, thanks. Good morning. So yes, from an order standpoint, you're right, Peter. We think if you look book-to-bill, it will be by the end of the year, it will be above 1, and we should be close to about $150 billion. A couple of the key awards that will get us going forward. There's a variety of F-35 orders. I'd say probably the one worth highlighting or the two worth highlighting is, if you recall, Lot 15 for F-35, we deferred the booking of that last year, and we moved that into this year. That's a big order. And in there, there is - just sticking with the international theme, there is a good size of not just U.S. airplanes, but also partner countries and FMS countries. The other big F-35 order, which is in the fourth quarter, would be Lot 16 production. And think of that as just ballpark $9 billion. And similar to Lot 15, it's got U.S. airplanes. It's got partner airplanes and FMS airplanes. In fact, when you start getting out into that time period, the partner and FMS percentage of aircraft starts getting close to roughly 50%. And so we still see continued demand there. We have a handful of other international aeronautics orders out there. There's a few F-16 orders. There's a few C-130 orders. Another key one will be the next tranche of CH-53K. That's Lot 5. We're expecting that order this year. There's a bunch of PAC-3, fiscal year buys that we're expecting this year. There is a reasonable size span order for the Space business, which is Australia. There's a few special programs out of space. So I would say we are extremely comfortable with our orders profile. I would say the only one that possibly could move out to the right would be the Lot 16 production order. And again, that will just be timing, the joint program office, and us get alignment on pricing. And in fact, just - I'll just bring up the point. I'm sure someone's going to want to talk about the pension change. But one of the rationales for us to quickly declare why we're going to implement the CAS adoption to 2022 was for us to get that into our forward-pricing rates into 2022 and beyond. Because in fairness to our customers, they're not going to conclude negotiations with us until we push that down to the - that benefit down to the business areas and into their forward pricing rate. So that was one of the key reasons we made that declaration now, and started in 2022 because that will help with the Lot 15 negotiations that are going on now and many other large negotiations we have going on now.\nJames Taiclet: And Peter, it's Jim. When it comes to the current administration's approach to international defense, I think there's really four important points to make. One is, the Biden administration clearly recognizes that we're all in the year of this resurgent great power competition and regional disruptive powers that are out there as well like Iran and North Korea. That's a world that's not going to get any more peaceful anytime soon, most likely. And so strong national defense is a priority of the administration, I believe, based on their own statements. Secondly, the Biden administration is reinforced and elevated the criticality of alliances to actually meet this kind of situation. And that again is a positive for international defense cooperation. The third item that I note is that there's a very experienced and capable foreign policy national security cadre of leaders, lifetime professionals, many of them in this space, and they know exactly what they're dealing with and how to make it work. And then fourth, yes, there's going to be some process alignment between the White House, the Department of the State Department of Defense and Congress on how to actually conduct all of this. But I do see strong opportunities going forward under this administration for international defense cooperation, and that would benefit Lockheed Martin I expect.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. Good morning. Ken, I wanted to pursue Aeronautics a little bit. I mean, sales were flat in the quarter. How much of that was due to having one less week in the quarter? Deliveries were like 17 versus 22 for the F-35 and you lost some revenues from taking the development contract down. So do we make up the shortage of revenues in the fourth quarter when we pick up the week? And if you could just get into a little bit more of the detail like I was just asking.\nKen Possenriede: Sure, George. Good morning. Yes, the main driver of why Aeronautics was flat, frankly, was - and this is non-COVID related. We had a sizable couple of hundred million dollar vendor invoice that we anticipated to hit in the first quarter. George, that actually hit - it hit already, so it hit in the month of April. So it was just - that was a timing event. So I'm not so certain 12 weeks versus 14 weeks is going to have that much of an impact. That was really more of a delay in the invoice from the first quarter to the second quarter. But just to give you a little color, in the first quarter, basically, F-35 was generally down. And that's mainly due to development being down. I'd say production on the whole was relatively flat and sustainment was up modestly. And then to your point, we're going to continue to see momentum in the quarter - in the upcoming quarters. And in fact, to your point, the largest quarter for Aeronautics is the fourth quarter. So yes, you will see some of that continue going into the fourth quarter. So I think it's fair just to say it was the vendor payment slip into the second quarter. Second quarter is a little less than the third and the fourth, but there - all three of them are, I would say, somewhat considerably higher than our first quarter. So thanks for the question.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: So in the quarter, Ken, you talked about 10.8% segment margins. I think a couple of years back, the corporation was doing 12%, north of 12%. So I wanted to ask about how you view the potential opportunity for mix and productivity to improve segment margins in a more difficult budget environment from here? Thanks.\nKen Possenriede: Thanks, David. You want to talk about beyond 2021, I assume?\nDavid Strauss: Exactly.\nKen Possenriede: Okay. So, yes, I think it's probably best we go around each of the four business areas. So if you look at the mix at Aeronautics, F-35 is still going to be a dominant piece of Aeronautics regardless of how quickly the rest of the segments of that business area growing, and I'll get into that in detail. But so if you just peel the onion on F-35. Jim mentioned when he answered the sustainability question, if you look at the three elements, a nice pleasant surprise for us, which is a good news story is, there is a demand still for added capability, added technology on the airplane that we - and our partner companies are working on. So we still see development being a decent size, relatively speaking, decent-sized piece of the portfolio. It's going to be cost plus, so dilutive, but we'll take it, which then takes us to production, which is still going to be the lion's share of that piece of the portfolio. And I've said this before, if we perform on our current contracts as we believe we should be able to, and we're able to get acceptable deals on our future LRIPs, there should be some margin opportunity there. The only thing I'd caution is, we're looking at our performance on Lot 12 through 14 now. And whether we do a risk retirement later this year, we want to see some more improvement there before we do that. So I think the point I just made is valid that the opportunity is there. We have to perform, and we're just keeping a close eye on that. And then sustainment is going to be the fastest-growing piece of this - part of the portfolio, and it will continue to grow. I mean, we're going to continue to stand up bases. We're going to continue need sparing. We will back on the follow-on modernization work we're doing in development. We'll have to retrofit some of those aircraft that are already in the field. But today, they're cost plus and our customers buying on an annual basis, which is the argument Jim made, is inefficient. There's going to have to be - we believe there's a better way to procure, and that's why we offered that performance-based logistics concept and we'll see where that goes, if that morphs into something. And if industry is prepared as we are to take on the investment and take on the risk and sign up to a service-level agreement, and we perform, there should be some profit opportunities there. F-16, we've got 128 aircraft in backlog, five customers. We have - we see a lot of interest out there internationally from many, many countries. We're going to deliver eight aircraft next year. And we will, basically, by the middle of this decade, ramp up to about three, 3.5 airplane deliveries per month. There should be - and they're all FMS contracts. That's the way the customer is procuring them today. There should be some margin opportunity there for us. And then the last piece of Aeronautics is our Skunk Works. And it is our fastest-growing piece of Aeronautics, likely will be in the foreseeable future. But a lot of those contracts are classified. A lot of them are cost plus. Again, maybe margin erosion, but I'll take the top line growth with the added profit any day. So that's Aeronautics. Missiles and Fire Control, I think we have the opportunity to keep the margins where they are today. We do have a little bit of a mix issue. We should continue to see strong demand for PAC-3s into the foreseeable future. We're continuing to build out real estate to continue with the needed demand out there. And then the other piece that is going to continue to be quite large and continue to grow is in the classified area, which today is cost plus, will be in the foreseeable future, which will have a dilutive effect on margins, but we'll take that any day. And ultimately, that should morph into production and fixed price and allow us to grow margins there. At RMS, I think it's probably best to talk about Sikorsky. We're starting to see the CH-53K go into production. Jim in his prepared comments talked about some of the international opportunities, specifically Israel we have there, which will be a great opportunity for us. A lot of these other helicopter programs are now into production. And then ultimately, we'll have to down-select on FLRAA and FARA and we're bullish on those. And by the end of this decade, it will start - they'll start out as development programs. By the end of this decade, they'll be in production as well and hopefully see some margin improvements there. And then lastly, Space. Space, if it wasn't for AWE, they would be our fastest-growing business area this year at 7%. And we should see, with our core space business, we should continue to see growth there. It will be a mix between cost plus and fixed price. United Launch Alliance is alive and well, and will continue to be, and will give us a nice equity earnings stream. But I see some - based on where we are today, I see some margin upside there as well based on where they are today.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rich Safran with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.\nRich Safran: So given the accelerated share repurchases, I wanted to ask you again about capital deployment and just how you're thinking about it. Does the accelerated share repurchase infer any change in how you're thinking about the balance between dividends, buybacks and M&A? And on that topic, is there any intent to continue to or make larger investments in businesses and technologies like ABL?\nKen Possenriede: Okay. Hey, Rich, it's Ken. Hopefully, this will resonate with you, but I think it's a consistent story. First and foremost, we're going to generate as much cash as we can, and that was one of the rationales of why we decided to start deferring our ERISA funding in 2021 from an economic standpoint. That made the most sense. But first and foremost, we're going to invest in our business, whether that's organic or inorganically. We have still some decent-sized capital outlays this year of, rough numbers, about $1.8 billion. We're at record levels of IRAD spend this year, and we'll continue to do that. And we'll - this - again, we'll focus on organic. And then inorganically, in Jim's prepared statements, we talked about Aerojet Rocketdyne. That's on-track. We just got our second request from the FTC, which is no surprise. Nothing has changed. We're still very bullish about that for that to come to resolution in the fourth quarter of this year. And then it comes down to the excess cash, what do we do with it? We are focused on our dividend strategy. That would be the next in the batting order. We're going to - in the third quarter, Jim and I will go see the Board with our Treasurer, John Mallard, to make a recommendation on what's the appropriate increase in our dividends, and it should be deemed favorable to our shareholders. And then lastly, it's share buybacks. And frankly, Rich, what we saw in the first quarter where our stock was trading, we thought it was grossly undervalued, and we went into this accelerated share buyback plan and deemed to be very successful. And we will opportunistically, in the next three quarters, buy back stock where it makes sense. And think of that as anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion in the next three months. We have the balance sheet to do everything I just described, and we'll continue evaluating that. And I'll hand it over to Jim to talk about if there's any other investments in - I think you mentioned ABL and other type opportunities out there.\nJames Taiclet: Yes, Rich. And going back to that overall strategic framework that I outlined earlier, you hear a lot in there about partnering with leading technology companies, leveraging commercial industry research and development investments. They've already made or are making to reduce our costs that we then transmit to our customer. So we want to use the full range of transactional options with inclusive of our defense industrial-based colleagues that we're used to dealing with, but well beyond that, right? So ABL is more of a kind of a bulk-buy-option type commercial agreement, for example, which is maybe the lowest on the spectrum of what you might do all the way up through partnerships, which are like-for-like contributions, joint ventures, which are actual equity agreements with different companies like we have with ULA, for example. And then full-on acquisitions like Aerojet Rocketdyne or i3, which is a smaller tech company that we bought last year. So we're going to use that full range of transactional options to pursue the strategy that I talked about. So you'll see us be, I think, a little more creative at times a more open aperture. But it will be thoughtful. It will all fit within the batting order that Ken just described. But we're going to make sure that we're being widely viewing the options so that we can take advantage of cost reduction of R&D that's made in other sectors or of other business models. So just one last point on this, some of that's already going to invest in low-orbit at scale production for commercial uses, well, maybe we could tap into some of that - their production for military and defense uses. And again, let them do the capex investment, and we'll just commercially buy off what we need from them, which is similar to ABLs agreement.\nOperator: And our next question is from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: How has the relationship with ABL evolved since initially investing in the company? And also, what does an exit of an investment look like at LM Ventures? Will you eventually acquire them, sell your stake or IPO? How do you look at that?\nKen Possenriede: Hey, Kristine, it's Ken. We really didn't make an investment in ABL. What we basically agreed to is to commit to a range of launch vehicles. And think of this for lower-level satellites that don't require the horsepower of, say, our United Launch Alliance. The only investment we do have is it's in our Ventures group. And think of that as this is more for the technology that they bring to make our products better. And it's a relatively modest - that's a relatively modest investment. So I'm not sure I would look at it as something that from an acquisition standpoint. And the question you asked for when do we look at getting out of those type investments? So we did - as you heard, we did have some investments that actually went public, that allowed us to make a gain. Some of those are back, which we're going to be required to hold, and then we'll make a determination whether it makes sense for Lockheed Martin to get out of those ventures, but then to continue to utilize that technology. And just as an example, ABL, we would do something very similar. And again, I'm not suggesting that whether they're public or not. We would just make a determination when it makes sense for that modest investment in them, that we have whether it makes sense for us to get out or not and just continue to utilize their technologies.\nGreg Gardner: John, this is Greg. I think we have time for one more.\nOperator: And that will be from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: So help me think about this. In the quarter, right, F-35 volume was down and F-22 volume was down. And I think about those as kind of the underlying foundation of the company. How can we get comfortable that that's not going to be a trend that - I mean that growth engine is still healthy in there?\nKen Possenriede: Sure. I'll take that, Ron. Good morning. I think a little bit goes back to what George was asking me in terms of the first quarter versus the rest of it. So I would say on production, we're down - it's - I'm going to call it flat, Ron, just because it's down year-over-year, $25 million. But what we're basically looking at on development on the whole - and this goes back to the earlier conversation. This in some ways is for Lockheed Martin is a good problem to have, we continue to have that demand out there for increasing technology, but I don't see development growing. So let's, for year-over-year, call it, flat production. just based on - if you think about production revenues, it's really not for the most part, it's really not for the deliveries we're making this year, which are Lot 12 and Lot 13. It's really for the deliveries we're making next year. We're building those aircraft out now for next year. And then we're doing the buy ahead, if you will, for the following year. That's generally where the sales are coming for this year. And we're fairly confident - we're very confident, I should say, in the stream and the flow of what's going on. So think of production is going to grow this year low single digits. And I've been relaying that sales are going to continue to grow at a relatively slow pace for production. The growth is in sustainment. And in the quarter, we did see growth in sustainment, and we will see growth for the year in the - close to the almost 10% range. So I don't think that's a concern. I think F-22 - I'm not sure you called that the linchpin or the bedrock of the business area. I'd say, Ron, relatively speaking, F-16 is almost double the size of F-22. I think that's more of the parameter of where the rest of aeronautics is going, including the Skunk Works. I would say F-22 is going to continue to be flat and declining as well C-130, and the pleasant surprise on C-130 is it's not declining as quickly as we thought it was. The team has done a nice job of getting congressional adds from the United States government and international customers for that great workhorse. And that's going to be flat over time. So I'd say your big drivers going forward for growth at Aeronautics will be sustainment on F-35, F-16 and then the Skunk Works and then the bedrock, if you will, will be the modest growth that we're going to have going forward on production.\nGreg Gardner: John, this is Greg. I think we've come up on the top of the hour here, so I will turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\nJames Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Lockheed Martin had a strong first quarter, delivering outstanding performance operationally for our customers, providing continued growth and value for you, the stockholders too, and I want to just close by reiterating my thanks to the Lockheed Martin team for their dedication and commitment to excellence during a difficult time for everyone. And thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. And that concludes the call for today. Thanks again, everybody.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today on our first quarter 2021 earnings call. As today's release illustrates, we had a strong financial results this quarter, and continue to perform at a high level strategically and operationally. Our achievements reflect the quality of our workforce, the breadth of our products and services and the focus we all have on delivering value to our customers and stockholders. We continue to deliver these results in spite of the ongoing difficulties presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. And my thanks go to the men and women of Lockheed Martin for their outstanding contributions during these challenging times. I'll begin today with a quick update on the strategic acquisition of Aerojet Rocketdyne that we announced in December, a transaction we believe will enhance Lockheed Martin's ability to develop and supply advanced products in support of national security and our civil space objectives. We also plan to strengthen Aerojet Rocketdyne's capabilities as a merchant supplier with improved offerings for all of its industry and government customer, which is a critical component of closing our acquisition business case. Last month, Aerojet stockholders approved the merger agreement with over 99% of votes cast being in favor of the transaction. Also, this quarter, as expected, both companies received a request for additional information or a second request from the Federal Trade Commission as part of the regulatory review process. The second request extends the waiting period pursuant to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. We're working cooperatively with the FTC and continue to expect resolution of the regulatory review process by the latter part of 2021. Moving to our financial and operational results. Lockheed Martin got off to a strong start for the year. Ken will discuss our financial results in more detail and provide an update to our 2021 financial outlook, which increases key financial metrics across the board. But I'd like to continue by providing a few highlights right up front. First quarter sales increased 4% over the year-earlier period, with Rotary and Mission Systems growing 10% due to the delivery of an international pilot training system and ramping production of Sikorsky aircraft. Segment operating profit increased as a result of our sales performance, and earnings per share also saw strong growth. Our EPS benefited from gains in our Lockheed Martin Ventures Fund. LM Ventures make strategic investments in early stage companies developing disruptive cutting-edge technologies, and it supports our technology road maps and growth strategies. Ken will give a little more color on this in a few moments. Our cash generation remains outstanding, driving over $1.7 billion of cash from operations this quarter, which includes the nearly $1.4 billion downward impact of accelerating payments to our suppliers, including thousands of small and vulnerable companies that are especially stressed due to COVID-19 impacts. Altogether, these results reflect the high level of execution being achieved across the company. Our outstanding cash generation and strong balance sheet also provide us the flexibility to complete a $1 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement this quarter to opportunistically buy back stock. We expect our cash generation to remain strong, and we plan to continue our balanced cash deployment actions by investing in innovative technologies, executing our 21st century warfare strategy, providing our customers with enhanced capabilities and returning cash to stockholders. Turning to federal budgets. As a reminder, the fiscal year 2021 budget cycle marked the final year of the Budget Control Act that was originally enacted in 2011. The Department of Defense appropriations approved as part of the FY 2021 omnibus funding bill resulted in a fully funded national defense budget of approximately $740 billion. The White House recently released their preliminary budget proposal for fiscal 2022, targeting approximate $11 billion top line increase for the Department of Defense, an indication of the desire for continued stability in national security funding, and in line with our expectations. Similarly, the President issued an interim national security strategic guidance document, which incorporates key elements such as diplomacy, economic development, innovation, and modernizing our military capabilities into a broad framework for addressing accelerating global challenges. This guidance document places emphasis on deterrence, investments in emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, and secure next gen 5G infrastructure as well as the need for having strong defense and intelligence capabilities. We believe this vision is well aligned with our 21st century warfare strategy and plays to the strength of our broad portfolio and our culture of innovation at Lockheed Martin. Also in the quarter, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 stimulus package was enacted into legislation. This bill extended the CARES Act Section 3610 provision until September 30, 2021, enabling federal agencies to continue to reimburse contractors for the cost of keeping employees and subcontractors in a ready state as a result of the global pandemic. Importantly, this legislation also contained cash funding relief provisions affecting single employer pension plans, the primary reason for our increase in our cash outlook. Ken will discuss this further during his remarks. Turning to our business areas. I'd like to touch on several notable achievements demonstrating our focus on operational performance, strategic growth initiatives, and the strength of our portfolio. I'll begin with Aeronautics, where our team participated in this year's Orange Flag exercise. That's the U.S. Air Force's annual event to assess integration maturity of their war fighting platform. This year's Orange Flag featured a broad network-centric demonstration, showcasing the integration of the F-35 and other legacy aircraft, including the F-22 and U2, with long - land-based long-range fires, naval fires and space-based sensors. This exercise demonstrated a fully functional Internet of Things or IoT architecture, integrating a number of our nation's most advanced weapons systems. Our team was on the vanguard of this effort, enabling F-35s and F-22 to pass data to a U2, all Lockheed Martin aircraft, with the U2 then relaying the information to a ground-based control center. Targeting data was then transferred using machine-to-machine data sharing with an army engagement operations center as well as to navy ships. By providing data via fifth-generation aircraft to multiple command and control nodes, that information can be used for real-time targeting. This exercise demonstrated Lockheed Martin's readiness to provide unmatched situational awareness and to rapidly field capabilities today in support of our customers' joint all-domain operations concept.  In Rotary and Mission Systems, The CH-53K King Stallion was selected by the Israeli Ministry of Defense as the winner in their heavy lift helicopter competition. Upon contract award, our Sikorsky line of business will provide new CH-53Ks to replace the Israeli Air Force's current fleet of legacy Sikorsky 53-D aircraft. Israel will become the first international customer for our new 53-K variant, and we look forward to working with the Israeli Defense Force and the U.S. government to finalize the agreement. In our Missiles and Fire Control business area, the U.S. Army awarded our Precision Fires team a $2.8 billion contract for additional guided multiple launch rocket systems, or GMLRS, products and services that continue our relationships that's lasted for over 40 years. This quarter, MFC also delivered the 50,000 GMLR systems, another sign of the enduring demand of our signature programs. Moving to our space business area. The Missile Defense Agency down selected our space team for the next-generation interceptor program, awarding a $3.7 billion, five-year contract for technology development and risk reduction activities. This award leverages our internal investments and experience from our THAAD and other programs to deliver the capability to respond to multiple threats with a single interceptor. NGI will be a key element of homeland defense of our country against ballistic nuclear missiles, and we're extremely proud to be selected to pursue this opportunity. Our Space team also announced a strategic interest agreement with telecommunications firm omni space to explore collaborating on a hybrid communications network using both satellites and ground-based wireless technology. Tying together space and terrestrial systems into a seamless 5G network, has the potential to greatly enhance military applications and help manage complex information-centric warfare and all the operational domains. We continue to explore opportunities like this one with the goal of accelerating the benefits of commercial telecommunications technology into our 5G.mil initiative to rapidly increase the capabilities of our soldiers, sailors and airmen in the 21st century. I'll close by again highlighting Our space team and their contribution to the recent successful Mars Perseverance landing. Lockheed Martin Space designed and built the Mars 2020 Aero Shell, which encapsulated both the Perseverance Rover and the innovative Ingenuity drone helicopter, protecting them during entry and decent through the Martian atmosphere. Lockheed Martin also designed and built the Mars helicopter delivery system, which transported Ingenuity on the Rover and successfully deployed the helicopter for its historic first flights on Mars. We've built aeroshell systems for every one of NASA's Mars Rovers and Landers, and we've been part of every NASA Mars mission, beginning with the Viking program in the 1970s. We continue to incorporate innovative technologies and decades of experience into each new spacecraft, and we're excited to continue our Mars heritage with the Perseverance Program. These many achievements highlight the breadth of our portfolio, our focus on innovation and next gen technologies and our commitment to providing the United States and its allies with 21st century capabilities to support crucial, national security missions. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. And Rob, when it comes to space from a strategic standpoint, I think the important framework to start with here is that 80% or more of our space operations revenue comes in national security space and strategic missile defense. So the remaining 20% is where sort of the action is on exploration. And we're playing right in the middle of that. So we're on the - largely commercial team, led by Blue Origin and the national team on the moon lander. That our team did not particularly be successful in this, didn't mean we weren't participating. We were part and parcel of the new order, if you will, in civil space and teamed up with Blue Origin. On the other hand, we've got a franchise position on Orion. And Orion is the actual crew compartment spacecraft that will be used for the Artemis missions going forward. So we've got a great position there. We'll continue to work with whether it's omni space or others, Blue Origin, SpaceX, whatever makes sense for us from a partnership/competition perspective. We're going to play, and we're going to be there. But again, 80% of our system - Space Systems net revenue is going to be coming from, again, franchise situations and strategic missile defense and national security space where I'm not seeing those newer firms play at the level where they can compete with us. Sure. Let me just frame up the strategy quickly for everyone on the call. And then for each of the sort of four or five main areas, I'll make a point as to what we hope to encourage and work with our government customer to do on their side. So overall, our objective is to lead our National Defense enterprise, which is industry and government and the military services toward a higher and faster trajectory of development. This is essential to meet the challenges, I think, in an area of resurgent great power competition. So this isn't just a business strategy. I think it's a national strategy that's an imperative. And at Lockheed Martin, we're in a great position to try to lead that with our customer base. And there's really four or five elements. And so I'll hit each element and say, well, what do we hope to get along with our behavior from our government customer and the military services to work with us on this. First of all, I think we - it's imperative. Again, we established what we call a 5G.mil network architecture. So something that is a standards-based architecture with interfaces, frequencies we're going to use, bands we're going to employ, ways to do hierarchies and use intellectual property from numerous companies inside and outside the defense enterprise to actually create an architecture just like you see being done in, say, 5G in the telecommunications world. I think we can lead that for a number of reasons, but we're going to absolutely have to have our government customer involved with us. And when you look at exercises like Orange Flag, that demonstrates that they see the need as well. And ultimately, we're going to have to have an ability to work with our customer base to have new acquisition and appropriations processes so that we can speed things up and get things done faster than the kind of world we're talking about. One of the things that frankly is a core competency of Lockheed Martin is dealing with the federal acquisition regulations and I do feel we can be a bridge, during the sort of changeover period, if you will, to commercial tech. We can license with them on one hand, the way they used to working and we'll deal with the federal government as far as the contracting goes on that side. I think we can be a great bridge for that. But the first thing we need to do is establish that architecture and have cooperation with our government customers to do it and we are. The second thing is we really intend to partner with these leading companies in the telecom and technology space, because we need as a defense enterprise to accelerate our adoption of those 21st century technologies and capabilities. So again, we'll try to be the pivot point for that, linking the two industries with our customer, but we're going to have to again have an interest in adapting procurement processes and speed to the kind of speed that the commercial companies are used to. There's an interesting model for this, the intelligence community, there are some budgets that are handled at the DNI level, which have a lot more flexibility than the standard DoD budget line would have. And so that's just one idea, but we need to start working with our customer closely on some of those fast-track kind of initiatives. The next piece of what we're going to do at Lockheed Martin is we're going to enable eventually all of our major platform programs in aerospace, maritime and land domains to seamlessly connect into this architecture. And then on the customer side, we're going to have to work with them to make sure that they're comfortable using the standards that we come up with and some of the software defined network protocols that we intend to use, we're going to work with them on that. Now why that's important is because, currently the sequential design test paradigm that the Department of Defense uses to develop weapon systems is too perfectionist and too slow to actually do this. And so we want to work with our government customers to use a more rapid development process. So for example, on hypersonics, we're already using it. We look for 80%, 20% kind of splits on success on all the test points and metrics, and we move on to the next test. We don't strive for 99% to 100% because that will be too slow to get this done. So there's a sequential design test paradigm change, frankly, that we have to work with our customers to achieve there too. And at the end of all this, why are we doing that? I think at the end of it all, our customers are going to achieve greater returns capability and operational abilities by moving toward this direction. And our shareholders are going to benefit too, because we're going to be a stronger and more resilient growth machine and engine for our business. So there's benefits to shareholders, there's benefits to government, and we hope to lead the charge on this. Sure. So what I'll start with is an ex-Air Force pilot and have been spoken to Israeli pilots, and our own test pilots here at Lockheed Martin, and also those in serving in the military today in the United States, this aircraft is the most capable fighter plane ever developed in history. It's got a lot of leading-edge technology with it. Just the propulsion system alone integrated with the stealth technology is pretty groundbreaking. It enables this airplane to do things that no other one can do and survive in the process of that. The other piece of it is Lockheed Martin was the head of even my thinking in making sure that the F-35 would be ultimately a hybrid-based station or a mobile compute node for the battlefield. And so we've got the sensor capability, the computer processing power and the communication linkages from that airplane to the network. Again, that makes the airplane much more than just a single-purpose fighter. So having said all that, it's an expensive machine. It's expensive to maintain in large part because of the stealth technology that's more advanced than anywhere else. Having said all that, we are working on all three dimensions of affordability with the customer very closely, myself included. And that is on production, where we've already achieved - the company has already achieved the goal of $80 million F-35A, and we're $1million or $2 million below that these days. So production is in good shape. We're going to keep working on it. For modernization, this airplane, because of this evolving threat and the speed of which that's happening, is going to have to continually modernize. And if we can employ some of these commercial technology practices into our own modernization program, we'll be able to get some efficiencies out of that. And then sustainment is also key. And what we need to do is have a joint strategy and develop it with our program office and our services through the end customers that have to actually fix this aircraft and maintain it in the field to get the optimal sustainment strategy, the right level of funding for spare parts, etc., and really clearly defined roles and responsibilities for the depot system, for frontline maintenance and for the OEM and our supply chain. I think that's a very doable thing, and we're embarking on that led by the joint program office and the service team. So I think we're going to address all three dimensions. And that the goals that the government has put in place for us at $25,000 a flight hour, if we work with them in tandem, is achievable. And Peter, it's Jim. When it comes to the current administration's approach to international defense, I think there's really four important points to make. One is, the Biden administration clearly recognizes that we're all in the year of this resurgent great power competition and regional disruptive powers that are out there as well like Iran and North Korea. That's a world that's not going to get any more peaceful anytime soon, most likely. And so strong national defense is a priority of the administration, I believe, based on their own statements. Secondly, the Biden administration is reinforced and elevated the criticality of alliances to actually meet this kind of situation. And that again is a positive for international defense cooperation. The third item that I note is that there's a very experienced and capable foreign policy national security cadre of leaders, lifetime professionals, many of them in this space, and they know exactly what they're dealing with and how to make it work. And then fourth, yes, there's going to be some process alignment between the White House, the Department of the State Department of Defense and Congress on how to actually conduct all of this. But I do see strong opportunities going forward under this administration for international defense cooperation, and that would benefit Lockheed Martin I expect. Yes, Rich. And going back to that overall strategic framework that I outlined earlier, you hear a lot in there about partnering with leading technology companies, leveraging commercial industry research and development investments. They've already made or are making to reduce our costs that we then transmit to our customer. So we want to use the full range of transactional options with inclusive of our defense industrial-based colleagues that we're used to dealing with, but well beyond that, right? So ABL is more of a kind of a bulk-buy-option type commercial agreement, for example, which is maybe the lowest on the spectrum of what you might do all the way up through partnerships, which are like-for-like contributions, joint ventures, which are actual equity agreements with different companies like we have with ULA, for example. And then full-on acquisitions like Aerojet Rocketdyne or i3, which is a smaller tech company that we bought last year. So we're going to use that full range of transactional options to pursue the strategy that I talked about. So you'll see us be, I think, a little more creative at times a more open aperture. But it will be thoughtful. It will all fit within the batting order that Ken just described. But we're going to make sure that we're being widely viewing the options so that we can take advantage of cost reduction of R&D that's made in other sectors or of other business models. So just one last point on this, some of that's already going to invest in low-orbit at scale production for commercial uses, well, maybe we could tap into some of that - their production for military and defense uses. And again, let them do the capex investment, and we'll just commercially buy off what we need from them, which is similar to ABLs agreement. Thanks, Greg. Lockheed Martin had a strong first quarter, delivering outstanding performance operationally for our customers, providing continued growth and value for you, the stockholders too, and I want to just close by reiterating my thanks to the Lockheed Martin team for their dedication and commitment to excellence during a difficult time for everyone. And thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. And that concludes the call for today. Thanks again, everybody."

            "name": "Ken Possenriede",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we've included with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. We saw strong results in sales, segment operating profit, cash from operations and earnings per share this quarter while maintaining our backlog of $147 billion. We generated $1.7 billion of cash from operations, and we continued our balanced cash deployment actions, including the execution of our $1 billion accelerated share repurchase program this quarter, returning a total of $1.7 billion to our stockholders, including our quarterly dividend payments. With these results and strong performance from our Rotary and Mission Systems segment, we are able to increase our outlook for the year for all key financial metrics. And turning to Chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this year with last year's results. Sales grew 4% compared with last year to $16.3 billion, continuing our expected growth of the business, while segment operating profit was $1.7 billion. We had the segment operating margin of 10.8%, consistent with our expectations as we did not record any equity earnings this quarter due to no-launch events in our ULA joint venture at Space. Chart 5 shows our earnings per share for first quarter 2021. Our earnings per share of $6.56 was $0.48 above our results last year, driven by volume and, as Jim mentioned, includes $0.18 of a gain from investments in our ventures fund. And I'll discuss this a little more in a subsequent slide. This was partially offset by $0.10 in severance charges from previously announced actions taken to improve efficiency and lower total cost for our business. On Chart 6, we will discuss in more detail the cash return to our stockholders this quarter. Subtracting our capital expenditures from approximately $1.7 billion of cash from operations, our free cash flow was nearly $1.5 billion. By executing our planned share repurchases of $1 billion in the first quarter as well as providing our dividend of $2.60 per share, we were able to return 119% of free cash flow to our stockholders quarter. And moving on to Chart 7. As we noted, we are increasing our outlook for the current years for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. On Chart 8, we showed the increase to our sales guidance range of $200 million, and reflected in our estimated sales range for Rotary and Mission Systems. This increase reaffirms our growth for 2021 projected to increase year-over-year by 4%. On Chart 9, we show our outlook for segment operating profit by business area. And consistent with sales, we have increased our RMS in our outlook by $25 million. On Chart 10, we take a closer look at our increased guidance for 2021 earnings per share. As I noted a moment ago, we recorded a $68 million gain on strategic investments we hold in our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund, which translates to approximately $0.18 in earnings per share. As Jim noted previously, these investments are part of our growth strategy, focused on innovative technology and early stage companies and their valuations may fluctuate over time. Moving on, reduced tax expense as a result of the American Rescue Plan Act and the timing and execution of our share repurchases have also favorably impacted our outlook for EPS, as has the increased earnings we noted from Rotary and Mission Systems. There is an offset to incorporate the nonrecurring severance charge we discussed earlier. In total, our full year earnings per share outlook has increased by $0.40 at the midpoint of the range. On Chart 11, we will look at our increased cash flow forecast for 2021, and with increases also estimated for 2022 and 2023. With the passage of the American Rescue Plan Act, we are no longer planning to make a $1 billion discretionary pension contribution in 2021. This benefit is partially offset by reduced pension tax deductions with the net increase to cash estimated to be about $600 million. The net impact also improves our anticipated cash flow in '22 and '23. This change allows us to recover the entire $8.3 billion of existing CAS prefunding credits by 2026. And based upon this change in law and our current estimates and assumptions for future pension asset performance, we do not believe there will be a required pension cash contribution before the year 2026 and minimal contributions thereafter. In total, this change in legislation increases our three-year cash flow estimate by $1 billion, and combined with reduced future CAS expenses, will improve our cost competitiveness and our affordability to customers going forward. I should note, as I did on our last call that this outlook and trends are prior to an R&D tax deduction impact from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that's effective in 2022. And to conclude, on Chart 12, we have our summary. We believe that the first quarter of 2021 has laid the foundation for a strong year. Our backlog remains robust, and our key programs continue to deliver growth and sustained performance. We have increased our full year outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. And as a result of a change in legislation, our three-year cash flow expectations have grown by $1 billion. And with that, John, we're ready to begin the Q&A. Sure. Hey, Rob, it's Ken. I'll start off with your long-term question regarding top line growth. So everyone is aware, if you look at the last couple of years, we've had a very strong order book in our space business. Some of it planned and frankly, some of it nice surprises. So if you go around the horn - if you look at our National Security Space segment, I'd say probably the biggest growth opportunity we have there is, is in our classified space area. We are seeing an enormous amount of opportunities out there. A lot of them planned. And frankly, a lot of them that we are helping shape. And so I'd say, long term, there's a lot of opportunities there in national security space. From a strategic and missile defense standpoint, I would start out with what Jim described as a very nice win for us, which was the NGI contract. I think over the next couple of years, we're going to see some nice opportunity from a growth standpoint there that - that program will be developing and demonstrating JATO enabling systems, and they'll be ready for operational use as early as today. So some opportunities there. I'd say the second area of large top line growth opportunity is our hypersonics business. So if you think about hypersonics today, we're going to do about $1.5 billion, rough numbers, of sales in our hypersonics area. And roughly about two-thirds of that is in our space business. Think of that as CPS. So I think some strong opportunities there. And then commercial space, probably not as robust growth as the other two business segments, but we do see some opportunities there, and that's in light of Homeland Security. I'm also going to mention the one initiative with omni space that Jim brought up. I think there's some exciting opportunities there, not just in the government arena, but also in the commercial arena that will help shape with them. And then I think the last piece I'll talk about is our LM-100 initiative. This is a midsized satellite bus that can support missions to both LEO and GEO. And that will be joining our fleet of the LM-50 and the LM-2100 series. And some of those investments in advanced payload technologies and demonstrations, we'll be using that bus that can yield some future growth. So I think there are a lot of exciting opportunities there for us in space. It really is an opportunity-rich environment. Hey, thanks. Good morning. So yes, from an order standpoint, you're right, Peter. We think if you look book-to-bill, it will be by the end of the year, it will be above 1, and we should be close to about $150 billion. A couple of the key awards that will get us going forward. There's a variety of F-35 orders. I'd say probably the one worth highlighting or the two worth highlighting is, if you recall, Lot 15 for F-35, we deferred the booking of that last year, and we moved that into this year. That's a big order. And in there, there is - just sticking with the international theme, there is a good size of not just U.S. airplanes, but also partner countries and FMS countries. The other big F-35 order, which is in the fourth quarter, would be Lot 16 production. And think of that as just ballpark $9 billion. And similar to Lot 15, it's got U.S. airplanes. It's got partner airplanes and FMS airplanes. In fact, when you start getting out into that time period, the partner and FMS percentage of aircraft starts getting close to roughly 50%. And so we still see continued demand there. We have a handful of other international aeronautics orders out there. There's a few F-16 orders. There's a few C-130 orders. Another key one will be the next tranche of CH-53K. That's Lot 5. We're expecting that order this year. There's a bunch of PAC-3, fiscal year buys that we're expecting this year. There is a reasonable size span order for the Space business, which is Australia. There's a few special programs out of space. So I would say we are extremely comfortable with our orders profile. I would say the only one that possibly could move out to the right would be the Lot 16 production order. And again, that will just be timing, the joint program office, and us get alignment on pricing. And in fact, just - I'll just bring up the point. I'm sure someone's going to want to talk about the pension change. But one of the rationales for us to quickly declare why we're going to implement the CAS adoption to 2022 was for us to get that into our forward-pricing rates into 2022 and beyond. Because in fairness to our customers, they're not going to conclude negotiations with us until we push that down to the - that benefit down to the business areas and into their forward pricing rate. So that was one of the key reasons we made that declaration now, and started in 2022 because that will help with the Lot 15 negotiations that are going on now and many other large negotiations we have going on now. Sure, George. Good morning. Yes, the main driver of why Aeronautics was flat, frankly, was - and this is non-COVID related. We had a sizable couple of hundred million dollar vendor invoice that we anticipated to hit in the first quarter. George, that actually hit - it hit already, so it hit in the month of April. So it was just - that was a timing event. So I'm not so certain 12 weeks versus 14 weeks is going to have that much of an impact. That was really more of a delay in the invoice from the first quarter to the second quarter. But just to give you a little color, in the first quarter, basically, F-35 was generally down. And that's mainly due to development being down. I'd say production on the whole was relatively flat and sustainment was up modestly. And then to your point, we're going to continue to see momentum in the quarter - in the upcoming quarters. And in fact, to your point, the largest quarter for Aeronautics is the fourth quarter. So yes, you will see some of that continue going into the fourth quarter. So I think it's fair just to say it was the vendor payment slip into the second quarter. Second quarter is a little less than the third and the fourth, but there - all three of them are, I would say, somewhat considerably higher than our first quarter. So thanks for the question. Thanks, David. You want to talk about beyond 2021, I assume? Okay. So, yes, I think it's probably best we go around each of the four business areas. So if you look at the mix at Aeronautics, F-35 is still going to be a dominant piece of Aeronautics regardless of how quickly the rest of the segments of that business area growing, and I'll get into that in detail. But so if you just peel the onion on F-35. Jim mentioned when he answered the sustainability question, if you look at the three elements, a nice pleasant surprise for us, which is a good news story is, there is a demand still for added capability, added technology on the airplane that we - and our partner companies are working on. So we still see development being a decent size, relatively speaking, decent-sized piece of the portfolio. It's going to be cost plus, so dilutive, but we'll take it, which then takes us to production, which is still going to be the lion's share of that piece of the portfolio. And I've said this before, if we perform on our current contracts as we believe we should be able to, and we're able to get acceptable deals on our future LRIPs, there should be some margin opportunity there. The only thing I'd caution is, we're looking at our performance on Lot 12 through 14 now. And whether we do a risk retirement later this year, we want to see some more improvement there before we do that. So I think the point I just made is valid that the opportunity is there. We have to perform, and we're just keeping a close eye on that. And then sustainment is going to be the fastest-growing piece of this - part of the portfolio, and it will continue to grow. I mean, we're going to continue to stand up bases. We're going to continue need sparing. We will back on the follow-on modernization work we're doing in development. We'll have to retrofit some of those aircraft that are already in the field. But today, they're cost plus and our customers buying on an annual basis, which is the argument Jim made, is inefficient. There's going to have to be - we believe there's a better way to procure, and that's why we offered that performance-based logistics concept and we'll see where that goes, if that morphs into something. And if industry is prepared as we are to take on the investment and take on the risk and sign up to a service-level agreement, and we perform, there should be some profit opportunities there. F-16, we've got 128 aircraft in backlog, five customers. We have - we see a lot of interest out there internationally from many, many countries. We're going to deliver eight aircraft next year. And we will, basically, by the middle of this decade, ramp up to about three, 3.5 airplane deliveries per month. There should be - and they're all FMS contracts. That's the way the customer is procuring them today. There should be some margin opportunity there for us. And then the last piece of Aeronautics is our Skunk Works. And it is our fastest-growing piece of Aeronautics, likely will be in the foreseeable future. But a lot of those contracts are classified. A lot of them are cost plus. Again, maybe margin erosion, but I'll take the top line growth with the added profit any day. So that's Aeronautics. Missiles and Fire Control, I think we have the opportunity to keep the margins where they are today. We do have a little bit of a mix issue. We should continue to see strong demand for PAC-3s into the foreseeable future. We're continuing to build out real estate to continue with the needed demand out there. And then the other piece that is going to continue to be quite large and continue to grow is in the classified area, which today is cost plus, will be in the foreseeable future, which will have a dilutive effect on margins, but we'll take that any day. And ultimately, that should morph into production and fixed price and allow us to grow margins there. At RMS, I think it's probably best to talk about Sikorsky. We're starting to see the CH-53K go into production. Jim in his prepared comments talked about some of the international opportunities, specifically Israel we have there, which will be a great opportunity for us. A lot of these other helicopter programs are now into production. And then ultimately, we'll have to down-select on FLRAA and FARA and we're bullish on those. And by the end of this decade, it will start - they'll start out as development programs. By the end of this decade, they'll be in production as well and hopefully see some margin improvements there. And then lastly, Space. Space, if it wasn't for AWE, they would be our fastest-growing business area this year at 7%. And we should see, with our core space business, we should continue to see growth there. It will be a mix between cost plus and fixed price. United Launch Alliance is alive and well, and will continue to be, and will give us a nice equity earnings stream. But I see some - based on where we are today, I see some margin upside there as well based on where they are today. Okay. Hey, Rich, it's Ken. Hopefully, this will resonate with you, but I think it's a consistent story. First and foremost, we're going to generate as much cash as we can, and that was one of the rationales of why we decided to start deferring our ERISA funding in 2021 from an economic standpoint. That made the most sense. But first and foremost, we're going to invest in our business, whether that's organic or inorganically. We have still some decent-sized capital outlays this year of, rough numbers, about $1.8 billion. We're at record levels of IRAD spend this year, and we'll continue to do that. And we'll - this - again, we'll focus on organic. And then inorganically, in Jim's prepared statements, we talked about Aerojet Rocketdyne. That's on-track. We just got our second request from the FTC, which is no surprise. Nothing has changed. We're still very bullish about that for that to come to resolution in the fourth quarter of this year. And then it comes down to the excess cash, what do we do with it? We are focused on our dividend strategy. That would be the next in the batting order. We're going to - in the third quarter, Jim and I will go see the Board with our Treasurer, John Mallard, to make a recommendation on what's the appropriate increase in our dividends, and it should be deemed favorable to our shareholders. And then lastly, it's share buybacks. And frankly, Rich, what we saw in the first quarter where our stock was trading, we thought it was grossly undervalued, and we went into this accelerated share buyback plan and deemed to be very successful. And we will opportunistically, in the next three quarters, buy back stock where it makes sense. And think of that as anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion in the next three months. We have the balance sheet to do everything I just described, and we'll continue evaluating that. And I'll hand it over to Jim to talk about if there's any other investments in - I think you mentioned ABL and other type opportunities out there. Hey, Kristine, it's Ken. We really didn't make an investment in ABL. What we basically agreed to is to commit to a range of launch vehicles. And think of this for lower-level satellites that don't require the horsepower of, say, our United Launch Alliance. The only investment we do have is it's in our Ventures group. And think of that as this is more for the technology that they bring to make our products better. And it's a relatively modest - that's a relatively modest investment. So I'm not sure I would look at it as something that from an acquisition standpoint. And the question you asked for when do we look at getting out of those type investments? So we did - as you heard, we did have some investments that actually went public, that allowed us to make a gain. Some of those are back, which we're going to be required to hold, and then we'll make a determination whether it makes sense for Lockheed Martin to get out of those ventures, but then to continue to utilize that technology. And just as an example, ABL, we would do something very similar. And again, I'm not suggesting that whether they're public or not. We would just make a determination when it makes sense for that modest investment in them, that we have whether it makes sense for us to get out or not and just continue to utilize their technologies. Sure. I'll take that, Ron. Good morning. I think a little bit goes back to what George was asking me in terms of the first quarter versus the rest of it. So I would say on production, we're down - it's - I'm going to call it flat, Ron, just because it's down year-over-year, $25 million. But what we're basically looking at on development on the whole - and this goes back to the earlier conversation. This in some ways is for Lockheed Martin is a good problem to have, we continue to have that demand out there for increasing technology, but I don't see development growing. So let's, for year-over-year, call it, flat production. just based on - if you think about production revenues, it's really not for the most part, it's really not for the deliveries we're making this year, which are Lot 12 and Lot 13. It's really for the deliveries we're making next year. We're building those aircraft out now for next year. And then we're doing the buy ahead, if you will, for the following year. That's generally where the sales are coming for this year. And we're fairly confident - we're very confident, I should say, in the stream and the flow of what's going on. So think of production is going to grow this year low single digits. And I've been relaying that sales are going to continue to grow at a relatively slow pace for production. The growth is in sustainment. And in the quarter, we did see growth in sustainment, and we will see growth for the year in the - close to the almost 10% range. So I don't think that's a concern. I think F-22 - I'm not sure you called that the linchpin or the bedrock of the business area. I'd say, Ron, relatively speaking, F-16 is almost double the size of F-22. I think that's more of the parameter of where the rest of aeronautics is going, including the Skunk Works. I would say F-22 is going to continue to be flat and declining as well C-130, and the pleasant surprise on C-130 is it's not declining as quickly as we thought it was. The team has done a nice job of getting congressional adds from the United States government and international customers for that great workhorse. And that's going to be flat over time. So I'd say your big drivers going forward for growth at Aeronautics will be sustainment on F-35, F-16 and then the Skunk Works and then the bedrock, if you will, will be the modest growth that we're going to have going forward on production."

Hope you've all had a good start to the new year, and I thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call as we review our results, key business area accomplishments and our outlook for 2023. I'd like to begin with a few highlights from the quarter and from the year, and then Jay will review the financials in a more detailed manner. Lockheed Martin had a strong close to 2022. All of our business areas met or exceeded our prior expectations, resulting in a 2022 full year sales of $66 billion, segment operating profit of $7.2 billion and earnings per share of $21.66. Our free cash flow for the year of $6.1 billion also came in above our prior expectation, while backlog for the year increased to $150 billion, driven by all-time record orders for Lockheed Martin. Our financial results included more than $1.7 billion of independent research and development investments, or IRAD, a new high watermark for the company. We also continue to modernize and streamline our operations to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. Significant capital projects include our ongoing investment in what we call One Lockheed Martin transformation or 1LMX. This is our multiyear internal project to transform our business processes and systems from end-to-end. By implementing new digital tools in our operations and expanding our use of model-based engineering to enhance our speed to market and our cost competitiveness. In 2022, we completed a majority of the detail design for our new systems and business processes. And for 2023, we expect to complete the detailed design and implementation road maps that go with it, and then we'll transition to the system build and configuration phase over the next couple of years. These IRAD and capital investments accelerate the capabilities our customers need and for our operations to efficiently and effectively meet those needs. From a capital return perspective, we delivered approximately $11 billion to shareholders in 2022 via share repurchases of $7.9 billion and dividends of $3 billion. During the fourth quarter specifically, we entered into a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase program, and we've retired approximately 7 million shares under that agreement so far.  We expect to complete our remaining repurchase authorization of $10 billion over the next few years, consistent with our focus to deliver free cash flow per share growth to you, the investor. These operational and financial results created significant value for our shareholders, ending the year with a total shareholder return of 40%. I will touch briefly now on the Department of Defense, or DoD, budget. In late December, Congress signed the FY '23 Omnibus spending bill into law, appropriating $858 billion for National Defense, including $817 billion for the DoD-based budget. This reflects approximately 10% growth year-over-year for both national defense and the DoD-based budget. The law also represents a 6%, or $45 billion increase from the President's budget request for DoD. These appropriations enabled us, along with the Joint Program Office, to finalize the contract for the production and delivery of up to 398 F-35s for $30 billion in Lots 15 and 16, including the option for Lot 17. Further, several other of Lockheed Martin\u2019s programs received the funding levels necessary to drive the growth outlook we previously identified, including our combat rescue helicopter, the C-130J, Blackhawk, CH-53K and FAAD. We view this funding outcome as positive for the future, and our current expectation is that growth will materialize over the longer term, starting in 2024. Let's now turn to the four growth pillars: programs of record, hypersonics, classified activities and new awards. With regard to programs of record, there were several important developments in key signature programs in our fourth quarter. On the F-35, the definitization of Lots 15 through 17, as I mentioned a minute ago, included the first F-35 aircraft to be produced for Belgium, Finland and Poland. We received authorization to procure long lead items for Lot 18 F-35 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and U.S. allies as well. We also formally welcomed Germany, the ninth foreign military sales country, to the F-35 Lightning II program. And earlier in January, Canada officially became an F-35 operator as the country selected the aircraft to replace its aging fighter fleet. We continue to expect deliveries of the F-35 to ramp to 156 by 2025. Despite the temporary pause in flight operations and corresponding suspension of engine deliveries that began in December and resulted in the delivery of just 141 F-35s in 2022, seven shy of our expectation of 148 before the engine issue was discovered. Also in the quarter, the U.S. Navy authorized the CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter to enter full rate production and then its deployment phase. This important milestone allows the program to proceed beyond low-rate initial production. And this achievement attests to our long-standing partnership with the U.S. Marine Corps and instills confidence and stability in Sikorsky's diverse domestic supply chain. In addition, at Sikorsky, international demand for the Black Hawk remains strong. Last week, the Australian Army announced it will acquire 40 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters to replace its current multi-role helicopter fleet. Deliveries are expected to begin for Australia this year. Further, the Lockheed Martin built Orion exploration class spacecraft launched on NASA's ARTEMIS 1 and completed a 25-day flight test, slashing down off the coast of California. This successful mission takes us one step closer to the first woman and first person of color setting foot on the moon. On its journey, Orion traveled more than 1.4 million miles through deep space and surpassed records for total distance. It traveled 270,000 miles from home and the farthest distance from earth by a spacecraft designed to carry humans. We look forward to the next stages of the program with seven additional missions under contract. Turning to hypersonics. In December, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control and the U.S. Air Force successfully conducted a hypersonic-boosted flight test of the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon. This was the first launch of a full prototype operational missile, meeting all its objectives for the test, including reaching speeds of greater than 5 times the speed of sound. With regard to classified programs, we achieved successful milestones across multiple business areas in 2022 and grew 5% year-over-year. We continue to expect growth in classified that will outpace the rest of the portfolio over the next several years. And finally, at new awards, Lockheed Martin's Next-Generation Interceptor, or NGI, continues to make progress. In late October, we announced the delivery of the first NGI flight software package to the Missile Defense Agency, providing the framework of software development tools, process workflows, scripts and environments. The delivery was ahead of schedule and is a critical step on the path for flight testing and fielding. This program remains a focused competition for Lockheed Martin with the first NGI forecast for delivery in 2027. With regard to the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft, or FLRAA, competition, we were disappointed in the U.S. Army's decision. And upon review, we determined a formal protest by Sikorsky on behalf of Team Defiant to be the best course of action. We continue to believe that Defiant X with its increased speed, range, manoeuvrability and survivability is the transformational and most cost-effective aircraft that best meets the selection criteria for this competition. Sikorsky remains one of two competitors for the other component of the Future Vertical Lift initiative that's called the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, or FARA, which is currently expected to be awarded in 2025. The first RatorX-competitive prototype is over 90% complete and has more than 65% of its acceptance testers already done. Sikorsky is the only company with a representative FARA technology demonstrator aircraft. I saw it fly down at West Palm Beach a few months ago. It's amazing, the S97 RAIDER, which has completed more than 110 flight hours. In November, Norway became the first international customer for our new TPY-4 radar. It's the first software-defined radar that outperforms in target detection, mission diversity and transportability. Norway is going to receive eight of Lockheed Martin's TPY-4 radar with options for three additional radar. Finally, backlog ended 2022 at $150 billion with book-to-bill of 1.2 times and increases in every business area across Lockheed Martin. This strong demand signal bodes well for future growth over the longer term for our company. So, these four pillars will guide us as we face a challenging geopolitical environment and apply growth and integrated capabilities mindset to everything we do here. As conflict continues in Ukraine, unfortunately, and projected global threats require coordinated efforts to protect the U.S. and our allied territories, ongoing progress in our 21st Century Security vision will enable the acceleration of advanced capabilities to defer these threats and drive effective Joint All Domain Operations for our military service customers. In the fourth quarter, we continued to announce and expand strategic agreements with America's leading commercial digital companies, such as IBM's Red Hat, to advance artificial intelligence innovation on Lockheed Martin military platforms; and for Microsoft, with whom we're going to help power classified cloud advanced technologies for the Department of Defense. Microsoft's latest secure framework will make Lockheed Martin the first non-government entity to independently operate inside the Microsoft Azure Government Secret Cloud, ushering in a new era of cloud opportunities for the industry. As we look ahead, demand for Lockheed Martin platforms and systems is strong in the United States and abroad. We continue to expect 2023 sales about the same level as we discussed back in October. We also continue to expect a return to sustained top line growth in 2024 and beyond as headwinds diminish in our program mix, the supply chain continues to recover and our signature programs grow. Free cash flow per share will remain a key focus as we maximize returns for you, our shareholders. 2022 is a year of great accomplishments for our company in the face of a lot of dynamic challenges. The outstanding achievements of our teams resulted from real deep commitments across our business areas and better cooperation among them as well as our corporate functions to develop, produce and deliver world-class systems to our country and its allies. Our progress this year is a testament to the dedication of our 116,000 team members and the values we all share. So with that, let me hand it off to Jay to give more color on the financials, and we'll join you later to answer your questions. Jay?\nJay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results for 2022, additional business area detail and offer a first full look at 2023 guidance. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart three, an overview of our consolidated 2022 financials. Lockheed Martin followed up a solid third quarter with a strong finish to 2022, highlighted by 7% year-over-year sales growth in the fourth quarter and effectively managed a turbulent year impacted by COVID and supply chain disruptions as well as inflation levels not seen in decades. Besides sales, we also exceeded our expectations for segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow, all while absorbing incremental headwinds tied to restructuring activities within RMS and mark-to-market losses in our investment portfolios. We also booked record orders in 2022, resulting in 11% growth to an ending backlog of $150 billion. In addition to our orders on F-35, we experienced a surge in new interest for our industry-leading security solutions, such as in classified programs in Space and in Missiles and Fire Control, where we booked approximately $1.5 billion in orders, reflecting increased demand to replenish U.S. stocks and enhance security positions globally. And we delivered on our commitment to boost shareholder returns by deploying nearly $11 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends while making significant investments in our businesses. Taken together, these results demonstrate the perseverance of our dedicated employees to perform in challenging environments and support our expectations for 2023 and beyond. Taking a closer look at full year results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit on Chart four. Sales came in higher than expected by nearly $750 million, limiting the decline to 2% year-over-year and essentially recovering to the sales guidance we had originally communicated last January. The stronger-than-expected performance was broad-based across all four business areas and reflects strong coordination with supplier partners to drive material throughput and program schedule performance as well as some favourable award timing, which drove additional revenue. Segment operating profit declined 2% year-over-year but also finished higher than expected by almost $50 million driven by the higher sales. Operating margins settled at 10.9%, slightly lower year-over-year and versus expectations based on lower net favourable profit adjustments. Moving to earnings per share on Chart five. Adjusted earnings per share grew 2% for the year as the benefit from share repurchases overcame headwinds from lower segment profit and FAS/CAS pension income. Moving to cash flow on Chart six. We delivered $6.1 billion of free cash flow for the year while investing almost $1.7 billion in CapEx at a ratio of 1.4 times depreciation. We also ended the year with nearly $1.5 billion of accelerated payments to our suppliers, maintaining our commitment to a resilient supply chain. As I noted earlier, 2022 represented a significant year of cash deployment. In total, we returned 178% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2022, leveraging our performance and strong balance sheet while still investing for our anticipated growth trajectory in 2024 and beyond. Okay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart seven. Full year sales grew 1% year-over-year primarily driven by increases in our classified programs, partially offset by lower F-35 production volume. Operating profit increased 2% driven by higher net favourable profit adjustments more than offsetting the impact of the lower volume. For the year, backlog at Aeronautics grew 15%. As mentioned, Aeronautics completed the F-35 Lot 15 through 17 negotiations and secured production volumes while providing the services with a value proposition that combines the highest performance at affordable cost. Looking at Missiles and Fire Control on Page eight. Sales decreased 3% driven primarily by lower volume on our special ops sustainment program following the Afghan withdrawal, along with lower volume on sensors programs. Segment operating profit was down 1% with lower favourable profit adjustments primarily on PAC-3. For the year, backlog increased 6% on the back of tactical missile strength. At Rotary and Mission Systems on Page nine, sales decreased year-over-year by 4% driven primarily by a non-recurring revenue event in our training business in 2021 along with lower C6ISR and Black Hawk volume at Sikorsky. Operating profit decreased 7%, following Sikorsky and C6ISR volume and lower favourable profit adjustments on the Black Hawk program. Backlog grew 4% in 2022, led by the Defense of Guam award, where RMS will be the lead integrator of the multi-domain air and missile defense system as well as stronger Sikorsky orders. Turning to Chart 10 in our Space business area. Sales decreased 2% due to the 2021 renationalization of the AWE program, partially offset by growth on a Next-Generation Interceptor program and national security space. Operating profit decreased 8% with lower net profit adjustments, partially offset by higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Backlog grew 16% based on strong classified program captures and Orion orders. So all told, a strong finish to the year. So let's now shift to 2023 on Page 11. Before introducing our expectations, I'd like to inform you of a reporting change in segment operating profit starting in 2023. We will report purchased intangible asset amortization expense in unallocated corporate expense below segment operating profit. Previously, intangible amortization was included in segment operating profit. This change will not impact total earnings, and we believe the change provides a more accurate view of operating performance for each of our four business areas. The impact is approximately 40 basis points on our 2023 expectations, consistent with the impact in previous years.  Our 2023 financial outlook includes the impact of this change, and you can find supporting data for these adjustments in the appendices of our web charts as well as in the earnings release.  Okay, let's get into the outlook for 2023. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $65 billion to $66 billion and the midpoint is slightly below 2022. Speaking to the timing of sales this year, we expect the first quarter to be our lowest quarter of the year, ramping up quarter-over-quarter as we did in 2022. Segment operating profit for 2023 normalized for intangible asset amortization has improved what we thought -- from what we thought in October. And we now estimate only 10 basis points of headwind from 2022 with segment operating margins at 11.1% under our new reporting. We currently expect $2.1 billion of FAS/CAS income in 2023. It's estimated to be roughly $100 million lower in '22, excluding the impact from our pension transfer transaction. Our earnings per share is expected to be between $26.60 and $26.90 for '23 with the year-over-year reduction to adjusted EPS primarily driven by lower segment operating profit in FAS/CAS income, partially offset by the benefit from a lower share count. Our free cash flow estimate for 2023 is greater to or equal than $6.2 billion and assumes continued enactment of the R&D tax capitalization.  This increase of $100 million to cash generation, along with our share repurchase guide of another $4 billion, highlights our continued focus on increasing free cash flow per share for our shareholders. This projected combination of higher free cash flow and a lower share count lead to a mid-single-digit growth expectation in free cash flow per share in 2023. Okay. On Chart 20 -- on Chart 12, let's sum it all up. We closed out 2022 with a strong finish with operating momentum and a robust backlog, which have us well positioned to resume growth in 2024 and beyond. We also placed a premium on leveraging our strong cash generation and balance sheet to increase cash returns to our shareholders with a significant increase to share repurchases. Across all four business areas, our breadth of development, production and sustainment programs continue to drive a foundation of growth and sustained high performance. And we will work actively with our customers to meet their increasing demands and mission requirements looking ahead to the future. Our investments for growth, value and efficiency are aligned with our strategy for technology advancement and improved synergies across Lockheed Martin. So in closing, we believe the business is well positioned for long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders.  With that, John, let's open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And first go the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead. \nDavid Strauss: Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Jim, I wanted to ask you about, you highlighted the headwinds that you have in terms of your program mix in '23 is the reason for flattish sales. Could you quantify what that number is in terms of the headwind and what programs specifically you're looking at? And then as a quick follow-up, the FY '23 budget came in, I think, a fair amount better than you were anticipating plus ops on F-35 and C-130. How might that change what you've previously said with regard to the reacceleration in growth in 2024? Is it better than low single digit now? Thanks. \nJay Malave: So David, let me take the first one and then kick over the second part of your question to Jim and just really talk in the context of '23 and what's going to be different in 2024. In 2023, when you look at it, we've got continued growth in our four pillars, really the programs of record that Jim had mentioned. But we do have some specific unique items to 2023, and I'll give you an example. For example, in aero. On the F-35, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in sustainment on the program. But we are expecting also a mid-single-digit decline in production as deliveries catch up to the material that we had purchased in prior years. Similarly, on the F-16, we're going to see continued growth in production to roll out our backlog, but we are seeing a reduction in modernization and sustainment programs on the F-16. So as those -- both of those normalize in 2023 going into 2024, they will no longer be headwinds, which will continue to allow for growth in Aeronautics, particularly in the F-35 sustainment and on F-16 production. Similarly, like MFC, what we saw in 2022 and it carries over a little bit to 2023 is some of the areas where we see the higher demand from a production level, particularly in programs of record, things like PAC-3, it's taken us a little bit longer than we originally expected to ramp up. And so we're going to see gradual improvement in supply chain as well as our internal operations in '23 with stronger growth in 2024. At RMS, CH-53 will double deliveries in '24 versus '23. And '23 versus '22 is pretty much flat deliveries. We also see probably some Black Hawk growth in '24 as well. And what we're going through right now is the transition for multiyear 9 to multiyear 10 in RMS and Sikorsky specifically. So those are all things that we think will lift from '24 relative to '23, and those are headwinds that are really unique to 2023.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. And as far as where the defense budget came out, David, it really aligns with our view in our company about the nature of the geopolitical threat, the need to modernize U.S. and allied forces to continue to hopefully deter armed conflict beyond the sad and unfortunate situation in the Ukraine that's already happened and the fact that there's bipartisan support in Congress to do just that. So we've been expecting all along in our kind of long-range plan that the U.S. government and Congress would step up to meet the reality of the global geopolitical situation. And that's exactly what played out in the budget process for FY '23. We also expect that same reality to continue to sadly exist again in the next budget cycle, which is happening even now in -- for 2024. So we don't see the circumstances the fundamentals changing. Therefore, we also believe that the continued robustness of the defense budget is going to be a reality as well.\nJay Malave: Just let me follow up on your last question, David, whether or not there's upside. Where we see potential increases to where we were at baseline before really is in MFC. Over the next five years, we've got revenue potential. It's around $6 billion. And that would more than offset lost revenue associated with FLRAA should that decision hold. And so net-net, we see that there could be some upside over the next five years.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Myles Walton with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. \nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. Jim, maybe one quick one and one sort of allow you to expand a little bit. When is your expected restart of deliveries in the F-35, as a quick one? And then, obviously, there's more of a debate going on in D.C. around fiscal restraint and has been in place in the last several years. And so I'm just curious where you think this ends up as one thing, but more importantly, what, if anything, do you do operationally to prepare yourself for whatever the outcomes are in terms of balance sheet holding back on repo or leaning forward, looking for areas where 2023 budget -- excuse me, 2024 budget might be in a continuing resolution for a full year. Anything on that perspective from an operational perspective?\nJim Taiclet: Sure, Myles. So as far as timing and resumption of deliveries on F-35, I think it's really important to differentiate between delivery and production, right? So we are continuing production in the final assembly factories at Fort Worth and Italy and in Japan at the same pace we expected to before the mishap occurred. We're also continuing to order and receive parts and materials from our supply chain as well. And so once an aircraft rolls out of the factory, our pilots and the DoD pilots conduct a handful of acceptance flights. That's what's kind of on hold right now is just that portion of the process. So the vast majority of our revenue, much greater than 90% is earned when the aircraft rolls out from the plant door. So Jay can add more color on the financial perspective, if you like, a little bit later, but that's really what happens. And so as far as the timing of resumption of deliveries, we'll be notified of that when the U.S. government and the propulsion supplier conclude their ongoing mishap investigation. Jay, do you want to add anything to that?\nJay Malave: No. You got it. That's it.\nJim Taiclet: Okay. And then secondly, we really can't predict the political dynamic in Congress and -- within and with the administration. So we're going to keep our head down, stay on our plan, do our job and expect that the right thing will occur at the other end of the 2024 budget process, which is fully funding and making available that funding to the department of defense, so we can deter conflict with them and that they can acquire what they need to do that. So that's our expectation. It's really difficult for us to lay out what we think the budget process will be given the nature of the House, Senate and the administration right now. But we expect that they are going to come together and do what's needed to defend the country and get the budget done.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nNoah Poponak: Hi, good morning. Jay, we've talked about this dynamic where the outlays are trailing the authorization and the possibility that supply chain is intertwined in that. And that was kind of tough in the first half of the year, look to be getting better in the third quarter, but then exited the year declining. Do you have any insight into incremental insight into what's going on there when that gets better? And to the extent that supply chain is related, your comments that you expect that to improve through '23, is that underway? You already see that happening? Or is that still just a logical anticipation of timing?\nJay Malave: Sure. Good question. Let me follow up. And we looked at this and tried to triangulate performance in a number of different ways. We looked at just straight piece part on-time delivery here in the fourth quarter relative to what we saw in the second and the third. We also looked at program performance, so earn value-type metrics, and we really didn't see a meaningful change in on-time delivery or schedule performance relative to our earned value systems. But what I will say is the fourth quarter had a significant step-up in requirements. And if you adjust for the number of weeks in the fourth quarter relative to the balance of the year and you also adjust for some of these benefits that we saw in terms of award timing, our requirements in the fourth quarter stepped up sequentially by about 5%. And I would say the entire value chain, whether it's our internal operations and the supply chain, was able to meet that increased level of requirements. So that, to me, bodes well to the future as well as expecting a gradual improvement in 2023. And I think that just provides a reasonable assumption and a reasonable basis for that assumption\nOperator: And we'll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead. \nGeorge Shapiro: Yes, good morning. If you look at the F-35 program, like the incremental profit you reported was about a 16.4% rate, so I assume you stepped up the margin on the F-35. And going forward then, the slight decline that you're forecasting in the margin probably reflects sustainment growing versus production. And a quick follow-up, the $20 million charge that you took in a classified program in aero, was that the same program that you took large charges a couple of years ago? Thanks.\nJay Malave: Okay. So George, I can probably answer your questions with one yes, but maybe I'll provide a little bit of color there. I now take the -- you're correct, on the charge we took, that was related to the program. We continue to have some learnings there. But our team, I think, in Skunk Works is doing a great job managing that program. And this is a development program where you see and you continue to have learnings. But in the grand scheme of things, I think we've managed that quite well. And it really hasn't -- did not impact our results. And as far as the F-35 program, we did see some benefits there. And you're right, in the quarter, we were -- the results there were augmented not only by the volume but as well as the net profit adjustments at Aeronautics, and it was across the board. I think next year, as we think about the margin, yes, there's a little bit of a headwind there. I think mix does play a part in it as well as right now, we're planning a little bit lower favourable profit adjustments. But for the year, in the grand scheme of Lockheed Martin, this year, we did about 25% of profit in net profit adjustments, and we would expect that to be somewhat similar for the entire company for '23. Thanks for the question, George.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead. \nRobert Spingarn: Good morning. Jim, I think everyone would agree that Lockheed's got the pole position in offensive hypersonics. Strong program portfolio there and some recent successes. What I think people might be interested in are your efforts as well in counter hypersonics as we might expect that to be a growing portion of the budget. Can you talk about that a little bit?\nJim Taiclet: Sure. And it's largely classified, Rob. But what I can say is many of the elements of counter hypersonics, we also have a pole position in, right? So we've got existing products that we can take the lessons learned from and a lot of the engineering and apply them to just a faster incoming target, right? So we're working on NGI, as you already heard, which is a ballistic missile. It travels at similar speeds. We have the FAAD system, which is a sort of a high-altitude interceptor as well. And then we have PAC-3, which is a very accurate lower-level further in, if you will, defensive systems. So we've got the engineering talent. We've got the intellectual property. And we're developing these 21st Century Security concepts like applying artificial intelligence to network systems together and process data much more quickly, which, of course, you need that to process the information coming in on a Mach 5 missile, right? So I think we have a lot of the elements that will go into the eventual counter hypersonic solutions, and we are working on many of them right now in integrating what we have and developing what we need.\nOperator: Our next question is from Richard Safran with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead. \nRichard Safran: Jim, Jay, Maria, good morning. How are you? \nJim Taiclet: Good morning. Well. Thanks. \nRichard Safran: So I wanted to ask you about the F-16 and maybe expand on the remarks you made just a few moments ago. I thought you might comment on things like U.S. and international opportunity set ahead, maybe update on the first delivery expected production rates. And if it's at all possible, maybe touch on like what margins you're expecting on the program right now. I'm just thinking that they should be pretty decent given the move to Greenville was done to improve the cost structure on the program.\nJim Taiclet: Rich, it's Jim. I'll start off quickly and hand it over to Jay for some of the background and data associated with the program. But the really great news is Block 70, which is the production article out of Greenville. The first Greenville Block 70 test flight was this morning was successful, really great milestone for the company and for that organization in South Carolina. But there's significant demand for this aircraft. A lot of coming organically, I guess, I'll call it, from allies around the world. Also, we're out actively marketing this jet to those countries that may not be authorized yet or maybe not have the infrastructure for F-35 at this moment but may in the future. India is one of those. I co-chair the U.S.-India CEO Forum with Secretary Raimondo. We're going to be going over there in a month or so with a team of CEOs from across our industry and meet with theirs and try to get collaboration going. And one of the, I would say, primary opportunities in that endeavour is the F-21, which is F-16 variant specifically designed for India, for example. So we haven't made that sale yet, but I can tell you all the way up to my level, we are out marketing F-16, and we have a lot of organic demand coming in from either existing, order customers or new ones. Jay, anything you want to add?\nJay Malave: Sure. Just maybe a little bit more color. Just on top of the first flight that we had today the successful first flight, congratulations to our Aeronautics team there. We have over 20 aircraft that are currently in process in the production phase. We will deliver anywhere between, say, 78 aircraft this year, and then that will step up significantly in 2024. And so we're on a good path that we recognize the opportunities that are in front of us. There are a few countries that have been announced there that we're eagerly awaiting contract finalization, hopefully this year, with Jordan and Bulgaria. That's about combined about 20 aircraft. And so the demand, as Jim mentioned, is pretty significant. And we're ramping up as we speak to be able to deliver the customer requirements.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much. Good morning, everyone. Jay, I'm sorry to waste a question on pension. But if we look at the CAS recoveries, it was about 30% of this year's cash flow. And I know there's discount rates and returns and all that stuff, but CAS tends to be much more visible than FAS on the income statement. So can you give us a multiyear outlook for the CAS recoveries over the next few years and where the balance stood at year-end?\nJay Malave: Yes. I mean -- so for cash this year, as we mentioned, that will decline this year. I said about $100 million. Specifically, the CAS element will decline by about -- the recoveries by about $75 million. We'll see that decline a little bit more over the next few years as well. And so it will come down in the range, I think, around $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion over the next few years. And so that's the best outlook we have today. As you know, these things are -- they do fluctuate and a little volatile. So we'll update that accordingly as we go and think about next year and what that means for 2025, Seth.\nOperator: And next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead. \nPeter Arment: Yes, thanks. Good morning, Jim, Jay. Jay, I wanted to just focus on Missiles and Fire Control. Just kind of obviously a little transition in growth this year, but profitability going to be down also looks like close to 90 basis points. Just maybe walk us through a little bit kind of some of the puts and takes there and just thoughts about kind of margin recovery as we think about the next couple of years where we've got all this growth inflected? Thanks.\nJay Malave: Yes. No, good question. This is something we talked a little bit on the third quarter call. We've got some new program awards, particularly in classified, that are going to put margin pressure not just next year but a few years beyond that as well. And it's really just on the early phase of these programs as we head into production. It's just low margin, and it will take time to have those restore to margins that we've seen in the past. What I will say is that we do have the benefit of some offsetting mix with the upside that we're seeing in this business. I mentioned before a potential $6 billion over the next five years. Those will come with more solid margins will help mitigate the reduction that we're seeing on these new programs. But there will be some pressure there that we have to deal with. And look, the MFC team has a good track record of driving out cost, driving margins. I'm confident they'll be able to do that in the future as well, but it will take a few years to get there.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. \nKristine Liwag: Good morning, everyone. Maybe switching gears to a different topic. With tighter cost of capital, we've seen valuations come down in high-growth investments. Is this a better time for corporate VC to enter into deals on attractive terms? I mean just looking at the limitations on M&As from the FTC stance that we saw with Aerojet Rocketdyne, I mean how should we think about the importance of Lockheed Martin Ventures to access these new technologies? And could we see ventures double from here?\nJim Taiclet: Kristine, this is Jim. One of the first things I did when I came from the Board to active management was to double, as you said, to double the venture fund, right? So, it was $200 million, now it's $400 million. We're actively -- actually, very actively looking to invest that additional funding. In the great scheme of the company, though, it's really designed to discover emerging technology that might be applicable to our strategy and to our products and systems and help kind of develop that technology in a way that it can have utilization earlier than perhaps otherwise for our industry. So, we get the most benefit out of our venture fund in actual operations, production and development of platforms and systems. We have had a nice upturn in the valuations of those investments as well, but they're not necessarily driving the ultimate results or the ultimate growth prospect of the company, but they're indirectly doing just that.\nJay Malave: I'll just add, Kristine, I mean it's a great point. I mean we've got a pretty tight alignment on the targets that we pursue to our technology road maps. And these are examples like Joint All Domain Operations interoperability, autonomy, artificial intelligence and other areas that will help us drive and accelerate our internal organic capability with these new emerging technologies. And so it's a great point. There's certainly opportunity there. As Jim mentioned, we've increased our availability of funding for that, and we're excited about those opportunities.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Scott Deuschle with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. \nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning. Jay, you guys have taken a bit of a different approach on this R&D tax issue than some of your peers. And I know this subject has been beaten to death already, but I'm just curious if you've had any recent conversations with the government on whether they're going to agree with the approach you've taken. And then I guess just stepping back more broadly, you had this uncertain tax position disclosed in the 10-Q. Just kind of give us a sense for when you think that might get resolved? Thank you so much.\nJay Malave: Sure. Good question. We remain confident in the position that we've taken. We've had really no dialogue. We are awaiting guidance from the IRS on what contracts specifically would be covered. You're right that different players have taken different positions. We remain confident in our position. We believe that the risk is a factor. And when you are under particularly cost-type contracts, there is no risk taken by the provider of those services. Secondly, we believe the benefit is marginal because the owner or the contractor of that work is really the one that takes over that technology and can transfer it to others at any point in time. And so we think that those are sound base and sound arguments supported by legal teams that we have in a position that we've taken. But again, it's uncertain -- and our uncertain tax position really reflects that uncertainty. So, I can't give you specific one way or the other in terms of IRS positions because we just don't know as of yet. But I can tell you, we spent a lot of time researching this, a lot of time discussing it, deliberating it internally, and we think the position that we've come out is the right position.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. \nRobert Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. Jay, a boring inflation question for you. Are you seeing any signs that inflation is starting to ease as it works itself through your system? Or was there any mitigation for this cost inflation that is going to be flowing through from the final FY '23 budget resolution?\nJay Malave: Yes. Rob, inflation is something that we evaluate all the time. In many of our existing contracts, we have not really seen a significant impact, only because I mean our fixed price contracts -- our suppliers are under fixed price contracts with us. Where we have seen is really on new proposals is where we've seen some impacts, where you've got suppliers unwilling to provide longer-term price commitments requesting what we refer to in the industry as economic price adjustments, which are escalation clauses, inflation clauses. And those are ongoing dialogues that we have with our customers as well. And so it's still an ongoing issue. To be honest with you, on the proposal side, we really haven't seen any type of reduction there in the pressure. It's something that we review quite often on these new proposals, and it's something that we grapple with because either you have to price in some type of inflation assumption into your proposal or you have to have some type of back-to-back agreement where you're going to have an inflation clause. And we're getting squeezed with our customer as well as with our suppliers, and we're trying to make sure that we can accommodate both requirements here.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Herbert with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. \nKenHerbert: Hi, good morning, Jim and Jay. Just wanted to ask a question here on the new award outlook. Putting FARA aside, if you look at NGI, maybe NGAD and other opportunities, what's the current expectations for timing around some awards, specifically around NGI? And are there other programs out there on the new award side that could significantly move the needle as we think about sort of the potential impact into '24?\nJay Malave: You think about a few of these, it's something that we have -- I mean you know that the F-35, so we've got waiting for the -- we're expecting the production order on Lot 17 in 2023. We do have a large missile -- air and missile defense program -- international program. It's an important program for us this year. And so it's probably back half of the year type of decision. That is included in our four pillars of growth when we talk about new awards. There are other programs here that are classified, really can't get into kind of the detail of those, but we expect some of those awards to be made either at the tail end of this year or into next year as well. And in NGI, we would expect to down-select around 2025. And so there's a fair amount of markers out there in some of these programs that I just spoke between now, really in 2025, that certainly are important to us. Jim mentioned FARA. That's probably a 2025 decision as well.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead. \nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning. Thank you for the time, Jim and Jay. Jay, I think your margins came in a little bit better for 2023 than anticipated your guidance of about 10 bps higher. When we think about your profitability going forward, is this sort of the expected range we should expect? And of your segments, which do you think is the biggest variable? You talked about MFC and some of the challenges there. So maybe if you could talk about that.\nJay Malave: Yes. Let me maybe talk a bit in the kind of longer-term outlook. And you look at the history of Lockheed Martin over the last probably five to 10 years, and we've reached margins in the range of 12%. I do believe we have the potential to get back to those, but that will take time. In the short term, really, I would say, over the next three years or so, our objective will be just to hold the margins where they are because some of these pressures that we see on these new programs, particularly at MFC, when you've got a 90 basis point reduction in one year from -- in one BA, that's a lot to really overcome. We've worked things internally as far as both product cost reductions, overhead cost reductions to really try to drive and maintain our margin profile. But that's where we're really going to be over the next few years is really trying to maintain where we are as we re-crank the growth cycle. And I think that's the key message that we have had internally: let's re-crank the growth cycle, get ourselves in 2024 on track to deliver the growth. As we get that flywheel turning, then we'll be able to focus and turn back around on margins and start improving margins.\nOperator: Next question is from Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead. \nDougHarned: Good morning. Thank you. On F-35, so when you get ready to restart here, you've also though now flown the F-35 with tech refresh upgrade -- or Tech Refresh 3 upgrade. Can you talk about how that's progressing, how Tech Refresh 3 is progressing? And how does the progress there play into your delivery plans for Lots 15 through 17? And perhaps you might also comment on, when you get the restart, you've got these airplanes that have already been produced. Should we see those as really add-ons to 2023 deliveries?\nJim Taiclet: So Doug, let me take the first portion of your question, it's Jim, and then turn it over to Jay for the second piece on delivery numbers, et cetera. So Tech Refresh 3 is really important in a couple of dimensions. And you're accurate in mentioning and thank you for the first flight with the TR3 upgraded hardware and software was literally just a few weeks ago. We've got more software releases to go. We're going to add capability over the next couple of months. But we expect production of TR3-capable aircraft hopefully in this -- during the course of this year. That's our expectation. Now what that does for the customer and for us and our strategy is really kind of two major dimensions. One is for the capability of the aircraft itself. It will be able to handle more weapons. It will be able to upgrade electronic warfare capabilities. It will be able to accomplish more missions. So the basic functionality of the aircraft alone by itself is going to be elevated significantly by the insertion of this technology. And what is this technology? It's an updated core processor. So the -- basically the server for the airplane that it carries with it is going to the next-generation upgrade. The data storage is going to be vastly improved. And then the display is going to be modernized for the pilot, so what they see, how they interact with the jet and with other aircraft and systems around it. So those three things, right, data processing capability and speeds, data storage capacity, and the ability to interconnect with basically a modernized interface for the pilot along with the better capabilities they're going to have to interact with other aircraft to other systems because of TR3 are all of the characteristics that you need for an edge compute node in a modern 5G Internet of Things system and architecture, right? The three things are data storage, multi-cloud connection and processing power and speed. So we've actually killed two birds with one stone with TR3 here. On one hand, the aircraft is going to be much more capable in the kind of its traditional role. On the second hand, it's going to be way more capable, perhaps uniquely capable, in sort of the network Internet of Things or Joint All-Domain Operations of the future, right? That's what our customer calls that. So we have now the computing power and the capacity to serve as sort of the central aerial component of our 21st Century Security open architecture concept. And that's really the two pieces of F-35, TR3. They're super important. One is the airplane itself; and second, its ability to network with other systems and aircraft in an IoT-based architecture open architecture. Jay, do you want to speak to that?\nJay Malave: Sure. To answer the question on add-ons, that is -- will be -- that will occur but not necessarily in 2023. If you think about it right now, we're going to be introducing and cutting in new production, hardware and software on a full rate production program, which is a pretty aggressive schedule. And so what I would expect -- and this is included in our sustainment revenue growth projections, we'll see the retrofits on the existing fleet over time. And that will probably start beginning maybe sometime in 2024 and beyond, and its part of our mid-single-digit sustainment growth on the F-35.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nMatt Akers: Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask, I think you had mentioned some of the restocking of stuff Ukraine and you've got some orders there. How big is that for Lockheed Martin? And how should we think about sort of the timing? And how accretive that might be the growth maybe in '24 and beyond? \nJay Malave: Yes. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got about -- we had orders of about $1.5 billion. We'll start delivering on some of that in 2023, and that will carry over into 2024. We've got a line of sight to significantly more orders beyond that, that we'll see again in the outer years. And so it's still to be determined. But what I can say is that we have had contract funding and internally funded projects to make sure we can meet higher ramp rates, whether it's HIMARS, GMLRS, PAC-3, all of those, all are opportunities from where we are today and part of the investment that our customer is making and that we are making to drive the higher ramp rates.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. And Matt, it's Jim. One of the issues that this situation has illuminated with is that when you need to accelerate production in the defense enterprise for national defense, we would have liked to have been able to A, ramp up the production faster and B, bringing the revenue sooner. So it just highlights the need, I think, and it's an urgent one, to work together with government and industry to quickly evolve the relationship between the two so that we can maintain an effective deterrent conflict as we've talked about. So what I'm discussing with some of our senior government officials who are receptive, and there are several thought leaders in government on this now, is apply the concept of anti-fragility to the relationship between government and industry, meaning things like ensure that we have multiple reliable sources of key materials and components, right? So we have a lot of single-source components that we have to go back down into our supply chain and find out who and if they can double or triple their production of the components so we can double or triple the output of the system. Another piece of this anti-fragility concept is to have the government invest in production capacity with us, call it, 2 standard deviations above the mean peace time production rates. So if you need to accelerate, you can quickly and start up the line or speed up the line much faster. Another one is significant, expansion of the use of long-term and multiyear contracts so that we don't have to have a fluctuation in demand year-to-year, which sets our supply base back, again, less willing to invest because they can't predict the future. And then finally, especially for those small and medium businesses, we're suggesting that government really take an overview of a broad overview of the oversight and compliance burdens that are on companies that participate in the defense industrial base from an audit and compliance and certified cost perspective, truth and negotiation act, things like that, while we at Lockheed Martin and other major defense funds would like to see that burden ease, it's a burden that can really prohibit other medium and small companies from working with us or working with the government to provide what it needs. So there's a great dialogue beginning. I'm sure other companies are raising these issues too. But this issue of restocking raised an important industry issue that we're going to try to work with government to solve.\nMaria Ricciardone Lee: Great. John, this is Maria. I think we've come to the top of the hour here, so I'll turn it back to Jim for any last thoughts.\nJim Taiclet: Great. Thanks, Maria. I'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire Lockheed Martin community for everything they've done in 2022 and they'll do this year and beyond. Together, we positioned our company to continue to push the edge of the technology and advance scientific discovery to ensure our customers remain what we call ahead of ready and keep people safe around the globe. So thanks again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next call in April. John, that concludes the call. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Hope you've all had a good start to the new year, and I thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter 2022 earnings call as we review our results, key business area accomplishments and our outlook for 2023. I'd like to begin with a few highlights from the quarter and from the year, and then Jay will review the financials in a more detailed manner. Lockheed Martin had a strong close to 2022. All of our business areas met or exceeded our prior expectations, resulting in a 2022 full year sales of $66 billion, segment operating profit of $7.2 billion and earnings per share of $21.66. Our free cash flow for the year of $6.1 billion also came in above our prior expectation, while backlog for the year increased to $150 billion, driven by all-time record orders for Lockheed Martin. Our financial results included more than $1.7 billion of independent research and development investments, or IRAD, a new high watermark for the company. We also continue to modernize and streamline our operations to increase efficiencies and reduce costs. Significant capital projects include our ongoing investment in what we call One Lockheed Martin transformation or 1LMX. This is our multiyear internal project to transform our business processes and systems from end-to-end. By implementing new digital tools in our operations and expanding our use of model-based engineering to enhance our speed to market and our cost competitiveness. In 2022, we completed a majority of the detail design for our new systems and business processes. And for 2023, we expect to complete the detailed design and implementation road maps that go with it, and then we'll transition to the system build and configuration phase over the next couple of years. These IRAD and capital investments accelerate the capabilities our customers need and for our operations to efficiently and effectively meet those needs. From a capital return perspective, we delivered approximately $11 billion to shareholders in 2022 via share repurchases of $7.9 billion and dividends of $3 billion. During the fourth quarter specifically, we entered into a $4 billion accelerated share repurchase program, and we've retired approximately 7 million shares under that agreement so far.  We expect to complete our remaining repurchase authorization of $10 billion over the next few years, consistent with our focus to deliver free cash flow per share growth to you, the investor. These operational and financial results created significant value for our shareholders, ending the year with a total shareholder return of 40%. I will touch briefly now on the Department of Defense, or DoD, budget. In late December, Congress signed the FY '23 Omnibus spending bill into law, appropriating $858 billion for National Defense, including $817 billion for the DoD-based budget. This reflects approximately 10% growth year-over-year for both national defense and the DoD-based budget. The law also represents a 6%, or $45 billion increase from the President's budget request for DoD. These appropriations enabled us, along with the Joint Program Office, to finalize the contract for the production and delivery of up to 398 F-35s for $30 billion in Lots 15 and 16, including the option for Lot 17. Further, several other of Lockheed Martin's programs received the funding levels necessary to drive the growth outlook we previously identified, including our combat rescue helicopter, the C-130J, Blackhawk, CH-53K and FAAD. We view this funding outcome as positive for the future, and our current expectation is that growth will materialize over the longer term, starting in 2024. Let's now turn to the four growth pillars: programs of record, hypersonics, classified activities and new awards. With regard to programs of record, there were several important developments in key signature programs in our fourth quarter. On the F-35, the definitization of Lots 15 through 17, as I mentioned a minute ago, included the first F-35 aircraft to be produced for Belgium, Finland and Poland. We received authorization to procure long lead items for Lot 18 F-35 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy and U.S. allies as well. We also formally welcomed Germany, the ninth foreign military sales country, to the F-35 Lightning II program. And earlier in January, Canada officially became an F-35 operator as the country selected the aircraft to replace its aging fighter fleet. We continue to expect deliveries of the F-35 to ramp to 156 by 2025. Despite the temporary pause in flight operations and corresponding suspension of engine deliveries that began in December and resulted in the delivery of just 141 F-35s in 2022, seven shy of our expectation of 148 before the engine issue was discovered. Also in the quarter, the U.S. Navy authorized the CH-53K King Stallion heavy-lift helicopter to enter full rate production and then its deployment phase. This important milestone allows the program to proceed beyond low-rate initial production. And this achievement attests to our long-standing partnership with the U.S. Marine Corps and instills confidence and stability in Sikorsky's diverse domestic supply chain. In addition, at Sikorsky, international demand for the Black Hawk remains strong. Last week, the Australian Army announced it will acquire 40 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters to replace its current multi-role helicopter fleet. Deliveries are expected to begin for Australia this year. Further, the Lockheed Martin built Orion exploration class spacecraft launched on NASA's ARTEMIS 1 and completed a 25-day flight test, slashing down off the coast of California. This successful mission takes us one step closer to the first woman and first person of color setting foot on the moon. On its journey, Orion traveled more than 1.4 million miles through deep space and surpassed records for total distance. It traveled 270,000 miles from home and the farthest distance from earth by a spacecraft designed to carry humans. We look forward to the next stages of the program with seven additional missions under contract. Turning to hypersonics. In December, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control and the U.S. Air Force successfully conducted a hypersonic-boosted flight test of the Air-Launched Rapid Response Weapon. This was the first launch of a full prototype operational missile, meeting all its objectives for the test, including reaching speeds of greater than 5 times the speed of sound. With regard to classified programs, we achieved successful milestones across multiple business areas in 2022 and grew 5% year-over-year. We continue to expect growth in classified that will outpace the rest of the portfolio over the next several years. And finally, at new awards, Lockheed Martin's Next-Generation Interceptor, or NGI, continues to make progress. In late October, we announced the delivery of the first NGI flight software package to the Missile Defense Agency, providing the framework of software development tools, process workflows, scripts and environments. The delivery was ahead of schedule and is a critical step on the path for flight testing and fielding. This program remains a focused competition for Lockheed Martin with the first NGI forecast for delivery in 2027. With regard to the Future Long Range Assault Aircraft, or FLRAA, competition, we were disappointed in the U.S. Army's decision. And upon review, we determined a formal protest by Sikorsky on behalf of Team Defiant to be the best course of action. We continue to believe that Defiant X with its increased speed, range, manoeuvrability and survivability is the transformational and most cost-effective aircraft that best meets the selection criteria for this competition. Sikorsky remains one of two competitors for the other component of the Future Vertical Lift initiative that's called the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft, or FARA, which is currently expected to be awarded in 2025. The first RatorX-competitive prototype is over 90% complete and has more than 65% of its acceptance testers already done. Sikorsky is the only company with a representative FARA technology demonstrator aircraft. I saw it fly down at West Palm Beach a few months ago. It's amazing, the S97 RAIDER, which has completed more than 110 flight hours. In November, Norway became the first international customer for our new TPY-4 radar. It's the first software-defined radar that outperforms in target detection, mission diversity and transportability. Norway is going to receive eight of Lockheed Martin's TPY-4 radar with options for three additional radar. Finally, backlog ended 2022 at $150 billion with book-to-bill of 1.2 times and increases in every business area across Lockheed Martin. This strong demand signal bodes well for future growth over the longer term for our company. So, these four pillars will guide us as we face a challenging geopolitical environment and apply growth and integrated capabilities mindset to everything we do here. As conflict continues in Ukraine, unfortunately, and projected global threats require coordinated efforts to protect the U.S. and our allied territories, ongoing progress in our 21st Century Security vision will enable the acceleration of advanced capabilities to defer these threats and drive effective Joint All Domain Operations for our military service customers. In the fourth quarter, we continued to announce and expand strategic agreements with America's leading commercial digital companies, such as IBM's Red Hat, to advance artificial intelligence innovation on Lockheed Martin military platforms; and for Microsoft, with whom we're going to help power classified cloud advanced technologies for the Department of Defense. Microsoft's latest secure framework will make Lockheed Martin the first non-government entity to independently operate inside the Microsoft Azure Government Secret Cloud, ushering in a new era of cloud opportunities for the industry. As we look ahead, demand for Lockheed Martin platforms and systems is strong in the United States and abroad. We continue to expect 2023 sales about the same level as we discussed back in October. We also continue to expect a return to sustained top line growth in 2024 and beyond as headwinds diminish in our program mix, the supply chain continues to recover and our signature programs grow. Free cash flow per share will remain a key focus as we maximize returns for you, our shareholders. 2022 is a year of great accomplishments for our company in the face of a lot of dynamic challenges. The outstanding achievements of our teams resulted from real deep commitments across our business areas and better cooperation among them as well as our corporate functions to develop, produce and deliver world-class systems to our country and its allies. Our progress this year is a testament to the dedication of our 116,000 team members and the values we all share. So with that, let me hand it off to Jay to give more color on the financials, and we'll join you later to answer your questions. Jay? Yes. And as far as where the defense budget came out, David, it really aligns with our view in our company about the nature of the geopolitical threat, the need to modernize U.S. and allied forces to continue to hopefully deter armed conflict beyond the sad and unfortunate situation in the Ukraine that's already happened and the fact that there's bipartisan support in Congress to do just that. So we've been expecting all along in our kind of long-range plan that the U.S. government and Congress would step up to meet the reality of the global geopolitical situation. And that's exactly what played out in the budget process for FY '23. We also expect that same reality to continue to sadly exist again in the next budget cycle, which is happening even now in -- for 2024. So we don't see the circumstances the fundamentals changing. Therefore, we also believe that the continued robustness of the defense budget is going to be a reality as well. Sure, Myles. So as far as timing and resumption of deliveries on F-35, I think it's really important to differentiate between delivery and production, right? So we are continuing production in the final assembly factories at Fort Worth and Italy and in Japan at the same pace we expected to before the mishap occurred. We're also continuing to order and receive parts and materials from our supply chain as well. And so once an aircraft rolls out of the factory, our pilots and the DoD pilots conduct a handful of acceptance flights. That's what's kind of on hold right now is just that portion of the process. So the vast majority of our revenue, much greater than 90% is earned when the aircraft rolls out from the plant door. So Jay can add more color on the financial perspective, if you like, a little bit later, but that's really what happens. And so as far as the timing of resumption of deliveries, we'll be notified of that when the U.S. government and the propulsion supplier conclude their ongoing mishap investigation. Jay, do you want to add anything to that? Okay. And then secondly, we really can't predict the political dynamic in Congress and -- within and with the administration. So we're going to keep our head down, stay on our plan, do our job and expect that the right thing will occur at the other end of the 2024 budget process, which is fully funding and making available that funding to the department of defense, so we can deter conflict with them and that they can acquire what they need to do that. So that's our expectation. It's really difficult for us to lay out what we think the budget process will be given the nature of the House, Senate and the administration right now. But we expect that they are going to come together and do what's needed to defend the country and get the budget done. Sure. And it's largely classified, Rob. But what I can say is many of the elements of counter hypersonics, we also have a pole position in, right? So we've got existing products that we can take the lessons learned from and a lot of the engineering and apply them to just a faster incoming target, right? So we're working on NGI, as you already heard, which is a ballistic missile. It travels at similar speeds. We have the FAAD system, which is a sort of a high-altitude interceptor as well. And then we have PAC-3, which is a very accurate lower-level further in, if you will, defensive systems. So we've got the engineering talent. We've got the intellectual property. And we're developing these 21st Century Security concepts like applying artificial intelligence to network systems together and process data much more quickly, which, of course, you need that to process the information coming in on a Mach 5 missile, right? So I think we have a lot of the elements that will go into the eventual counter hypersonic solutions, and we are working on many of them right now in integrating what we have and developing what we need. Good morning. Well. Thanks. Rich, it's Jim. I'll start off quickly and hand it over to Jay for some of the background and data associated with the program. But the really great news is Block 70, which is the production article out of Greenville. The first Greenville Block 70 test flight was this morning was successful, really great milestone for the company and for that organization in South Carolina. But there's significant demand for this aircraft. A lot of coming organically, I guess, I'll call it, from allies around the world. Also, we're out actively marketing this jet to those countries that may not be authorized yet or maybe not have the infrastructure for F-35 at this moment but may in the future. India is one of those. I co-chair the U.S.-India CEO Forum with Secretary Raimondo. We're going to be going over there in a month or so with a team of CEOs from across our industry and meet with theirs and try to get collaboration going. And one of the, I would say, primary opportunities in that endeavour is the F-21, which is F-16 variant specifically designed for India, for example. So we haven't made that sale yet, but I can tell you all the way up to my level, we are out marketing F-16, and we have a lot of organic demand coming in from either existing, order customers or new ones. Jay, anything you want to add? Kristine, this is Jim. One of the first things I did when I came from the Board to active management was to double, as you said, to double the venture fund, right? So, it was $200 million, now it's $400 million. We're actively -- actually, very actively looking to invest that additional funding. In the great scheme of the company, though, it's really designed to discover emerging technology that might be applicable to our strategy and to our products and systems and help kind of develop that technology in a way that it can have utilization earlier than perhaps otherwise for our industry. So, we get the most benefit out of our venture fund in actual operations, production and development of platforms and systems. We have had a nice upturn in the valuations of those investments as well, but they're not necessarily driving the ultimate results or the ultimate growth prospect of the company, but they're indirectly doing just that. So Doug, let me take the first portion of your question, it's Jim, and then turn it over to Jay for the second piece on delivery numbers, et cetera. So Tech Refresh 3 is really important in a couple of dimensions. And you're accurate in mentioning and thank you for the first flight with the TR3 upgraded hardware and software was literally just a few weeks ago. We've got more software releases to go. We're going to add capability over the next couple of months. But we expect production of TR3-capable aircraft hopefully in this -- during the course of this year. That's our expectation. Now what that does for the customer and for us and our strategy is really kind of two major dimensions. One is for the capability of the aircraft itself. It will be able to handle more weapons. It will be able to upgrade electronic warfare capabilities. It will be able to accomplish more missions. So the basic functionality of the aircraft alone by itself is going to be elevated significantly by the insertion of this technology. And what is this technology? It's an updated core processor. So the -- basically the server for the airplane that it carries with it is going to the next-generation upgrade. The data storage is going to be vastly improved. And then the display is going to be modernized for the pilot, so what they see, how they interact with the jet and with other aircraft and systems around it. So those three things, right, data processing capability and speeds, data storage capacity, and the ability to interconnect with basically a modernized interface for the pilot along with the better capabilities they're going to have to interact with other aircraft to other systems because of TR3 are all of the characteristics that you need for an edge compute node in a modern 5G Internet of Things system and architecture, right? The three things are data storage, multi-cloud connection and processing power and speed. So we've actually killed two birds with one stone with TR3 here. On one hand, the aircraft is going to be much more capable in the kind of its traditional role. On the second hand, it's going to be way more capable, perhaps uniquely capable, in sort of the network Internet of Things or Joint All-Domain Operations of the future, right? That's what our customer calls that. So we have now the computing power and the capacity to serve as sort of the central aerial component of our 21st Century Security open architecture concept. And that's really the two pieces of F-35, TR3. They're super important. One is the airplane itself; and second, its ability to network with other systems and aircraft in an IoT-based architecture open architecture. Jay, do you want to speak to that? Yes. And Matt, it's Jim. One of the issues that this situation has illuminated with is that when you need to accelerate production in the defense enterprise for national defense, we would have liked to have been able to A, ramp up the production faster and B, bringing the revenue sooner. So it just highlights the need, I think, and it's an urgent one, to work together with government and industry to quickly evolve the relationship between the two so that we can maintain an effective deterrent conflict as we've talked about. So what I'm discussing with some of our senior government officials who are receptive, and there are several thought leaders in government on this now, is apply the concept of anti-fragility to the relationship between government and industry, meaning things like ensure that we have multiple reliable sources of key materials and components, right? So we have a lot of single-source components that we have to go back down into our supply chain and find out who and if they can double or triple their production of the components so we can double or triple the output of the system. Another piece of this anti-fragility concept is to have the government invest in production capacity with us, call it, 2 standard deviations above the mean peace time production rates. So if you need to accelerate, you can quickly and start up the line or speed up the line much faster. Another one is significant, expansion of the use of long-term and multiyear contracts so that we don't have to have a fluctuation in demand year-to-year, which sets our supply base back, again, less willing to invest because they can't predict the future. And then finally, especially for those small and medium businesses, we're suggesting that government really take an overview of a broad overview of the oversight and compliance burdens that are on companies that participate in the defense industrial base from an audit and compliance and certified cost perspective, truth and negotiation act, things like that, while we at Lockheed Martin and other major defense funds would like to see that burden ease, it's a burden that can really prohibit other medium and small companies from working with us or working with the government to provide what it needs. So there's a great dialogue beginning. I'm sure other companies are raising these issues too. But this issue of restocking raised an important industry issue that we're going to try to work with government to solve. Great. Thanks, Maria. I'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire Lockheed Martin community for everything they've done in 2022 and they'll do this year and beyond. Together, we positioned our company to continue to push the edge of the technology and advance scientific discovery to ensure our customers remain what we call ahead of ready and keep people safe around the globe. So thanks again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next call in April. John, that concludes the call. Thanks, everybody. Have a great day."

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results for 2022, additional business area detail and offer a first full look at 2023 guidance. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart three, an overview of our consolidated 2022 financials. Lockheed Martin followed up a solid third quarter with a strong finish to 2022, highlighted by 7% year-over-year sales growth in the fourth quarter and effectively managed a turbulent year impacted by COVID and supply chain disruptions as well as inflation levels not seen in decades. Besides sales, we also exceeded our expectations for segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow, all while absorbing incremental headwinds tied to restructuring activities within RMS and mark-to-market losses in our investment portfolios. We also booked record orders in 2022, resulting in 11% growth to an ending backlog of $150 billion. In addition to our orders on F-35, we experienced a surge in new interest for our industry-leading security solutions, such as in classified programs in Space and in Missiles and Fire Control, where we booked approximately $1.5 billion in orders, reflecting increased demand to replenish U.S. stocks and enhance security positions globally. And we delivered on our commitment to boost shareholder returns by deploying nearly $11 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends while making significant investments in our businesses. Taken together, these results demonstrate the perseverance of our dedicated employees to perform in challenging environments and support our expectations for 2023 and beyond. Taking a closer look at full year results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit on Chart four. Sales came in higher than expected by nearly $750 million, limiting the decline to 2% year-over-year and essentially recovering to the sales guidance we had originally communicated last January. The stronger-than-expected performance was broad-based across all four business areas and reflects strong coordination with supplier partners to drive material throughput and program schedule performance as well as some favourable award timing, which drove additional revenue. Segment operating profit declined 2% year-over-year but also finished higher than expected by almost $50 million driven by the higher sales. Operating margins settled at 10.9%, slightly lower year-over-year and versus expectations based on lower net favourable profit adjustments. Moving to earnings per share on Chart five. Adjusted earnings per share grew 2% for the year as the benefit from share repurchases overcame headwinds from lower segment profit and FAS/CAS pension income. Moving to cash flow on Chart six. We delivered $6.1 billion of free cash flow for the year while investing almost $1.7 billion in CapEx at a ratio of 1.4 times depreciation. We also ended the year with nearly $1.5 billion of accelerated payments to our suppliers, maintaining our commitment to a resilient supply chain. As I noted earlier, 2022 represented a significant year of cash deployment. In total, we returned 178% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2022, leveraging our performance and strong balance sheet while still investing for our anticipated growth trajectory in 2024 and beyond. Okay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart seven. Full year sales grew 1% year-over-year primarily driven by increases in our classified programs, partially offset by lower F-35 production volume. Operating profit increased 2% driven by higher net favourable profit adjustments more than offsetting the impact of the lower volume. For the year, backlog at Aeronautics grew 15%. As mentioned, Aeronautics completed the F-35 Lot 15 through 17 negotiations and secured production volumes while providing the services with a value proposition that combines the highest performance at affordable cost. Looking at Missiles and Fire Control on Page eight. Sales decreased 3% driven primarily by lower volume on our special ops sustainment program following the Afghan withdrawal, along with lower volume on sensors programs. Segment operating profit was down 1% with lower favourable profit adjustments primarily on PAC-3. For the year, backlog increased 6% on the back of tactical missile strength. At Rotary and Mission Systems on Page nine, sales decreased year-over-year by 4% driven primarily by a non-recurring revenue event in our training business in 2021 along with lower C6ISR and Black Hawk volume at Sikorsky. Operating profit decreased 7%, following Sikorsky and C6ISR volume and lower favourable profit adjustments on the Black Hawk program. Backlog grew 4% in 2022, led by the Defense of Guam award, where RMS will be the lead integrator of the multi-domain air and missile defense system as well as stronger Sikorsky orders. Turning to Chart 10 in our Space business area. Sales decreased 2% due to the 2021 renationalization of the AWE program, partially offset by growth on a Next-Generation Interceptor program and national security space. Operating profit decreased 8% with lower net profit adjustments, partially offset by higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Backlog grew 16% based on strong classified program captures and Orion orders. So all told, a strong finish to the year. So let's now shift to 2023 on Page 11. Before introducing our expectations, I'd like to inform you of a reporting change in segment operating profit starting in 2023. We will report purchased intangible asset amortization expense in unallocated corporate expense below segment operating profit. Previously, intangible amortization was included in segment operating profit. This change will not impact total earnings, and we believe the change provides a more accurate view of operating performance for each of our four business areas. The impact is approximately 40 basis points on our 2023 expectations, consistent with the impact in previous years.  Our 2023 financial outlook includes the impact of this change, and you can find supporting data for these adjustments in the appendices of our web charts as well as in the earnings release.  Okay, let's get into the outlook for 2023. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $65 billion to $66 billion and the midpoint is slightly below 2022. Speaking to the timing of sales this year, we expect the first quarter to be our lowest quarter of the year, ramping up quarter-over-quarter as we did in 2022. Segment operating profit for 2023 normalized for intangible asset amortization has improved what we thought -- from what we thought in October. And we now estimate only 10 basis points of headwind from 2022 with segment operating margins at 11.1% under our new reporting. We currently expect $2.1 billion of FAS/CAS income in 2023. It's estimated to be roughly $100 million lower in '22, excluding the impact from our pension transfer transaction. Our earnings per share is expected to be between $26.60 and $26.90 for '23 with the year-over-year reduction to adjusted EPS primarily driven by lower segment operating profit in FAS/CAS income, partially offset by the benefit from a lower share count. Our free cash flow estimate for 2023 is greater to or equal than $6.2 billion and assumes continued enactment of the R&D tax capitalization.  This increase of $100 million to cash generation, along with our share repurchase guide of another $4 billion, highlights our continued focus on increasing free cash flow per share for our shareholders. This projected combination of higher free cash flow and a lower share count lead to a mid-single-digit growth expectation in free cash flow per share in 2023. Okay. On Chart 20 -- on Chart 12, let's sum it all up. We closed out 2022 with a strong finish with operating momentum and a robust backlog, which have us well positioned to resume growth in 2024 and beyond. We also placed a premium on leveraging our strong cash generation and balance sheet to increase cash returns to our shareholders with a significant increase to share repurchases. Across all four business areas, our breadth of development, production and sustainment programs continue to drive a foundation of growth and sustained high performance. And we will work actively with our customers to meet their increasing demands and mission requirements looking ahead to the future. Our investments for growth, value and efficiency are aligned with our strategy for technology advancement and improved synergies across Lockheed Martin. So in closing, we believe the business is well positioned for long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders.  With that, John, let's open up the call for Q&A. So David, let me take the first one and then kick over the second part of your question to Jim and just really talk in the context of '23 and what's going to be different in 2024. In 2023, when you look at it, we've got continued growth in our four pillars, really the programs of record that Jim had mentioned. But we do have some specific unique items to 2023, and I'll give you an example. For example, in aero. On the F-35, we continue to expect mid-single-digit growth in sustainment on the program. But we are expecting also a mid-single-digit decline in production as deliveries catch up to the material that we had purchased in prior years. Similarly, on the F-16, we're going to see continued growth in production to roll out our backlog, but we are seeing a reduction in modernization and sustainment programs on the F-16. So as those -- both of those normalize in 2023 going into 2024, they will no longer be headwinds, which will continue to allow for growth in Aeronautics, particularly in the F-35 sustainment and on F-16 production. Similarly, like MFC, what we saw in 2022 and it carries over a little bit to 2023 is some of the areas where we see the higher demand from a production level, particularly in programs of record, things like PAC-3, it's taken us a little bit longer than we originally expected to ramp up. And so we're going to see gradual improvement in supply chain as well as our internal operations in '23 with stronger growth in 2024. At RMS, CH-53 will double deliveries in '24 versus '23. And '23 versus '22 is pretty much flat deliveries. We also see probably some Black Hawk growth in '24 as well. And what we're going through right now is the transition for multiyear 9 to multiyear 10 in RMS and Sikorsky specifically. So those are all things that we think will lift from '24 relative to '23, and those are headwinds that are really unique to 2023. Just let me follow up on your last question, David, whether or not there's upside. Where we see potential increases to where we were at baseline before really is in MFC. Over the next five years, we've got revenue potential. It's around $6 billion. And that would more than offset lost revenue associated with FLRAA should that decision hold. And so net-net, we see that there could be some upside over the next five years. No. You got it. That's it. Sure. Good question. Let me follow up. And we looked at this and tried to triangulate performance in a number of different ways. We looked at just straight piece part on-time delivery here in the fourth quarter relative to what we saw in the second and the third. We also looked at program performance, so earn value-type metrics, and we really didn't see a meaningful change in on-time delivery or schedule performance relative to our earned value systems. But what I will say is the fourth quarter had a significant step-up in requirements. And if you adjust for the number of weeks in the fourth quarter relative to the balance of the year and you also adjust for some of these benefits that we saw in terms of award timing, our requirements in the fourth quarter stepped up sequentially by about 5%. And I would say the entire value chain, whether it's our internal operations and the supply chain, was able to meet that increased level of requirements. So that, to me, bodes well to the future as well as expecting a gradual improvement in 2023. And I think that just provides a reasonable assumption and a reasonable basis for that assumption Okay. So George, I can probably answer your questions with one yes, but maybe I'll provide a little bit of color there. I now take the -- you're correct, on the charge we took, that was related to the program. We continue to have some learnings there. But our team, I think, in Skunk Works is doing a great job managing that program. And this is a development program where you see and you continue to have learnings. But in the grand scheme of things, I think we've managed that quite well. And it really hasn't -- did not impact our results. And as far as the F-35 program, we did see some benefits there. And you're right, in the quarter, we were -- the results there were augmented not only by the volume but as well as the net profit adjustments at Aeronautics, and it was across the board. I think next year, as we think about the margin, yes, there's a little bit of a headwind there. I think mix does play a part in it as well as right now, we're planning a little bit lower favourable profit adjustments. But for the year, in the grand scheme of Lockheed Martin, this year, we did about 25% of profit in net profit adjustments, and we would expect that to be somewhat similar for the entire company for '23. Thanks for the question, George. Sure. Just maybe a little bit more color. Just on top of the first flight that we had today the successful first flight, congratulations to our Aeronautics team there. We have over 20 aircraft that are currently in process in the production phase. We will deliver anywhere between, say, 78 aircraft this year, and then that will step up significantly in 2024. And so we're on a good path that we recognize the opportunities that are in front of us. There are a few countries that have been announced there that we're eagerly awaiting contract finalization, hopefully this year, with Jordan and Bulgaria. That's about combined about 20 aircraft. And so the demand, as Jim mentioned, is pretty significant. And we're ramping up as we speak to be able to deliver the customer requirements. Yes. I mean -- so for cash this year, as we mentioned, that will decline this year. I said about $100 million. Specifically, the CAS element will decline by about -- the recoveries by about $75 million. We'll see that decline a little bit more over the next few years as well. And so it will come down in the range, I think, around $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion over the next few years. And so that's the best outlook we have today. As you know, these things are -- they do fluctuate and a little volatile. So we'll update that accordingly as we go and think about next year and what that means for 2025, Seth. Yes. No, good question. This is something we talked a little bit on the third quarter call. We've got some new program awards, particularly in classified, that are going to put margin pressure not just next year but a few years beyond that as well. And it's really just on the early phase of these programs as we head into production. It's just low margin, and it will take time to have those restore to margins that we've seen in the past. What I will say is that we do have the benefit of some offsetting mix with the upside that we're seeing in this business. I mentioned before a potential $6 billion over the next five years. Those will come with more solid margins will help mitigate the reduction that we're seeing on these new programs. But there will be some pressure there that we have to deal with. And look, the MFC team has a good track record of driving out cost, driving margins. I'm confident they'll be able to do that in the future as well, but it will take a few years to get there. I'll just add, Kristine, I mean it's a great point. I mean we've got a pretty tight alignment on the targets that we pursue to our technology road maps. And these are examples like Joint All Domain Operations interoperability, autonomy, artificial intelligence and other areas that will help us drive and accelerate our internal organic capability with these new emerging technologies. And so it's a great point. There's certainly opportunity there. As Jim mentioned, we've increased our availability of funding for that, and we're excited about those opportunities. Sure. Good question. We remain confident in the position that we've taken. We've had really no dialogue. We are awaiting guidance from the IRS on what contracts specifically would be covered. You're right that different players have taken different positions. We remain confident in our position. We believe that the risk is a factor. And when you are under particularly cost-type contracts, there is no risk taken by the provider of those services. Secondly, we believe the benefit is marginal because the owner or the contractor of that work is really the one that takes over that technology and can transfer it to others at any point in time. And so we think that those are sound base and sound arguments supported by legal teams that we have in a position that we've taken. But again, it's uncertain -- and our uncertain tax position really reflects that uncertainty. So, I can't give you specific one way or the other in terms of IRS positions because we just don't know as of yet. But I can tell you, we spent a lot of time researching this, a lot of time discussing it, deliberating it internally, and we think the position that we've come out is the right position. Yes. Rob, inflation is something that we evaluate all the time. In many of our existing contracts, we have not really seen a significant impact, only because I mean our fixed price contracts -- our suppliers are under fixed price contracts with us. Where we have seen is really on new proposals is where we've seen some impacts, where you've got suppliers unwilling to provide longer-term price commitments requesting what we refer to in the industry as economic price adjustments, which are escalation clauses, inflation clauses. And those are ongoing dialogues that we have with our customers as well. And so it's still an ongoing issue. To be honest with you, on the proposal side, we really haven't seen any type of reduction there in the pressure. It's something that we review quite often on these new proposals, and it's something that we grapple with because either you have to price in some type of inflation assumption into your proposal or you have to have some type of back-to-back agreement where you're going to have an inflation clause. And we're getting squeezed with our customer as well as with our suppliers, and we're trying to make sure that we can accommodate both requirements here. You think about a few of these, it's something that we have -- I mean you know that the F-35, so we've got waiting for the -- we're expecting the production order on Lot 17 in 2023. We do have a large missile -- air and missile defense program -- international program. It's an important program for us this year. And so it's probably back half of the year type of decision. That is included in our four pillars of growth when we talk about new awards. There are other programs here that are classified, really can't get into kind of the detail of those, but we expect some of those awards to be made either at the tail end of this year or into next year as well. And in NGI, we would expect to down-select around 2025. And so there's a fair amount of markers out there in some of these programs that I just spoke between now, really in 2025, that certainly are important to us. Jim mentioned FARA. That's probably a 2025 decision as well. Yes. Let me maybe talk a bit in the kind of longer-term outlook. And you look at the history of Lockheed Martin over the last probably five to 10 years, and we've reached margins in the range of 12%. I do believe we have the potential to get back to those, but that will take time. In the short term, really, I would say, over the next three years or so, our objective will be just to hold the margins where they are because some of these pressures that we see on these new programs, particularly at MFC, when you've got a 90 basis point reduction in one year from -- in one BA, that's a lot to really overcome. We've worked things internally as far as both product cost reductions, overhead cost reductions to really try to drive and maintain our margin profile. But that's where we're really going to be over the next few years is really trying to maintain where we are as we re-crank the growth cycle. And I think that's the key message that we have had internally: let's re-crank the growth cycle, get ourselves in 2024 on track to deliver the growth. As we get that flywheel turning, then we'll be able to focus and turn back around on margins and start improving margins. Sure. To answer the question on add-ons, that is -- will be -- that will occur but not necessarily in 2023. If you think about it right now, we're going to be introducing and cutting in new production, hardware and software on a full rate production program, which is a pretty aggressive schedule. And so what I would expect -- and this is included in our sustainment revenue growth projections, we'll see the retrofits on the existing fleet over time. And that will probably start beginning maybe sometime in 2024 and beyond, and its part of our mid-single-digit sustainment growth on the F-35. Yes. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've got about -- we had orders of about $1.5 billion. We'll start delivering on some of that in 2023, and that will carry over into 2024. We've got a line of sight to significantly more orders beyond that, that we'll see again in the outer years. And so it's still to be determined. But what I can say is that we have had contract funding and internally funded projects to make sure we can meet higher ramp rates, whether it's HIMARS, GMLRS, PAC-3, all of those, all are opportunities from where we are today and part of the investment that our customer is making and that we are making to drive the higher ramp rates."

With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2022 earnings call as we review our quarterly results, our 2022 full-year outlook, and our preliminary expectations for 2023. But before we begin, I\u2019d like to welcome Maria, who I\u2019m excited to tell you all, has started as our new Vice President of Investor Relations just yesterday. I\u2019d also like to thank Greg, who announced his plan to retire at the end of the year for his more than 37 years of dedicated service at Lockheed Martin, including five terrific years as our Vice President of Investor Relations. It\u2019s been a pleasure to work with you, Greg, and we wish you all the best in retirement.\nGreg Gardner: Thank you, Jim.\nJim Taiclet: I\u2019d also like to note that we continue to await the U.S. Army\u2019s selection for its Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft competition, FLRAA, as it is known. We\u2019ll modernize the Army\u2019s rotorcraft fleet and represent a long-term franchise growth opportunity. We are confident that DEFIANT X is the transformational aircraft that the U.S. Army\u2019s going to need to accomplish its complex missions today and well into the future, and we look forward to the Army\u2019s announcement. Lockheed Martin had a solid quarter financially with 3% increase in sales from last year\u2019s third quarter, and strong operating margins and earnings per share. Our free cash flow was outstanding as we generated $2.7 billion in the quarter. And our backlog grew nearly $5 billion, closing at $140 billion. We remain on track to achieve the full year outlook for all of our financial metrics that we discussed last quarter. In a few minutes, Jay will provide a detailed review of our quarterly results, updated 2022 guidance and trending information. But before he does that, I will provide a framework for our outlook, and discuss our plans for delivering value to customers and shareholders over the next several years. We continue to anticipate growth over the long term, but with the residual pandemic impacts and supply chain challenges continuing, we now expect a return to growth in 2024 with 2023 sales being approximately equal to our 2022 outlook. We are confident in our four pillars to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Importantly, we expect to deliver solid growth and free cash flow per share in 2023 and thereafter through a combination of cost reductions throughout the business, improved working capital management, and an expanded share of purchase program. Our Board of Directors has approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization to $14 billion. You will see in Jay\u2019s charts that we\u2019re doubling our share repurchase plan outlook for this year, increasing our outlook by $4 billion for a total expectation of $8 billion in 2022. We also announced a 7% dividend increase this quarter. So altogether, we\u2019re on track to deliver approximately $11 billion to shareholders in 2022. We are also elevating our commitment to drive long-term growth through strong independent research and development and capital expenditure funding with an expected total of nearly $4 billion in 2023. These investments will support our customers and deliver on our 21st century security vision to accelerate leading edge, commercial digital technologies, and defense of our nation and allies. A key driver of this strategy is our new One LM transformation, or as we call it, One LMX, [ph] a multi-billion-dollar, seven-year company-wide program to transform our end-to-end business processes and systems. One LMX will create a model-based enterprise with a fully integrated digital thread throughout the design, build, and sustained product lifecycle. As part of our ongoing corporate stewardship approach, we are conducting an internal review to identify potential synergies between our four business areas, further cost reduction opportunities, and a general portfolio review with the goal of increasing operating efficiency in anticipation of our future growth. We are confident in long term growth as domestic and international demand for a wide range of our products and services remain strong. We will continue to actively reinvest capital into our business to meet our customers\u2019 requirements and drive organic growth, and we\u2019ll use our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process and strong balance sheet to drive attractive total returns for shareholders. Moving on, I\u2019d like to highlight a few key accomplishments from each of our business areas, beginning with an update on our F-35 program. Last month, the Swiss government signed a letter of offer and acceptance for the procurement of 36 F-35As. This milestone completes the government-to-government procurement process that was first announced in June 2021 when the Swiss Federal Council shared its selection of the F-35 for its future fighter. The signing officially makes Switzerland the 15th F-35 customer. Also, in August, we received contractual authorization from the Joint Program Office, enabling us to book a Lot 15 order of over $7.5 billion and recognize revenues and earnings from the second quarter as well as from the third quarter. Our Space team celebrated the successful launch and deployment of the space-based infrared system GEO-6 satellite, the final spacecraft in the SBIRS constellation. SBIRS has been one of our longest running signature programs, providing the Space Force with an integrated system for missile warning, battlespace awareness, and intelligence gathering. We will also continue to support and advance this important mission through our next generation Overhead Persistent Infrared or next gen OPIR program, which will deliver even more advanced and more survivable missile warning capabilities to the country. At Rotary and Mission Systems, the Sikorsky line of business secured an order for 12 SEAHAWK helicopters from the Australian Ministry of Defense. Over the past 40 years, we\u2019ve delivered over a 1,000 SEAHAWKs to the U.S. and international customers both with more than 50 remaining in backlog. And in Missiles and Fire Control, the State Department approved a potential sale to the United Arab Emirates for two THAAD systems, including 96 interceptors. The UAE currently operates two THAAD batteries, and this opportunity would significantly increase their air and missile defense capabilities, and once finalized, could be worth over $2.2 billion. Turning to budgets, both chambers of Congress have advanced Appropriation bills in support of fiscal year 2023 Department of Defense budgets. We have seen strong bipartisan support for increased defense funding in congressional authorization and appropriation committees. Final legislation approving these funds has yet to be passed, and the federal government is currently operating under a short term continuing resolution for FY23, limiting DOD funding to prior FY 2022 levels. As part of the continuing resolution, Congress did approve additional supplemental spending to support efforts in Ukraine for the defense of their country. The CR added $3 billion in funding for Ukraine Security Assistance Initiatives, a program to provide equipment, weapons, and military support to Ukraine, bringing the total amount appropriated for this effort to $9 billion. In addition, the continuing resolution appropriated $2 billion to replenish U.S. stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine and to increase production of critical munitions with a presidential drawdown authority funding now having been increased to over $14 billion since the beginning of the year. The international community has also increased their focus on global security with nations across the world having announced a planned five-year increase in defense budget funding of approximately $60 billion in total. We continue to have discussions with customers to expand the manufacturing of multiple products and have submitted offers for consideration. While many of these contracting actions remain in the early stages and may take time to be fully implemented, we believe our signature programs and 21st century security technologies have us well positioned to address the challenges presented by a resurgence in global great power competition. Turning to our 21st century security strategy, I\u2019d like to highlight two examples of Lockheed Martin\u2019s leadership in deterrence technologies and how our 5G.MIL open architecture can be used to enhance performance and drive effective Joint All-Domain Operations?  During the third quarter, Lockheed Martin and AT&T teamed to transfer UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter flight and performance data from an aircraft at flying in Connecticut to receiving location in Colorado, using both an AT&T 5G private cellular network and Lockheed Martin\u2019s 5G.MIL multi-site pilot network. Operational performance was also improved with the efficiencies introduced by this technology, shortening the total processing time of the task by nearly 85%. Also this quarter, Lockheed Martin and Verizon flew 5G enabled drones to capture and securely transfer high speed, real time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data from aircraft and flight to geolocate simulated adversarial positions. This demonstration showed the capabilities of our hybrid base station to bridge commercial and military technologies together, providing our service members with enhanced deterrent capabilities and further enabling the mission all the way out to the actual battlefield. With that, I will turn the call over to Jay and join you later to answer your questions.\nJay Malave: Thanks Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results, business area detail, provide an update to our 2022 outlook as well as offer some thoughts on 2023 and beyond. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let\u2019s begin with chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated third quarter financials. Lockheed Martin delivered solid results for the quarter. To start, we generated sequential sales growth of 7% to $16.6 billion, as anticipated. Segment operating profit was $1.9 billion at an 11.2% margin with earnings per share of $6.71, reflecting solid underlying performance that absorbed $0.16 of mark to market headwinds. We also increased backlog with a 1.3 book-to-bill ratio, driven by the F-35 production Lot 15 contract action. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $2.7 billion, further enabling the execution of our disciplined and dynamic cash deployment strategy and returning over $2 billion through share purchases and dividends.  Turning to consolidated sales and segment operating profit results on chart 4. Total sales increased 3% from the third quarter of 2021 with growth in three of our four business areas. Segment operating profit was up slightly, as the benefits from higher volume and equity earnings more than offset lower step-ups than last year. Moving to earnings per share on chart 5. On a reported basis, earnings per share were higher by $4.50. Adjusting for last year\u2019s pension transfer transaction and mark to market accounting, EPS grew 4%, primarily reflecting the benefits of higher operating profit and the lower share count. All in all, solid results that position us well to meet our full-year commitments.  Moving to cash flow on chart 6, we delivered our strongest quarter of cash flow year-to-date, with strong collections driving $2.7 billion in free cash flow this quarter while maintaining accelerated payments of $1.1 billion to suppliers. Shareholder cash deployment continues to exceed free cash flow year-to-date with 121% of free cash flow deployed through dividends and share repurchases. We have substantially completed our $4 billion -- our original $4 billion 2022 buyback target. As we announced this quarter, we also increased our dividend 7%, now paying an annualized dividend of $12 per share. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on chart 7. Third quarter sales increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher F-35 production volume, including the recognition of $325 million of sales that were deferred from the second quarter associated with the Lot 15 contract action. Increased volume in our classified programs at Skunk Works also contributed to the growth. Operating profit increased 6%, primarily following the sales volume increases on F-35, partially offset by lower margins on classified programs. Moving to Missiles and Fire Control on page 8. Sales increased 2%, driven primarily by increased volume on PAC-3 interceptors. Segment operating profit was down 8% as lower favorable profit adjustments this quarter more than offset the benefit from higher volume. At Rotary and Mission Systems on page 9, sales decreased year-over-year by 5%, driven primarily by lower Black Hawk production volume at Sikorsky. Operating profit decreased 10%, following Sikorsky production volume and lower favorable profit adjustments this quarter on the Black Hawk program. Turning to chart 10 in our Space business area. Sales were up 7%, driven primarily by the continued ramp of the next-generation interceptor program. Operating profit increased 14% following the volume increase, along with higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Okay. Moving to our updated outlook for 2022 on page 11. We are maintaining our guidance from last quarter for sales, earnings per share and free cash flow. With the announcement this morning of a $14 billion repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors, we\u2019ve increased our forecast for share buybacks to approximately $8 billion for the year, an increase of $4 billion from our prior expectation, reflecting our confidence in the long-term growth outlook and amplifying per share value creation. We expect the EPS benefit from our incremental planned buybacks this year to be offset by the third quarter mark-to-market headwinds and therefore are holding our current EPS guide of $21.55 for the year. Also, while our consolidated outlook did not change, we did have some puts and takes between the business areas, and you can find that detail in our backlog charts. On chart 12, we\u2019ve laid out our preliminary framework of expectations for 2023. As we\u2019ve discussed before, we remain confident in sustained growth, driven by four pillars: those are programs of record, classified programs, hypersonics, and new awards. This is supported by the higher backlog through the third quarter and further growth expected by year-end. We do anticipate flattish sales in 2023, however, primarily due to the delayed sales conversion in our programs of record backlog as the expected recovery from COVID and supply chain shortages will be more gradual than previously expected. In our classified businesses, we expect another year of growth in 2023. This growth, along with our contract mix headwinds, will be accompanied by pressure of approximately 20 to 30 basis points in overall company segment operating margin, all compared to our 2022 outlook. We are confident that through cost reduction and business area synergy actions, we can work to limit this downward pressure. Importantly, through management focus and aggressive working capital actions, our expectations for 2023 free cash flow remain unchanged in spite of the top line and margin pressure. Looking forward, we are confident in the Company\u2019s prospects for growth and value creation. With our aggressive share buyback plan, we anticipate repurchasing approximately 10% of our shares outstanding over the next several years. And coupled with a sustained free cash flow, we expect to deliver outstanding long-term value to shareholders. Okay. So, let\u2019s wrap up on chart 13. Our business area operational and financial performance in the third quarter was solid, and we are increasing our outlook for cash return to shareholders. We continue to invest in innovative solutions, including commercial technologies in support of our customers\u2019 important missions and 21st Century Security. Our focus remains on strong cash generation, and combined with our robust balance sheet and discipline and dynamic capital deployment strategy allow us to deliver long-term value to shareholders. Before we open up to Q&A, I would also like to thank Greg Gardner for his 37 years of dedicated service and contributions to the Company. He\u2019s been an outstanding partner and resource to all that he has supported. We wish him well in the next phase of his life. Greg will remain with us through the end of the year to transition Maria Ricciardone Lee. Maria brings Investor Relations experience from multiple companies, including UTX where we both worked together. She\u2019s an excellent financial executive and thought partner, and I\u2019m excited that she is joining the team. With that, John, let\u2019s open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we have line of Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning. Also, I\u2019d say all the best to Greg, and welcome, Maria, the two of you again. But in terms of questions, Jay, on your outlook for 2023, I know you\u2019re not going to go into a lot of detail here, full guidance be going next quarter. But you mentioned that classified is going to be going up but overall are going to be flattish. So, what\u2019s coming down next year, and what\u2019s causing that?\nJay Malave: Yes. We have some program transitions, Rob. And maybe I\u2019ll just maybe go through around some of the business areas to give you a little bit of color there. When you look at aero next year, we expect that to probably be in the range of being down -- flat to down slightly. And that\u2019s on the back really of lower production volume on the F-35. We expect that to be done -- even though sales -- or the deliveries will be generally flat. We recorded sales in advance of that with long lead procurement in 2021 and 2022. So, it will be a period of catch-up on sales for aero there. So, that\u2019s going to be the biggest driver there, but we\u2019ll expect that to abate when we go into 2024. At MFC, we\u2019ve got some -- just some timing, so program timing, particularly in our sensors business, we expect them to be probably flattish to down slightly as well. And then, we expect some growth -- low-single-digit growth at both RMS and Space. And RMS will just be driven by new programs. And at Space, we have -- our national security business is down, but we\u2019ve got other programs that are spiking up there. And so, that\u2019s generally what\u2019s driving it, I\u2019d say, by business area and by segment. So slightly down in a few and slightly up in others, and our balance will be flat.\nOperator: And our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: Jim, can you walk through why you think growth is going to start again in 2024? I mean, what underlies that? And maybe one of the things I scratched my head on a bunch is you\u2019ve got, what, the 15th customer for F-35. It looks like there might even be some more within the next year or so. So, how do we think about that growth recovery? What\u2019s going to underlie that? And why are F-35 levels at a higher rate of production than where they are today? And could they go higher?\nJim Taiclet: Sure. Ryan, it\u2019s Jim here. So, the two biggest pieces of our four pillars of growth are programs of record, and I\u2019ll speak to a few of those in a second, and the classified business we have. And both of those are going to ramp up from 2023 to 2024 meaningly we feel. And the biggest piece of all -- again, the programs of record are going to come into 3 or 4 very identifiable areas. One is the F-35 sustainment, right? So with more aircraft out flying, there\u2019s going to be more of a overhaul, repair, spare parts support, those kinds of activities, going on. And that\u2019s going to continue over a number of years. So F-35 sustainment is a growth area. In MFC, the PAC-3 is resurging. There\u2019s interest in various parts of the world, the Middle East, Europe and Asia now, for PAC-3. So the capabilities of that air defense system are really going to be kicking into gear for the Company in the next couple of years, including in 2024. Along with that, similarly, the CH-53K is going to move up the production rate significantly, and there\u2019s some additional international interest there. That aircraft can do lift capability that far exceeds any other that\u2019s ever been built in history. And it\u2019s, I think, going to get even more uptake as time goes on. And the fourth among many of the programs of record that will grow is fleet ballistic missile that the U.S. Navy is essentially going to revamp for the second time the Trident fleet ballistic missile system. And that\u2019s a Lockheed Martin franchise that will continue to grow, again starting in 2024. On the classified side, 2023 is helpful, but not really the ramp that will come in 2024. So, between programs of record and classified, you\u2019re going to get the bulk of that growth. On F-35, the U.S. government has got to kind of determine what its budget priorities are at the macro level going forward. One of those has been nuclear deterrents. And so, between the bomber program, the ground-based missile recapitalization and the fleet ballistic missile that I just mentioned, there\u2019s going to be a significant amount of defense budget proportionately spent on the nuclear revitalization. But also the conventional threats have gotten worse instead of better as we look forward into the next 2 or 3, 4 years, and that\u2019s going to be a budget issue for the U.S. government. We\u2019ve recommended, and I think the services would support, a steady production rate of 156 aircraft starting again in the 2024 time frame when we can get back up to that based on the COVID recovery for our supply chain. And I think that\u2019s supportable. And it takes about 80 U.S. aircraft to make that happen per year with another 75 or so coming from international. We see the international demand -- and it\u2019s going to be up to the U.S. government to try to support that 80 number between the congressional committee processes for authorization and appropriation along with the President\u2019s budgets going forward. So, we hope for that. We expect it because that\u2019s the need, and that\u2019s where we think the F-35 program is going to go. But again, in FY23, we won\u2019t have that full ramp-up yet.\nJay Malave: Let me just -- to maybe add a little bit to it as well, Ron. Just to augment, some of the things that we\u2019re seeing in 2023, we\u2019ve got some expected abating headwinds when we go into 2024. Jim mentioned a little bit on supply chain. That\u2019s primarily affected our programs of record. And so, those should lift by the time we get to 2024. We also have a few program transitions in 2023 that will also allow for easier comparison when we get into 2024. And so for example, I just mentioned the F-35 where production will be down next year. Those will normalize when we get into 2024, which will allow our sustainment to grow, as Jim mentioned. We\u2019ll also see accelerated growth in the F-16 program. As you may recall, that program slipped to the right, but in 2024, we expect that to accelerate. In Space, as Jim mentioned, FBM, there are other programs such as NGI that will continue to grow. And so we\u2019ve got some things where we\u2019re cycling down this -- on 2023 on the SBIRS program and even things like next-gen GEO or OPIR, again, those headwinds will abate as we get into 2024. Similarly, on MFC, Jim mentioned the PAC-3 program. We\u2019ll see also continued growth there in the classified programs as well. And then at RMS, as Jim mentioned, also at CH-53K, there\u2019s also other radar programs as well as Joint All Domain-type programs like Defense of Guam that will drive some growth in those years. So, all of these areas and these programs are the ones that we have pretty clear visibility to. They do assume obviously that there is abatement to an improvement in supply chain. That\u2019s 15 months from now for improvement that we expect to occur.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMatt Akers: Greg, best of luck and good working with you. I wanted to ask about Future Vertical Lift, FLRAA, just what you\u2019re hearing from your customers there on the delays? And any indication of what\u2019s driving that? And when do you think that contract might be up?\nJim Taiclet: Matt, it\u2019s Jim. The only thing we could say about the schedule for FLRAA decision is what the U.S. government puts out publicly. So, we don\u2019t have anything else to add to that. It\u2019s their schedule and time line, and we think we\u2019ve put in a terrific offer. And also having been around some of these helicopter pilots in my Air Force time, they actually scared the heck out of me a couple of times when I flew with them. They want to be low. They want to be maneuverable below the tree line. And I\u2019ve seen the FARA and FLRAA fly. They can do it. There\u2019s a video you can look at on YouTube that shows you how amazing this helicopter technology is. And it also gets you up to like a 230- to 250-knot forward speed when you need it. So, it gives the best of both worlds if you\u2019re in the rotorcraft business as a flyer. You get good forward speed that\u2019s faster than it\u2019s ever been for a traditionally designed helicopter because of our counter-rotating rotors. And it also gives you the maneuverability even better than many of the traditional helicopters could have provided. So, we think it\u2019s the best solution for the actual frontline Army or other service pilot, and it\u2019s going to be up the U.S. government to see where they come out on that. But the schedule is theirs, and we can\u2019t really comment on it.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.\nPete Skibitski: Greg, enjoy retirement. Jim, I had a question on Missiles and Fire Control. I feel like the last few years, you\u2019ve had -- production programs have been down, but you mentioned this resurgence in the PAC-3. And U.S.A., it seemed like the guys were pretty positive on a range of production programs, HIMARS, for instance, being one of them because of what we\u2019ve seen in the papers. But if we think about the midterm at Missiles and Fire Control with this kind of resurgence in the production programs, is there a margin opportunity there now that you guys are seeing, whereas maybe the production programs kind of start to shift back versus some of the hypersonic development projects?\nJim Taiclet: So, Pete, I\u2019d say, yes, the legacy but still extremely effective MFC programs are fairly high margin because of the volume and the learning curve that were already down. So that will be a margin upside to us, should those volumes increase further. And we\u2019ve gotten ahead of this. So, for HIMARS, GMLRS, Javelin, again, the products you kind of see in the news these days and a few others as well. About 6, 7 months ago when we saw what was beginning to happen in Eastern Europe, I went over to visit some of the senior officials in the Pentagon and basically took them a letter and said, we\u2019re going to start spending on capacity for a few of these systems, including the ones you just asked about. And now we\u2019ve got a lot done already. So for example, on HIMARS specifically, we\u2019ve already met with our long lead supply chain to plan for increasing production in 96 of these units a year. We advanced funded ahead of contract $65 million to shorten the manufacturing lead time. That was without a contract or any other even memo or whatnot back from the government. We just went ahead and did that because we expected it to happen. So, those parts are already being manufactured now. The third thing we did was we\u2019ve determined where we could open up another modern manufacturing facility to be able to produce the products and got it ready early, and we\u2019re cross-training our skilled workforce across a bunch of product lines. So, as the demand grows and shifts across some of these products over the next few years, we\u2019re going to have people that kind of fungibly move between them. And then, the last thing we did was going back to this One LMX, we\u2019re putting the best and newest manufacturing technology into some of these product lines first so that when the ramp comes, we can pivot to it quicker. So, those are some of the things that we\u2019ve done to actually capture some of the volume we expect to get. And we do expect to get it, both from the U.S. to refill stocks, as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, and also significant interest being shown. Now, it\u2019s got to go ahead and get contracted, which as we discussed last call, it can take a couple of years to get all that done, especially for an FMS contract. But we know it\u2019s -- the demand is there, and we\u2019ve spoken to the senior government officials from those countries that know that this is important for them.\nJay Malave: Just -- Pete, just to follow up on that. We do expect some sales upside there on some of these programs that Jim mentioned. That is likely to be in -- probably starting in the 2020 time frame given the long cycle nature of where we are in spite of the fact that we\u2019ve done some advanced funding. The other thing I just have to also mention is that where we see the margin pressure next year, a lot of that is driven at MFC. And so, while we will see a mix benefit associated from these higher-margin programs, that is probably more in 2024 and beyond. 2023, we\u2019ll see a step down from where they are this year in 2022. And the way to think about it is, in the third quarter, MFC did about 13.5. What\u2019s implied in our guide for the fourth quarter is high-13s. They\u2019re going to be in that mid-13 range, in that ballpark, for 2023 given some of these new increases in the programs that we\u2019ve invested in. And so, we\u2019ll see a little bit of pressure there across the company, really driven by MFC. But again, we\u2019ll see some of those mix benefits come back to us in \u201824 and beyond.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. And best of luck, Greg. Thank you. And good morning, Jim and Jay. Jay, one for you maybe, I want to ask about the share repurchase authorization increase in the dividend raise. Can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about deployment as a percentage of free cash flow going forward? And what were some of the assumptions made around the R&D tax credit perhaps in the expected use of debt? And just maybe adjacent to that, as you think about market multiples coming down and some of these smaller companies needing to potentially prime -- pair up with prime, how do you think about taking advantage of that opportunity along with the share repurchase authorization? Thank you.\nJay Malave: Okay. There\u2019s a lot there. So, let me maybe start with the share repurchase. As I mentioned -- both Jim and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we\u2019re confident in the long-term outlook of the Company. We saw this as an opportunity to really amplify the value creation that we see over the long term. And we saw no better time than really now to get started on that here in the fourth quarter. The profile to think about going forward is $4 billion here in the fourth quarter, $4 billion in 2023, $4 billion in 2024 and maybe $2 billion in 2025 as a starting point. And so, that\u2019s the profile we should expect it to be. As far as debt, we do -- are going to finance this fourth quarter share repurchase program with the issuance of debt. So, it will be about $4 billion. That will increase our interest expense next year. But again, it\u2019s all accretive. And so, we\u2019ll see that. Again, our debt leverage ratio on an EBITDA basis will put us still below -- at or below 1.5 times. So, it\u2019s still very supportable and also very attractive. As far as the R&D tax capitalization, really nothing\u2019s changed at the moment. We\u2019ll see what happens as we move forward here in the fourth quarter. First things first, we got to get through the November elections. And then we have the expiration of the existing continuing resolution on December 16th. It\u2019s possible through legislation, therefore, a new budget that we could see movement on tax extenders that would include some type of either deferral or what we would prefer a repeal of the task capitalization policy. And as you know, we believe that it\u2019s sound policy, and we believe there\u2019s bipartisan support to remove any disincentives that promote innovation. And so, that\u2019s a firm policy. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re firmly behind and we\u2019ll continue to push for.\nJim Taiclet: Sheila, when it comes to small and midsized companies teaming up with Lockheed Martin, we\u2019re set up for that. I can describe three ways in which we are ready now to pair up and team up with whether they\u2019re commercial or defense, industrial-based companies of smaller scale. One is that we\u2019ve had for years, LM Ventures, like literally a VC house inside of Lockheed Martin. It\u2019s been funded at $200 million level originally. The investments that have been made under that authorization are now worth about $400 million. So even if we mark to market a little bit lower, we had basically 100% return on that initial investment. Seeing the success when I joined the company of the LM Ventures program a couple of years ago, we went ahead doubled the authorization. So, we\u2019re looking where to invest another $200 million in early-stage companies. At the next level, I motivated the team, and Jay helped us create what we can now call Lockheed Martin Evolve or LM Evolve, E-V-O-L-V-E. And what that\u2019s meant to do is to go at a step higher and say, how do we do joint ventures or commercial alliances with midsized companies, co-invest, et cetera, whether again, there on the commercial side or the defense industrial base side or space industry in ways that we can take that outside of our rate structure and manage it and fund it in a different, more creative way? So, we\u2019re in the VC space with LM Ventures. We\u2019re in the midsized page -- space with LM Evolve, which is just literally getting off the ground, I\u2019ll say. But we have the framework, the structure and the ability to engage in that level of investment now. And then thirdly, something we\u2019ve done over the years is acquire small and medium companies with technologies or critical supply chain components that are available. So, we\u2019ll continue to do that as well. So, those are the three routes that we have in place up and running: LM Ventures, LM Evolve and the acquisition process to bring those kind of capabilities into -- or an affiliation with Lockheed Martin.\nOperator: And next, we\u2019ll go to Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Spingarn: Best of luck, Greg. Jim, I wanted to ask you a high-level question, particularly because you\u2019re a pilot. The Air Force is facing a shortage of pilots, and the Navy is planning to have at least 60% of the carrier air wings uncrewed. And so, given that Lockheed is so strong on manned aircraft, I wanted to ask you about unmanned and the positioning there and how that fits into the long-term plans of both the Air Force and the Navy.\nJim Taiclet: So Rob, autonomy is 1 of the 14 critical technologies that we think are essential in the 21st century. And to everyone\u2019s credit at the company, we\u2019ve been investing in Skunk Works and other parts of the Company, including Sikorsky, in autonomy for 15-plus years, right? This is not an easy thing to do or an easy thing to get approved or regulated. But Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky, when it was part of UTC and thereafter, had been working on autonomy for quite some time. So, the Aeronautics side of it, I can\u2019t say much about because it\u2019s pretty highly classified. But we\u2019re far down the road on crewed, uncrewed teaming. And in the January call, we expect to have hit a couple of milestones in that, that I\u2019ll be able to explain in some more detail, but we want to get the testing done before we talk about it. But we\u2019re far down the road there, mainly out of Skunk Works, as I said. And then, on the rotorcraft side, if you get the Aviation Week from maybe 3 or 4 months ago that showed a Sikorsky helicopter flying around with no people in it, right? I\u2019ve actually flown in the Matrix helicopter, we call it, which is a DARPA project that\u2019s run out of Sikorsky. It has three -- and they all work, by the way. It has three modes. One is manual mode, just like any traditional helicopter. The second mode is sort of assisted like a Tesla, so to speak, right? So, you can take over if you need to or if you want to change the flight instantly. And then, the third mode is fully automated. And it -- you plug the mission in a trailer down or up at Stratford, Connecticut, thing will take off, go do the mission and come back and land on itself. So, it\u2019s really working already. And then, it\u2019s a matter of when is the U.S. government and the service is ready to turn these technologies into programs of record, but we\u2019ll be ready when they are.\nOperator: Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes. Let me join everybody and say thank you, Greg, for a great job done. And Maria, welcome. So, we haven\u2019t talked about inflation. What are you guys seeing and assuming in inflation going forward? And as you know, Bill LaPlante has basically suggested that DoD should kind of kick in to help companies because the current level of inflation was not anticipated where the -- when the contracts were signed. And yet Senator Elizabeth Warren, no big surprise, is saying that\u2019s not a good idea. So what are you seeing in inflation? And what are you assuming going forward in terms of DoD support?\nJay Malave: Sure, Cai. Inflation is twofold: one on our own labor front and then in what we see in supply chain. And for our portfolio of business is a fair amount of our business that\u2019s somewhat insulated because it\u2019s not fixed price. And so, some of the cost-plus benefits that we get, that risk is not held at Lockheed Martin. For the 60% of our business that is fixed price, a lot of our just contracting policies and actions and implementations revolve around going back to back with our supply chain, meaning that whatever duration of time that we commit in our contract with our customer, we have the same commitment to our supply chain to us over that same period of time. And so in many of those cases, we don\u2019t bear that risk either. But it does come into factor as we\u2019re going into new bids and proposals with our customer. We are seeing different changes both on the labor side and in supply chain, and it does have an impact really going forward on bid and proposals. It\u2019s something that we have to keep in front of us. And we\u2019re having dialogues with the customer. As you mentioned, there\u2019s been a little bit of a shift in policy to DoD as far as acceptance of economic price adjustments, and that\u2019s something that we do continue to have dialogue with our customers on. In existing contracts, that\u2019s subject to funding availability, which has been somewhat difficult to actually obtain. But I think going forward, that\u2019s something that certainly would be part of our negotiations and part of our contracting. As far as labor is concerned, we have increased our assumptions in our existing backlog contracts. We\u2019ve been able to absorb that through productivity and other management reserve type of actions. So, we\u2019ve not really seen much of an impact there, but it\u2019s certainly a watch item as we go forward.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: I echo everyone in best to Greg and to Maria. Going to try and sneak two in here real quick. Just on -- Jay, the Wall Street Journal has you this morning saying that growth in 2024 should be low single digits. Is that right? Is that how we should think about it? And then the second one, I wonder if you could help us with the pension outlook for next year, both FAS and CAS. And then just thinking about the CAS outlook beyond 2024 and how that remaining balance kind of trails off in the coming years.\nJay Malave: Sure, Seth. Yes, I think low single digit for 2024 as a baseline is the way you should look at it. We talked on this call today that there are some upside opportunities to that baseline. Missiles and Fire Control is certainly a prime opportunity. Jim talked about opportunities related to HIMARS and other programs. And so, there could be upside from where we are today. These are ongoing dialogues we\u2019re having with our DoD customers. So, it\u2019s hard to really put them into a firm forecast until we get ourselves a clearer picture in terms of what\u2019s going to be under contract and the timing of those deliveries. So, I would say low single-digit baseline is the appropriate level to be. We\u2019re getting better clarity and I think we\u2019ll have a lot more clarity come January, provide our full guidance for 2023 and a better outlook on 2024. As far as pension\u2019s involved, we do expect the FAS income to come down. You\u2019re talking in the range of say $50 million. On the CAS side, we expect the CAS cost to come down as well by about $75 million. So the FAS/CAS adjustment all in, we\u2019re expecting to come down by about $125 million. That\u2019s if we struck things today. As you know, at the end of the year, we\u2019ll have to true up and formally change, but that\u2019s based on what we see today. As far as CAS is involved, we\u2019re going to have to get back to you in \u201824 and beyond in that. Greg will have to come back to you Seth on that.\nOperator: Next question is from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Greg, congratulations, and welcome, Maria. Jim and Jay, thank you for providing color on the specific headwinds in 2023. But maybe taking a step back for a 30,000-foot view, the defense budget environment is pretty robust. We saw the \u201822 budget request up mid-single digit. The Ukraine military aid so far adds another 10% to the \u201822 modernization budget. So, your book-to-bill also year-to-date is 1.1x. I guess I would have thought that these items could have offset the specific 2023 headwinds you called out. So maybe absent the specific programs you mentioned, should we expect the portfolio to grow above the low or in line with the overall DoD budget?\nJim Taiclet: So Kristine, good morning. I would say, first of all, that the defense budget is expected to go above and beyond what the President\u2019s original submission was a few months back in 2023, right? Now, even if that happens, and we do expect it to happen, and I would just point out a couple of programs that probably would benefit from that and that includes C-130 in that and F-35 production. But it hasn\u2019t happened yet, so we\u2019re not putting it into our forecast. And let me just take a minute to step back and really reemphasize what Jay said, in that we don\u2019t have enough real information right now in the -- early in the fourth quarter of the year to even give much more than an estimate of what the trend will be next year. So starting in 2024, we\u2019re going to start doing January guidance that\u2019s formal. We\u2019re not going to do anything ahead of that. And I\u2019ll tell you the three issues that I\u2019ve learned in my couple of years in management here, we just don\u2019t have clarity on. One is the defense budget, which you just raised a minute ago. We don\u2019t know what it\u2019s going to be. In January, we\u2019ll know what the defense budget is going to be. And then along with that, what\u2019s the status of the major orders and contracts that get put into that budget because as you\u2019re again pointing out, what\u2019s the mix of the budget increase going to be as far as what the contracts and orders come from that. And then finally, we don\u2019t necessarily have status of what the supply chain health is going to be, even in 2023 yet because if there\u2019s another COVID spike in the winter like there was last time, we\u2019re going to have effects in our supply chain. So, there\u2019s -- those three issues really makes it, I think, almost impossible to give you really high confidence trending information, which has been a tradition at the company when the defense budget was rising 5% to 10% a year. But that\u2019s not -- and there was no COVID, by the way, but that\u2019s not the situation now. So, we\u2019re going to start next cycle without trying to give you a trend line in October. We\u2019ll give you a solid formal guidance as we can in Jan of 2024 because of all this. Having said that, even on the products that we fully anticipate are going to get increases because there have been actions inside of government to make it happen, I used the analogy last call of the clutch wasn\u2019t engaged yet even on the order process and paperwork that needs to come to us, so we can actually start production. The way I\u2019d characterize it now is that the clutch is engaging but into some lower gears initially, right? So, the process has started. I really give Dr. LaPlante and others a lot of credit, Andrew Hunter in the Air Force, et cetera, the secretaries of the Air Force, Navy and Army departments are all engaged in making this happen. But it does take time to get through, especially on international FMS contracts and commercial sales, too. So for all those reasons, Kristine, it\u2019s really hard for us to estimate what -- at this point in the cycle what programs are really going to benefit. But I\u2019m pretty sure that F-35 and C-130 would be in there. Many of the MFC products, we\u2019ve already talked about. Black Hawk demand internationally especially is ginning up and as well as F-16. So I think there\u2019s a lot of significant areas where the Company can benefit with an additional defense budget increase.\nJay Malave: Yes. And so Kristine, we fully expect, as Jim mentioned, to participate in this industry upside. You\u2019re going to see that in the orders in the backlog. And what we\u2019re talking about here is converting that to sales taking a little bit longer than expected. I think the important thing to remember in terms of 2023 is that in spite of a lower outlook from a sales perspective, even the margin pressure, we\u2019re still delivering the same amount of free cash flow that we told you a year ago. And our free cash flow per share outlook has gotten better because of our share repurchase program.\nOperator: Next question is from Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Yes. Good morning, everyone. Good morning, Jay, Jim. Can you hear me?\nJim Taiclet: Yes, we can. Good morning.\nPeter Arment: Great. Congratulations, Greg. Appreciate all your effort. Hey Jay, just maybe you made -- Jim made a comment about the Aeronautics kind of flat to kind of slightly down in \u201823, but then sustainment becomes a bigger piece of the story as we get into \u201824. Should we be thinking about Aeronautics kind of troughing out in 2023? Is that kind of what you\u2019re implying, or are there other puts and takes that we should be thinking about longer term? Thanks.\nJay Malave: No. Yes, I think so. I think next year, they\u2019re dealing with some of the transition related to the changes in delivery profiles on the F-35 -- the production contract. And again, we\u2019re just catching up some inventory because some of the delivery profile has moved around. Once that abates, that headwind, we\u2019re going to see at least a leveling off on the production side, which will lead the growth for sustainment and growth in classified programs and growth on the F-16 program. And so, I would expect them in \u201824 and beyond to have a nice growth trajectory.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. And I\u2019d also add there, Peter, that we\u2019re starting to get some real traction on our sort of JADO offering, so to speak. And one of them has been mentioned briefly today called Defense of Guam. And that\u2019s the really first well -- highly organized DoD major contract to come out that really drives the capability and not just a product or system. And what it\u2019s meant to do is integrate and this is our whole 5G.MIL approach. Actually, that\u2019s why we won it, I think, is that integrating current command and control systems in use by the various services. So, the Army\u2019s -- happens to be provided by Northrop Grumman, for example. We\u2019re going to fully incorporate that into the solution and work with them to do it. And then, we\u2019re going to bring the Aegis system from Lockheed Martin into that mix and a number of other programs and products from a range of OEMs. We\u2019re going to work together on this for the first time in this way. So, I think this is going to be a real pathfinder for the future. And once this demonstrates that it can be a success and the industry has got to coalesce and help make it happen with us, we, as an industry, will see more of these opportunities in the 2024-plus time frame, too.\nOperator: Next question is from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: A couple of questions. On the Aeronautics area, Lot 16, you\u2019re not supposed to get in Q4. Jay, does that come with added sales that you may be working on now as well? And then, a second question, if you look at the incremental margin on the profit you provided on the F-35 and the $325 million of sales, it\u2019s like 21%. Does that imply that you increased the margin on the F-35 program? And will that help the margin next year, or is it more than offset by the growth in the sustainment?\nJay Malave: Well, on the second question, George, we did have a profit adjustment on the F-35 program and the production program there. So, we will see moving forward a higher recurring margin rate there. As far as Q4 and Lot 16, yes, we do expect that order in the fourth quarter, as Jim mentioned, a little bit over $8 billion. I wouldn\u2019t -- we do expect a ramp-up in sales at aero, including F-35, and that will include F-16. So to answer your question, yes, that will certainly be part of the sales mix here in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Next, we\u2019ll go to Rich Safran with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nRich Safran: Jim, Jay, Greg, Maria, good morning. How are you?\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nRich Safran: So Jim, I heard your opening remarks about uncertainties on the supply chain and all that. And Jay, I\u2019m going to put you a little bit on the spot here. And hopefully, I\u2019ll get you to answer a long-term cash flow outlook question. Because I think last year, you gave a long-term cash flow outlook and even added a year. So, you\u2019ve been talking long term this morning and recognizing there\u2019s not a lot of high confidence here. Do you have enough visibility to give us a long-term cash flow update? And if possible, could you cash that in terms of buybacks and free cash flow per share?\nJay Malave: Well, Rich, so if you think about our free cash flow last year, and I\u2019m going off -- a little bit off recall here, we said $6.1 billion in \u201823. I believe it was $6.2 billion in 2024. I don\u2019t see any reason why we can\u2019t deliver that and continue to deliver that level of free cash flow beyond \u201823 and \u201824. So -- and our free cash flow, again, with the share repurchase program will get better than what we were saying a year ago. Again, just our management focus on working capital, our management focus, discipline in delivering free cash flow is not going to stop after one year. And so, I\u2019m pretty confident that we can continue to deliver the free cash flow that we committed to a year ago. And again, our free cash flow per share, our growth, you\u2019re looking probably in the range of mid-single-digit growth over this period of time.\nGreg Gardner: Hey John, this is Greg. I think we\u2019ve come up to the top of the hour. So with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Sure, Greg. Thanks. I\u2019d like to conclude today by, again, reinforcing what Jay just talked about, our commitment to delivering long-term, attractive and reliable total returns to shareholders, underpinned by our strong cash generation and our robust balance sheet as well as delivering on these 21st century solutions to meet the challenges that our customers are facing in global security right now. And if some of you might have been around when I was at American Tower, we focused completely on free cash flow per share generation. And that got us through 18 years of up and down cycles, the Great Recession and a few other issues that happened along the way. That\u2019s the right metric for this company, too, and that\u2019s why Jay and I are so -- so much emphasizing it today. So, we\u2019re positioning ourselves for anticipated growth inflection in the next few years, investing in innovative technologies for our customers\u2019 missions, as I said, and strong repurchases along the way to amplify the per share value creation as we go. So, thanks again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you on our next earnings call in January. John, that concludes the call. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2022 earnings call as we review our quarterly results, our 2022 full-year outlook, and our preliminary expectations for 2023. But before we begin, I'd like to welcome Maria, who I'm excited to tell you all, has started as our new Vice President of Investor Relations just yesterday. I'd also like to thank Greg, who announced his plan to retire at the end of the year for his more than 37 years of dedicated service at Lockheed Martin, including five terrific years as our Vice President of Investor Relations. It's been a pleasure to work with you, Greg, and we wish you all the best in retirement. I'd also like to note that we continue to await the U.S. Army's selection for its Future Long-Range Assault Aircraft competition, FLRAA, as it is known. We'll modernize the Army's rotorcraft fleet and represent a long-term franchise growth opportunity. We are confident that DEFIANT X is the transformational aircraft that the U.S. Army's going to need to accomplish its complex missions today and well into the future, and we look forward to the Army's announcement. Lockheed Martin had a solid quarter financially with 3% increase in sales from last year's third quarter, and strong operating margins and earnings per share. Our free cash flow was outstanding as we generated $2.7 billion in the quarter. And our backlog grew nearly $5 billion, closing at $140 billion. We remain on track to achieve the full year outlook for all of our financial metrics that we discussed last quarter. In a few minutes, Jay will provide a detailed review of our quarterly results, updated 2022 guidance and trending information. But before he does that, I will provide a framework for our outlook, and discuss our plans for delivering value to customers and shareholders over the next several years. We continue to anticipate growth over the long term, but with the residual pandemic impacts and supply chain challenges continuing, we now expect a return to growth in 2024 with 2023 sales being approximately equal to our 2022 outlook. We are confident in our four pillars to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Importantly, we expect to deliver solid growth and free cash flow per share in 2023 and thereafter through a combination of cost reductions throughout the business, improved working capital management, and an expanded share of purchase program. Our Board of Directors has approved an increase to our share repurchase authorization to $14 billion. You will see in Jay's charts that we're doubling our share repurchase plan outlook for this year, increasing our outlook by $4 billion for a total expectation of $8 billion in 2022. We also announced a 7% dividend increase this quarter. So altogether, we're on track to deliver approximately $11 billion to shareholders in 2022. We are also elevating our commitment to drive long-term growth through strong independent research and development and capital expenditure funding with an expected total of nearly $4 billion in 2023. These investments will support our customers and deliver on our 21st century security vision to accelerate leading edge, commercial digital technologies, and defense of our nation and allies. A key driver of this strategy is our new One LM transformation, or as we call it, One LMX, [ph] a multi-billion-dollar, seven-year company-wide program to transform our end-to-end business processes and systems. One LMX will create a model-based enterprise with a fully integrated digital thread throughout the design, build, and sustained product lifecycle. As part of our ongoing corporate stewardship approach, we are conducting an internal review to identify potential synergies between our four business areas, further cost reduction opportunities, and a general portfolio review with the goal of increasing operating efficiency in anticipation of our future growth. We are confident in long term growth as domestic and international demand for a wide range of our products and services remain strong. We will continue to actively reinvest capital into our business to meet our customers' requirements and drive organic growth, and we'll use our disciplined and dynamic capital allocation process and strong balance sheet to drive attractive total returns for shareholders. Moving on, I'd like to highlight a few key accomplishments from each of our business areas, beginning with an update on our F-35 program. Last month, the Swiss government signed a letter of offer and acceptance for the procurement of 36 F-35As. This milestone completes the government-to-government procurement process that was first announced in June 2021 when the Swiss Federal Council shared its selection of the F-35 for its future fighter. The signing officially makes Switzerland the 15th F-35 customer. Also, in August, we received contractual authorization from the Joint Program Office, enabling us to book a Lot 15 order of over $7.5 billion and recognize revenues and earnings from the second quarter as well as from the third quarter. Our Space team celebrated the successful launch and deployment of the space-based infrared system GEO-6 satellite, the final spacecraft in the SBIRS constellation. SBIRS has been one of our longest running signature programs, providing the Space Force with an integrated system for missile warning, battlespace awareness, and intelligence gathering. We will also continue to support and advance this important mission through our next generation Overhead Persistent Infrared or next gen OPIR program, which will deliver even more advanced and more survivable missile warning capabilities to the country. At Rotary and Mission Systems, the Sikorsky line of business secured an order for 12 SEAHAWK helicopters from the Australian Ministry of Defense. Over the past 40 years, we've delivered over a 1,000 SEAHAWKs to the U.S. and international customers both with more than 50 remaining in backlog. And in Missiles and Fire Control, the State Department approved a potential sale to the United Arab Emirates for two THAAD systems, including 96 interceptors. The UAE currently operates two THAAD batteries, and this opportunity would significantly increase their air and missile defense capabilities, and once finalized, could be worth over $2.2 billion. Turning to budgets, both chambers of Congress have advanced Appropriation bills in support of fiscal year 2023 Department of Defense budgets. We have seen strong bipartisan support for increased defense funding in congressional authorization and appropriation committees. Final legislation approving these funds has yet to be passed, and the federal government is currently operating under a short term continuing resolution for FY23, limiting DOD funding to prior FY 2022 levels. As part of the continuing resolution, Congress did approve additional supplemental spending to support efforts in Ukraine for the defense of their country. The CR added $3 billion in funding for Ukraine Security Assistance Initiatives, a program to provide equipment, weapons, and military support to Ukraine, bringing the total amount appropriated for this effort to $9 billion. In addition, the continuing resolution appropriated $2 billion to replenish U.S. stocks of equipment sent to Ukraine and to increase production of critical munitions with a presidential drawdown authority funding now having been increased to over $14 billion since the beginning of the year. The international community has also increased their focus on global security with nations across the world having announced a planned five-year increase in defense budget funding of approximately $60 billion in total. We continue to have discussions with customers to expand the manufacturing of multiple products and have submitted offers for consideration. While many of these contracting actions remain in the early stages and may take time to be fully implemented, we believe our signature programs and 21st century security technologies have us well positioned to address the challenges presented by a resurgence in global great power competition. Turning to our 21st century security strategy, I'd like to highlight two examples of Lockheed Martin's leadership in deterrence technologies and how our 5G.MIL open architecture can be used to enhance performance and drive effective Joint All-Domain Operations?  During the third quarter, Lockheed Martin and AT&T teamed to transfer UH-60M Black Hawk helicopter flight and performance data from an aircraft at flying in Connecticut to receiving location in Colorado, using both an AT&T 5G private cellular network and Lockheed Martin's 5G.MIL multi-site pilot network. Operational performance was also improved with the efficiencies introduced by this technology, shortening the total processing time of the task by nearly 85%. Also this quarter, Lockheed Martin and Verizon flew 5G enabled drones to capture and securely transfer high speed, real time intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance data from aircraft and flight to geolocate simulated adversarial positions. This demonstration showed the capabilities of our hybrid base station to bridge commercial and military technologies together, providing our service members with enhanced deterrent capabilities and further enabling the mission all the way out to the actual battlefield. With that, I will turn the call over to Jay and join you later to answer your questions. Sure. Ryan, it's Jim here. So, the two biggest pieces of our four pillars of growth are programs of record, and I'll speak to a few of those in a second, and the classified business we have. And both of those are going to ramp up from 2023 to 2024 meaningly we feel. And the biggest piece of all -- again, the programs of record are going to come into 3 or 4 very identifiable areas. One is the F-35 sustainment, right? So with more aircraft out flying, there's going to be more of a overhaul, repair, spare parts support, those kinds of activities, going on. And that's going to continue over a number of years. So F-35 sustainment is a growth area. In MFC, the PAC-3 is resurging. There's interest in various parts of the world, the Middle East, Europe and Asia now, for PAC-3. So the capabilities of that air defense system are really going to be kicking into gear for the Company in the next couple of years, including in 2024. Along with that, similarly, the CH-53K is going to move up the production rate significantly, and there's some additional international interest there. That aircraft can do lift capability that far exceeds any other that's ever been built in history. And it's, I think, going to get even more uptake as time goes on. And the fourth among many of the programs of record that will grow is fleet ballistic missile that the U.S. Navy is essentially going to revamp for the second time the Trident fleet ballistic missile system. And that's a Lockheed Martin franchise that will continue to grow, again starting in 2024. On the classified side, 2023 is helpful, but not really the ramp that will come in 2024. So, between programs of record and classified, you're going to get the bulk of that growth. On F-35, the U.S. government has got to kind of determine what its budget priorities are at the macro level going forward. One of those has been nuclear deterrents. And so, between the bomber program, the ground-based missile recapitalization and the fleet ballistic missile that I just mentioned, there's going to be a significant amount of defense budget proportionately spent on the nuclear revitalization. But also the conventional threats have gotten worse instead of better as we look forward into the next 2 or 3, 4 years, and that's going to be a budget issue for the U.S. government. We've recommended, and I think the services would support, a steady production rate of 156 aircraft starting again in the 2024 time frame when we can get back up to that based on the COVID recovery for our supply chain. And I think that's supportable. And it takes about 80 U.S. aircraft to make that happen per year with another 75 or so coming from international. We see the international demand -- and it's going to be up to the U.S. government to try to support that 80 number between the congressional committee processes for authorization and appropriation along with the President's budgets going forward. So, we hope for that. We expect it because that's the need, and that's where we think the F-35 program is going to go. But again, in FY23, we won't have that full ramp-up yet. Matt, it's Jim. The only thing we could say about the schedule for FLRAA decision is what the U.S. government puts out publicly. So, we don't have anything else to add to that. It's their schedule and time line, and we think we've put in a terrific offer. And also having been around some of these helicopter pilots in my Air Force time, they actually scared the heck out of me a couple of times when I flew with them. They want to be low. They want to be maneuverable below the tree line. And I've seen the FARA and FLRAA fly. They can do it. There's a video you can look at on YouTube that shows you how amazing this helicopter technology is. And it also gets you up to like a 230- to 250-knot forward speed when you need it. So, it gives the best of both worlds if you're in the rotorcraft business as a flyer. You get good forward speed that's faster than it's ever been for a traditionally designed helicopter because of our counter-rotating rotors. And it also gives you the maneuverability even better than many of the traditional helicopters could have provided. So, we think it's the best solution for the actual frontline Army or other service pilot, and it's going to be up the U.S. government to see where they come out on that. But the schedule is theirs, and we can't really comment on it. So, Pete, I'd say, yes, the legacy but still extremely effective MFC programs are fairly high margin because of the volume and the learning curve that were already down. So that will be a margin upside to us, should those volumes increase further. And we've gotten ahead of this. So, for HIMARS, GMLRS, Javelin, again, the products you kind of see in the news these days and a few others as well. About 6, 7 months ago when we saw what was beginning to happen in Eastern Europe, I went over to visit some of the senior officials in the Pentagon and basically took them a letter and said, we're going to start spending on capacity for a few of these systems, including the ones you just asked about. And now we've got a lot done already. So for example, on HIMARS specifically, we've already met with our long lead supply chain to plan for increasing production in 96 of these units a year. We advanced funded ahead of contract $65 million to shorten the manufacturing lead time. That was without a contract or any other even memo or whatnot back from the government. We just went ahead and did that because we expected it to happen. So, those parts are already being manufactured now. The third thing we did was we've determined where we could open up another modern manufacturing facility to be able to produce the products and got it ready early, and we're cross-training our skilled workforce across a bunch of product lines. So, as the demand grows and shifts across some of these products over the next few years, we're going to have people that kind of fungibly move between them. And then, the last thing we did was going back to this One LMX, we're putting the best and newest manufacturing technology into some of these product lines first so that when the ramp comes, we can pivot to it quicker. So, those are some of the things that we've done to actually capture some of the volume we expect to get. And we do expect to get it, both from the U.S. to refill stocks, as I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, and also significant interest being shown. Now, it's got to go ahead and get contracted, which as we discussed last call, it can take a couple of years to get all that done, especially for an FMS contract. But we know it's -- the demand is there, and we've spoken to the senior government officials from those countries that know that this is important for them. Sheila, when it comes to small and midsized companies teaming up with Lockheed Martin, we're set up for that. I can describe three ways in which we are ready now to pair up and team up with whether they're commercial or defense, industrial-based companies of smaller scale. One is that we've had for years, LM Ventures, like literally a VC house inside of Lockheed Martin. It's been funded at $200 million level originally. The investments that have been made under that authorization are now worth about $400 million. So even if we mark to market a little bit lower, we had basically 100% return on that initial investment. Seeing the success when I joined the company of the LM Ventures program a couple of years ago, we went ahead doubled the authorization. So, we're looking where to invest another $200 million in early-stage companies. At the next level, I motivated the team, and Jay helped us create what we can now call Lockheed Martin Evolve or LM Evolve, E-V-O-L-V-E. And what that's meant to do is to go at a step higher and say, how do we do joint ventures or commercial alliances with midsized companies, co-invest, et cetera, whether again, there on the commercial side or the defense industrial base side or space industry in ways that we can take that outside of our rate structure and manage it and fund it in a different, more creative way? So, we're in the VC space with LM Ventures. We're in the midsized page -- space with LM Evolve, which is just literally getting off the ground, I'll say. But we have the framework, the structure and the ability to engage in that level of investment now. And then thirdly, something we've done over the years is acquire small and medium companies with technologies or critical supply chain components that are available. So, we'll continue to do that as well. So, those are the three routes that we have in place up and running: LM Ventures, LM Evolve and the acquisition process to bring those kind of capabilities into -- or an affiliation with Lockheed Martin. So Rob, autonomy is 1 of the 14 critical technologies that we think are essential in the 21st century. And to everyone's credit at the company, we've been investing in Skunk Works and other parts of the Company, including Sikorsky, in autonomy for 15-plus years, right? This is not an easy thing to do or an easy thing to get approved or regulated. But Lockheed Martin and Sikorsky, when it was part of UTC and thereafter, had been working on autonomy for quite some time. So, the Aeronautics side of it, I can't say much about because it's pretty highly classified. But we're far down the road on crewed, uncrewed teaming. And in the January call, we expect to have hit a couple of milestones in that, that I'll be able to explain in some more detail, but we want to get the testing done before we talk about it. But we're far down the road there, mainly out of Skunk Works, as I said. And then, on the rotorcraft side, if you get the Aviation Week from maybe 3 or 4 months ago that showed a Sikorsky helicopter flying around with no people in it, right? I've actually flown in the Matrix helicopter, we call it, which is a DARPA project that's run out of Sikorsky. It has three -- and they all work, by the way. It has three modes. One is manual mode, just like any traditional helicopter. The second mode is sort of assisted like a Tesla, so to speak, right? So, you can take over if you need to or if you want to change the flight instantly. And then, the third mode is fully automated. And it -- you plug the mission in a trailer down or up at Stratford, Connecticut, thing will take off, go do the mission and come back and land on itself. So, it's really working already. And then, it's a matter of when is the U.S. government and the service is ready to turn these technologies into programs of record, but we'll be ready when they are. So Kristine, good morning. I would say, first of all, that the defense budget is expected to go above and beyond what the President's original submission was a few months back in 2023, right? Now, even if that happens, and we do expect it to happen, and I would just point out a couple of programs that probably would benefit from that and that includes C-130 in that and F-35 production. But it hasn't happened yet, so we're not putting it into our forecast. And let me just take a minute to step back and really reemphasize what Jay said, in that we don't have enough real information right now in the -- early in the fourth quarter of the year to even give much more than an estimate of what the trend will be next year. So starting in 2024, we're going to start doing January guidance that's formal. We're not going to do anything ahead of that. And I'll tell you the three issues that I've learned in my couple of years in management here, we just don't have clarity on. One is the defense budget, which you just raised a minute ago. We don't know what it's going to be. In January, we'll know what the defense budget is going to be. And then along with that, what's the status of the major orders and contracts that get put into that budget because as you're again pointing out, what's the mix of the budget increase going to be as far as what the contracts and orders come from that. And then finally, we don't necessarily have status of what the supply chain health is going to be, even in 2023 yet because if there's another COVID spike in the winter like there was last time, we're going to have effects in our supply chain. So, there's -- those three issues really makes it, I think, almost impossible to give you really high confidence trending information, which has been a tradition at the company when the defense budget was rising 5% to 10% a year. But that's not -- and there was no COVID, by the way, but that's not the situation now. So, we're going to start next cycle without trying to give you a trend line in October. We'll give you a solid formal guidance as we can in Jan of 2024 because of all this. Having said that, even on the products that we fully anticipate are going to get increases because there have been actions inside of government to make it happen, I used the analogy last call of the clutch wasn't engaged yet even on the order process and paperwork that needs to come to us, so we can actually start production. The way I'd characterize it now is that the clutch is engaging but into some lower gears initially, right? So, the process has started. I really give Dr. LaPlante and others a lot of credit, Andrew Hunter in the Air Force, et cetera, the secretaries of the Air Force, Navy and Army departments are all engaged in making this happen. But it does take time to get through, especially on international FMS contracts and commercial sales, too. So for all those reasons, Kristine, it's really hard for us to estimate what -- at this point in the cycle what programs are really going to benefit. But I'm pretty sure that F-35 and C-130 would be in there. Many of the MFC products, we've already talked about. Black Hawk demand internationally especially is ginning up and as well as F-16. So I think there's a lot of significant areas where the Company can benefit with an additional defense budget increase. Yes, we can. Good morning. Yes. And I'd also add there, Peter, that we're starting to get some real traction on our sort of JADO offering, so to speak. And one of them has been mentioned briefly today called Defense of Guam. And that's the really first well -- highly organized DoD major contract to come out that really drives the capability and not just a product or system. And what it's meant to do is integrate and this is our whole 5G.MIL approach. Actually, that's why we won it, I think, is that integrating current command and control systems in use by the various services. So, the Army's -- happens to be provided by Northrop Grumman, for example. We're going to fully incorporate that into the solution and work with them to do it. And then, we're going to bring the Aegis system from Lockheed Martin into that mix and a number of other programs and products from a range of OEMs. We're going to work together on this for the first time in this way. So, I think this is going to be a real pathfinder for the future. And once this demonstrates that it can be a success and the industry has got to coalesce and help make it happen with us, we, as an industry, will see more of these opportunities in the 2024-plus time frame, too. Good morning. Sure, Greg. Thanks. I'd like to conclude today by, again, reinforcing what Jay just talked about, our commitment to delivering long-term, attractive and reliable total returns to shareholders, underpinned by our strong cash generation and our robust balance sheet as well as delivering on these 21st century solutions to meet the challenges that our customers are facing in global security right now. And if some of you might have been around when I was at American Tower, we focused completely on free cash flow per share generation. And that got us through 18 years of up and down cycles, the Great Recession and a few other issues that happened along the way. That's the right metric for this company, too, and that's why Jay and I are so -- so much emphasizing it today. So, we're positioning ourselves for anticipated growth inflection in the next few years, investing in innovative technologies for our customers' missions, as I said, and strong repurchases along the way to amplify the per share value creation as we go. So, thanks again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you on our next earnings call in January. John, that concludes the call. Thanks, everybody."

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thanks Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results, business area detail, provide an update to our 2022 outlook as well as offer some thoughts on 2023 and beyond. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated third quarter financials. Lockheed Martin delivered solid results for the quarter. To start, we generated sequential sales growth of 7% to $16.6 billion, as anticipated. Segment operating profit was $1.9 billion at an 11.2% margin with earnings per share of $6.71, reflecting solid underlying performance that absorbed $0.16 of mark to market headwinds. We also increased backlog with a 1.3 book-to-bill ratio, driven by the F-35 production Lot 15 contract action. Free cash flow was strong in the quarter at $2.7 billion, further enabling the execution of our disciplined and dynamic cash deployment strategy and returning over $2 billion through share purchases and dividends.  Turning to consolidated sales and segment operating profit results on chart 4. Total sales increased 3% from the third quarter of 2021 with growth in three of our four business areas. Segment operating profit was up slightly, as the benefits from higher volume and equity earnings more than offset lower step-ups than last year. Moving to earnings per share on chart 5. On a reported basis, earnings per share were higher by $4.50. Adjusting for last year's pension transfer transaction and mark to market accounting, EPS grew 4%, primarily reflecting the benefits of higher operating profit and the lower share count. All in all, solid results that position us well to meet our full-year commitments.  Moving to cash flow on chart 6, we delivered our strongest quarter of cash flow year-to-date, with strong collections driving $2.7 billion in free cash flow this quarter while maintaining accelerated payments of $1.1 billion to suppliers. Shareholder cash deployment continues to exceed free cash flow year-to-date with 121% of free cash flow deployed through dividends and share repurchases. We have substantially completed our $4 billion -- our original $4 billion 2022 buyback target. As we announced this quarter, we also increased our dividend 7%, now paying an annualized dividend of $12 per share. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on chart 7. Third quarter sales increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher F-35 production volume, including the recognition of $325 million of sales that were deferred from the second quarter associated with the Lot 15 contract action. Increased volume in our classified programs at Skunk Works also contributed to the growth. Operating profit increased 6%, primarily following the sales volume increases on F-35, partially offset by lower margins on classified programs. Moving to Missiles and Fire Control on page 8. Sales increased 2%, driven primarily by increased volume on PAC-3 interceptors. Segment operating profit was down 8% as lower favorable profit adjustments this quarter more than offset the benefit from higher volume. At Rotary and Mission Systems on page 9, sales decreased year-over-year by 5%, driven primarily by lower Black Hawk production volume at Sikorsky. Operating profit decreased 10%, following Sikorsky production volume and lower favorable profit adjustments this quarter on the Black Hawk program. Turning to chart 10 in our Space business area. Sales were up 7%, driven primarily by the continued ramp of the next-generation interceptor program. Operating profit increased 14% following the volume increase, along with higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Okay. Moving to our updated outlook for 2022 on page 11. We are maintaining our guidance from last quarter for sales, earnings per share and free cash flow. With the announcement this morning of a $14 billion repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors, we've increased our forecast for share buybacks to approximately $8 billion for the year, an increase of $4 billion from our prior expectation, reflecting our confidence in the long-term growth outlook and amplifying per share value creation. We expect the EPS benefit from our incremental planned buybacks this year to be offset by the third quarter mark-to-market headwinds and therefore are holding our current EPS guide of $21.55 for the year. Also, while our consolidated outlook did not change, we did have some puts and takes between the business areas, and you can find that detail in our backlog charts. On chart 12, we've laid out our preliminary framework of expectations for 2023. As we've discussed before, we remain confident in sustained growth, driven by four pillars: those are programs of record, classified programs, hypersonics, and new awards. This is supported by the higher backlog through the third quarter and further growth expected by year-end. We do anticipate flattish sales in 2023, however, primarily due to the delayed sales conversion in our programs of record backlog as the expected recovery from COVID and supply chain shortages will be more gradual than previously expected. In our classified businesses, we expect another year of growth in 2023. This growth, along with our contract mix headwinds, will be accompanied by pressure of approximately 20 to 30 basis points in overall company segment operating margin, all compared to our 2022 outlook. We are confident that through cost reduction and business area synergy actions, we can work to limit this downward pressure. Importantly, through management focus and aggressive working capital actions, our expectations for 2023 free cash flow remain unchanged in spite of the top line and margin pressure. Looking forward, we are confident in the Company's prospects for growth and value creation. With our aggressive share buyback plan, we anticipate repurchasing approximately 10% of our shares outstanding over the next several years. And coupled with a sustained free cash flow, we expect to deliver outstanding long-term value to shareholders. Okay. So, let's wrap up on chart 13. Our business area operational and financial performance in the third quarter was solid, and we are increasing our outlook for cash return to shareholders. We continue to invest in innovative solutions, including commercial technologies in support of our customers' important missions and 21st Century Security. Our focus remains on strong cash generation, and combined with our robust balance sheet and discipline and dynamic capital deployment strategy allow us to deliver long-term value to shareholders. Before we open up to Q&A, I would also like to thank Greg Gardner for his 37 years of dedicated service and contributions to the Company. He's been an outstanding partner and resource to all that he has supported. We wish him well in the next phase of his life. Greg will remain with us through the end of the year to transition Maria Ricciardone Lee. Maria brings Investor Relations experience from multiple companies, including UTX where we both worked together. She's an excellent financial executive and thought partner, and I'm excited that she is joining the team. With that, John, let's open up the call for Q&A. Yes. We have some program transitions, Rob. And maybe I'll just maybe go through around some of the business areas to give you a little bit of color there. When you look at aero next year, we expect that to probably be in the range of being down -- flat to down slightly. And that's on the back really of lower production volume on the F-35. We expect that to be done -- even though sales -- or the deliveries will be generally flat. We recorded sales in advance of that with long lead procurement in 2021 and 2022. So, it will be a period of catch-up on sales for aero there. So, that's going to be the biggest driver there, but we'll expect that to abate when we go into 2024. At MFC, we've got some -- just some timing, so program timing, particularly in our sensors business, we expect them to be probably flattish to down slightly as well. And then, we expect some growth -- low-single-digit growth at both RMS and Space. And RMS will just be driven by new programs. And at Space, we have -- our national security business is down, but we've got other programs that are spiking up there. And so, that's generally what's driving it, I'd say, by business area and by segment. So slightly down in a few and slightly up in others, and our balance will be flat. Let me just -- to maybe add a little bit to it as well, Ron. Just to augment, some of the things that we're seeing in 2023, we've got some expected abating headwinds when we go into 2024. Jim mentioned a little bit on supply chain. That's primarily affected our programs of record. And so, those should lift by the time we get to 2024. We also have a few program transitions in 2023 that will also allow for easier comparison when we get into 2024. And so for example, I just mentioned the F-35 where production will be down next year. Those will normalize when we get into 2024, which will allow our sustainment to grow, as Jim mentioned. We'll also see accelerated growth in the F-16 program. As you may recall, that program slipped to the right, but in 2024, we expect that to accelerate. In Space, as Jim mentioned, FBM, there are other programs such as NGI that will continue to grow. And so we've got some things where we're cycling down this -- on 2023 on the SBIRS program and even things like next-gen GEO or OPIR, again, those headwinds will abate as we get into 2024. Similarly, on MFC, Jim mentioned the PAC-3 program. We'll see also continued growth there in the classified programs as well. And then at RMS, as Jim mentioned, also at CH-53K, there's also other radar programs as well as Joint All Domain-type programs like Defense of Guam that will drive some growth in those years. So, all of these areas and these programs are the ones that we have pretty clear visibility to. They do assume obviously that there is abatement to an improvement in supply chain. That's 15 months from now for improvement that we expect to occur. Just -- Pete, just to follow up on that. We do expect some sales upside there on some of these programs that Jim mentioned. That is likely to be in -- probably starting in the 2020 time frame given the long cycle nature of where we are in spite of the fact that we've done some advanced funding. The other thing I just have to also mention is that where we see the margin pressure next year, a lot of that is driven at MFC. And so, while we will see a mix benefit associated from these higher-margin programs, that is probably more in 2024 and beyond. 2023, we'll see a step down from where they are this year in 2022. And the way to think about it is, in the third quarter, MFC did about 13.5. What's implied in our guide for the fourth quarter is high-13s. They're going to be in that mid-13 range, in that ballpark, for 2023 given some of these new increases in the programs that we've invested in. And so, we'll see a little bit of pressure there across the company, really driven by MFC. But again, we'll see some of those mix benefits come back to us in \u201824 and beyond. Okay. There's a lot there. So, let me maybe start with the share repurchase. As I mentioned -- both Jim and I mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're confident in the long-term outlook of the Company. We saw this as an opportunity to really amplify the value creation that we see over the long term. And we saw no better time than really now to get started on that here in the fourth quarter. The profile to think about going forward is $4 billion here in the fourth quarter, $4 billion in 2023, $4 billion in 2024 and maybe $2 billion in 2025 as a starting point. And so, that's the profile we should expect it to be. As far as debt, we do -- are going to finance this fourth quarter share repurchase program with the issuance of debt. So, it will be about $4 billion. That will increase our interest expense next year. But again, it's all accretive. And so, we'll see that. Again, our debt leverage ratio on an EBITDA basis will put us still below -- at or below 1.5 times. So, it's still very supportable and also very attractive. As far as the R&D tax capitalization, really nothing's changed at the moment. We'll see what happens as we move forward here in the fourth quarter. First things first, we got to get through the November elections. And then we have the expiration of the existing continuing resolution on December 16th. It's possible through legislation, therefore, a new budget that we could see movement on tax extenders that would include some type of either deferral or what we would prefer a repeal of the task capitalization policy. And as you know, we believe that it's sound policy, and we believe there's bipartisan support to remove any disincentives that promote innovation. And so, that's a firm policy. It's something that we're firmly behind and we'll continue to push for. Sure, Cai. Inflation is twofold: one on our own labor front and then in what we see in supply chain. And for our portfolio of business is a fair amount of our business that's somewhat insulated because it's not fixed price. And so, some of the cost-plus benefits that we get, that risk is not held at Lockheed Martin. For the 60% of our business that is fixed price, a lot of our just contracting policies and actions and implementations revolve around going back to back with our supply chain, meaning that whatever duration of time that we commit in our contract with our customer, we have the same commitment to our supply chain to us over that same period of time. And so in many of those cases, we don't bear that risk either. But it does come into factor as we're going into new bids and proposals with our customer. We are seeing different changes both on the labor side and in supply chain, and it does have an impact really going forward on bid and proposals. It's something that we have to keep in front of us. And we're having dialogues with the customer. As you mentioned, there's been a little bit of a shift in policy to DoD as far as acceptance of economic price adjustments, and that's something that we do continue to have dialogue with our customers on. In existing contracts, that's subject to funding availability, which has been somewhat difficult to actually obtain. But I think going forward, that's something that certainly would be part of our negotiations and part of our contracting. As far as labor is concerned, we have increased our assumptions in our existing backlog contracts. We've been able to absorb that through productivity and other management reserve type of actions. So, we've not really seen much of an impact there, but it's certainly a watch item as we go forward. Sure, Seth. Yes, I think low single digit for 2024 as a baseline is the way you should look at it. We talked on this call today that there are some upside opportunities to that baseline. Missiles and Fire Control is certainly a prime opportunity. Jim talked about opportunities related to HIMARS and other programs. And so, there could be upside from where we are today. These are ongoing dialogues we're having with our DoD customers. So, it's hard to really put them into a firm forecast until we get ourselves a clearer picture in terms of what's going to be under contract and the timing of those deliveries. So, I would say low single-digit baseline is the appropriate level to be. We're getting better clarity and I think we'll have a lot more clarity come January, provide our full guidance for 2023 and a better outlook on 2024. As far as pension's involved, we do expect the FAS income to come down. You're talking in the range of say $50 million. On the CAS side, we expect the CAS cost to come down as well by about $75 million. So the FAS/CAS adjustment all in, we're expecting to come down by about $125 million. That's if we struck things today. As you know, at the end of the year, we'll have to true up and formally change, but that's based on what we see today. As far as CAS is involved, we're going to have to get back to you in \u201824 and beyond in that. Greg will have to come back to you Seth on that. Yes. And so Kristine, we fully expect, as Jim mentioned, to participate in this industry upside. You're going to see that in the orders in the backlog. And what we're talking about here is converting that to sales taking a little bit longer than expected. I think the important thing to remember in terms of 2023 is that in spite of a lower outlook from a sales perspective, even the margin pressure, we're still delivering the same amount of free cash flow that we told you a year ago. And our free cash flow per share outlook has gotten better because of our share repurchase program. No. Yes, I think so. I think next year, they're dealing with some of the transition related to the changes in delivery profiles on the F-35 -- the production contract. And again, we're just catching up some inventory because some of the delivery profile has moved around. Once that abates, that headwind, we're going to see at least a leveling off on the production side, which will lead the growth for sustainment and growth in classified programs and growth on the F-16 program. And so, I would expect them in \u201824 and beyond to have a nice growth trajectory. Well, on the second question, George, we did have a profit adjustment on the F-35 program and the production program there. So, we will see moving forward a higher recurring margin rate there. As far as Q4 and Lot 16, yes, we do expect that order in the fourth quarter, as Jim mentioned, a little bit over $8 billion. I wouldn't -- we do expect a ramp-up in sales at aero, including F-35, and that will include F-16. So to answer your question, yes, that will certainly be part of the sales mix here in the fourth quarter. Well, Rich, so if you think about our free cash flow last year, and I'm going off -- a little bit off recall here, we said $6.1 billion in \u201823. I believe it was $6.2 billion in 2024. I don't see any reason why we can't deliver that and continue to deliver that level of free cash flow beyond \u201823 and \u201824. So -- and our free cash flow, again, with the share repurchase program will get better than what we were saying a year ago. Again, just our management focus on working capital, our management focus, discipline in delivering free cash flow is not going to stop after one year. And so, I'm pretty confident that we can continue to deliver the free cash flow that we committed to a year ago. And again, our free cash flow per share, our growth, you're looking probably in the range of mid-single-digit growth over this period of time."

These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today's call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks Greg. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2022 earnings call. I will begin today with an update on our F-35 program. Yesterday, we signed a bilateral record of negotiation with the US government, reaching agreement on the Lots 15 through 17 production contract. Through a collaborative effort with the F-35 enterprise, including the Joint Program Office, suppliers, and teammates, we have concurred on the major parameters of the program, addressing inflationary and pandemic-related issues unanticipated at the start of the negotiation process. The agreement supports our long-term objective to produce 156 aircraft a year. However, COVID impacts experienced by the F-35 enterprise have required us to modify our near-term production plan. Deliveries over the next two years are expected to remain in the 147 to 153 range of aircraft, similar to our 2022 plan, before we then achieve our 156 aircraft delivery target in 2025. We continue to anticipate annual deliveries of 156 jets beyond 2025 for the foreseeable future. I'd like to thank the entire team for the dedication and professionalism shown throughout this process and we look forward to delivering these unmatched fifth generation aircrafts for our US Air Force, Navy, and Marines, our partner countries, and our international customers. Moving to our quarterly results. Our business area operational performance was solid, delivering increased profit margins from last year's second quarter. Our new business activity and order flow were also favorable, and we continue to anticipate our backlog ending the year significantly above our 2021 levels, positioning us for longer term growth. Our sales in the quarter were $15.4 billion, lower than we expected due to the delay in contract agreement on the F-35 and supply chain impacts. We anticipate the supply chain challenges to continue for the remainder of the year and we've reduced our 2022 outlook to reflect that as well as some other items, and Jay will cover this in more detail in a few minutes. We also progressed well on our cash deployment plan, delivering over $1.1 billion to stockholders in dividends and repurchases, exceeding 100% of our free cash flow. We will continue to execute on our strategy of driving cash generation, disciplined and dynamic capital deployment, growing free cash flow per share and delivering attractive long-term total returns to you, shareholders. Turning briefly to budgets. Both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees approved their versions of the FY 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. The SASC recommended approximately a $45 billion increase to the President's request and the full House chamber passed the completed authorization bill with a $37 billion increase. While the budget process remains in its early stages, we are encouraged by the support our programs have seen with the Senate recommending additional F-35 and Black Hawk helicopters, increases over the lower-than-expected volumes that were in the initial presence request. Both the Senate markup and the House bill received strong bipartisan supporting committee with recognition of the need for greater investment to respond to increasing global security threats and the imperative of improving the readiness of our armed forces. Congress will continue the next phase of the authorization and appropriations process over the coming weeks and months. And we look forward to its timely finalization. Turning to our 21st Century Security strategy, I'd like to highlight an important example of how our signature platforms can be integrated into effective joint all-domain operations. These efforts are designed to benefit our soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and guardians by continually upgrading their mission capabilities with the latest physical and digital world technologies. This quarter, our Rotary and Mission Systems and Missiles and Fire Control business areas partnered with the US Indo-Pacific Command in Valiant Shield 2022. This is a biannual training activity focused on integrating forces in multiple domains. Valiant Shield 2022 is a cornerstone of INDOPACOM's integrated deterrent strategy to prevent conflict in the region, and it's the largest US joint force exercise in the Western Pacific. We linked our DIAMONDShield battle management system, AEGIS Weapon System, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or HMARS and PAC-3 missiles to successfully demonstrate integrated multi-domain operations of strategic and tactical mission levels across air, land, sea and space. During this 12-day event, our Lockheed Martin team demonstrated all domain capabilities and collaboratively engaged in experiments with INDOPACOM using artificial intelligence to enable rapid decision making in seconds or minutes compared to ours. Technical demonstrations like these are key enablers to our four-pillar growth strategy. And we will continue to demonstrate to our frontline commanders and servicemen and women in many additional exercise and real-world demonstrations to come. Moving to our four-pillar growth areas and staying with the Pacific region, RMS' Aegis Weapon System was selected to be the backbone system for the Missile Defense Agency's Defense of Guam architecture. This is a pathfinder for joint all-domain operations for the DoD and for regional integrated air and missile defense with an expected program value itself of over $1 billion. This architecture will defend against ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missile threats through the integration of capabilities across multiple industry products and not just Lockheed Martin. Aegis and our TPY-X radar, a derivative of our long-range discrimination radar product, will be the core systems to outpace the potential threat and expand JADO capabilities for Guam. This Guam architecture leverages existing Lockheed Martin capabilities such as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD, PAC-3, Sentinel A4 radar and our C2BMC command and control system, highlighting the advantages of our broad portfolio and cross-business area collaboration with Missiles and Fire Control. RMS will also fully integrate future system capabilities, which may include space-based sensors, directed energy and advanced missiles in the Defense of Guam, a critical cornerstone in Western Pacific deterrence. And we'll be using an open architecture where we can tie-in other prime contractors, products and systems along with ours. Staying with RMS, this quarter, the US Marine Corps approved our Sikorsky teams CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, one of our key programs of record for initial operating capability. The IOC declaration validates the operational readiness of the King Stallion to forward deploy Marines across the globe and positions the Marine Corps for a full rate production decision in 2023. The 53K has a plan of record to deliver 200 domestic aircraft and a total program life cycle value expected to be approximately $50 billion. We're also excited this quarter to receive a $2.3 billion award for Sikorsky's 10th Black Hawk multiyear contract to provide 120 H60 helicopters. This contract includes options, which, if exercised, have the potential to deliver an additional 135 rotorcraft with a value of up to another $4.4 billion. Also this quarter, Missiles and Fire Control received a $1.6 billion contract award to produce THAAD interceptors for both domestic and international customers. Under this combined buy award, the THAAD team will provide both the US government and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with additional interceptors in support of integrated air and missile defense. Our MFC business area was also awarded a contract by the Missile Defense Agency to initiate production of the eighth THAAD battery. The eighth battery expands the US government's ability to field the integrated air and missile defenses and builds upon the previously delivered 7 systems, a clear demonstration of the value delivered by the signature program and defending against current and emerging threats and maintaining the turns. Before I turn the call over to Jay, I'd like to express my appreciation for the presidential visit to the Javelin manufacturing facility in Troy, Alabama, supporting the men and women who produce this remarkable product. The Ukraine conflict has been a dramatic reminder that we're in a global power competition. And we at Lockheed Martin stand ready to support our nation and its allies with advanced systems and technologies. The US alone has committed more than 5,500 Javelin missiles to Ukraine in defense of their country. And this visit spotlighted the continued need for a focus on global security and deterrence capabilities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later to answer your questions.\nJay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our consolidated results, business area detail and provide an update to our 2022 outlook. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated second quarter financials. Operating results were largely in line with our expectations for the quarter along with non-operating impacts that we previously had highlighted. We generated sales of $15.4 billion. And as Jim noted, our revenues were affected by the delayed contract agreement for production Lots 15 to 17 on the F-35 program and supply chain impacts. Underlying performance was solid with segment operating profit of $1.7 billion and segment margin expansion of 60 basis points year-over-year to 11%.  Earnings per share were $1.16, including $5.16 in nonoperational charges. And we delivered greater than $1 billion in free cash flow, while returning 107% of that amount to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As noted in the press release, we updated our outlook, which I'll review later in my remarks.  Turning to consolidated sales and segment operating profit results on chart four. Total sales declined 9% due to anticipated program transitions and supply chain impacts across the business areas, in addition to more than $300 million in revenue shortfall from the gap in F-35 funding in advance of our agreement on Lots 15 through 17.  Operating profit declined 4%. And as previously mentioned, segment operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 11%, reflecting another quarter of solid underlying performance, benefits from contract mix, as well as higher net step-ups largely due to the absence of last year's classified program charge in Aeronautics.  Moving to earnings per share on chart five, we've included a reconciliation of our GAAP EPS to an adjusted or operational EPS. First, we've refinanced $2.3 billion of outstanding debt, claiming maturities for the next three years and lowering our near-term exposure to interest rate risk. This impact was $0.10. In addition, we executed our latest pension transfer transaction. And as a reminder, this is our seventh such transaction to reduce long-term risk and volatility of pension trust asset returns. The impact to the quarter was $4.49, including $0.16 of tax timing that will reverse over the balance of the year.  Lastly, volatile capital markets have significantly impacted asset returns and our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund and other plans. Despite the short-term volatility, our Ventures fund has delivered significant financial returns over the long term, but more importantly, has infused Lockheed Martin with emerging technologies to benefit our core business. Adjusted for these nonoperating items, our second quarter earnings per share would have been $6.32 and even higher had the F-35 funding constraint been lifted.  Moving to cash flow on chart six. As you've come to expect, we delivered solid free cash flow in the quarter and accelerated payments of $1 billion to suppliers. Once again, cash deployed to shareholders exceeded free cash flow in the quarter and for the first half of 2022, we have returned 178% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases.  Okay, moving over to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on chart seven. Second quarter revenue decreased approximately $800 million from last year. F-35 sales were down over $900 million due to supply chain impacts, the impact of the Lot 15 through 17 unrecognized sales and sustainment award timing. This was partially offset by strength in our classified area, which increased by more than $200 million this quarter, a 50% increase from the second quarter of 2021. Segment operating margin for Aero increased 180 basis points primarily due to the absence of last year's loss recorded on a large classified program.  Moving to Missiles and Fire Control on page eight. Sales were lower by approximately $200 million, including the expected reduction in sustainment following the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, as well as lower volume in multiple missile programs. Strong performance in tactical and strike missiles and in the missile defense PAC-3 program, as well as favorable program mix drove a 160 basis points increase in segment operating margin. At Rotary and Mission Systems on page nine, lower Black Hawk and presidential helicopter volume, along with supply chain impacts across the business area, lowered year-over-year sales by approximately $200 million. Operating profit was lower based on fewer favorable profit adjustments on Aegis and Radar programs, the impact from lower volume and changes in contract mix. Turning to chart 10 in our Space business area. Overall sales were down $350 million by a $425 -- or driven by a $425 million reduction from the renationalization of the atomic weapons establishment, which is partially offset by solid growth on a next-generation interceptor program. This will be the last quarter we'll be affected by the AWE compare. Operating profit was lower primarily due to the mix and timing of launches at United Launch Alliance as well as lower profit step-ups. Okay. Moving over to our updated outlook on page 11. Our expectations for segment operating profit and free cash flow remain unchanged despite a lower sales outlook, reflecting solid year-to-date results and management's focus on operating performance. Our expectation for full year sales have been by $750 million to approximately $65.25 billion. Three of our four business areas have been reduced due to supply chain impacts, award timing and program schedule shifts, all of which are incorporated into our new guidance. The impact of lower anticipated sales volume is expected to be offset by improved margins for the year, which is supported by our year-to-date margin performance. We are lowering the earnings per share outlook by $5.15 to reflect the impact of one-time items, such as the pension transfer, debt refinancing and year-to-date mark-to-market adjustments. It's important to note that these expectations assume that we definitize the Lot 15 through 17 contract here in the third quarter. In addition, there are no incremental mark-to-market impacts assumed for the second half of the year. Okay. Moving to Chart 12. We provided a detailed view of the changes to earnings per share for the year. The one-time pension settlement charge is now included in our outlook. And following the execution of that pension transfer, the remeasurement of our pension plans has caused us to reduce our FAS/CAS pension adjustment by $50 million. We've also incorporated the impacts of the year-to-date mark-to-market adjustments and our debt refinanced to the new estimate of approximately $21.55. On chart 13, you'll see the changes to guidance by business area. As I mentioned before, three of our four business areas have reduced sales outlooks, reflecting supply chain impact and award timing. But as noted, each business area is holding to the previous guidance for segment operating profit. We're confident that we can deliver higher operating margins, offsetting the top line headwinds with our continued focus on cost reduction, program performance and leveraging the size and scale of the enterprise. Okay. Let's wrap up on chart 14. Our operational performance in the second quarter was solid, with improved segment margins and consistent cash generation and deployment. We revised our 2022 financial outlook, incorporating headwinds, but held our commitments for segment operating profit, free cash flow and cash deployment. Now looking beyond 2022, the Lockheed Martin fundamentals remain strong. We continue to invest in support of our customers' important security missions, leveraging the breadth of our platforms and solutions. Our broad portfolio as well as the current and projected backlog underpin our future growth expectations. In addition, the outlook for domestic and international defense spending has improved and we expect to incorporate these changes over the coming months as we gain clarity on the timing of global security spending commitments and industry fulfillment. To close, our pillars of growth, financial position, focus on strong cash generation, and our disciplined and dynamic capital deployment strategy places us in an enviable position to deliver long-term value to shareholders. With that, Brad, let's open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Of course. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDoug Harned: Yes. Good morning. Thank you. I wanted to make sure to have a good understanding of where the F-35 stands here, and you've guided to 147 to 153 per year in the next two years and then 156 in 2025. But the Block 15 to 17 size averages it down at 125 and we assume that starts in mid-2023 in terms of deliveries. So, really two questions here. First, can you reconcile the lower block size with your production plan and also with the 2023 budget levels, which suggests some lower deliveries, at least to us, in 2025? And then second, why did DoD go to these lower block sizes? And does that have any implications for how you think about margins in these blocks?\nJay Malave: Let me walk you through the reconciling item here on your first question, Doug. So, first, when we ended the second quarter, our backlog was 169 aircraft. If you assume, say, the midpoint of 2022 of our guide, let's say, 150 aircraft that says that we would be delivering about another 89 aircraft in the back half of the year. That would take our backlog down to 80 aircraft. With the 375, that puts us at 455. So, if you assume again at the midpoint for 2023 and 2024 of about 100 aircraft -- 150 aircraft, that puts you at 300. That leaves about 155 for 2025. And so maybe one short to the 156 in 2025, but pretty much right there. As far as the lower outlook, a lot of that was incorporated in our negotiation on Lot 15 to 17 in terms of the factors, we've talked about before as far as impacts from COVID, impacts in supply chain, also lower volumes and other factors. And all of that was taken into consideration in the negotiation with the Joint Program Office. The margins themselves at the end of the day, the way the contract is structured as we finalize this is there will be some level of fixed price to it and some level of incentive to it. So, we're incentivized to perform and provide delivery, to provide delivery as well as quality targets to the customer. If we can perform to our expectation in those improvements, then we wouldn't see any type of dilution to our margins today. And we're confident we can perform to those levels.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nRichard Safran: Jim, Jay, Greg good morning. How are you?\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nRichard Safran: Jay, if I could, let me follow up on something you said in your closing remarks here. Actually, I have to think that your international outlook has changed quite a bit in just the past few months. I recognize you're in various stages of negotiations, but could you discuss where you're seeing the most demand come from, for what types of equipment? And importantly, would you be willing to discuss a bit on how this might affect your outlook for 2023? And your answer, maybe you could also just address if you think there could be a trend towards more commercial contracting as a result of what's going on? Thanks.\nJay Malave: Sure, Richard. Yeah, let me get started on that. I think the takeaway here in the closing remarks is that -- as I mentioned, the environment has improved from where it was a year ago. And along with that, our pipeline has certainly grown. And I'll throw maybe a couple of examples to that. We've seen, I think, in the press in terms of higher demand, and we've seen new contracts on the F-35. There's also interest on the F-16 with international partners and customers. And we've talked about we've got a backlog today of 128 aircraft. We're pleased to have Germany coming to the fold -- or I'm sorry, Jordan come into the fold as well. But beyond that we've talked about a pipeline 300 to 400 additional aircraft. That pipeline has grown to about 500 aircraft, given what we've seen over the past six months, six to 12 months. And so in our Aero, in these aircraft, we see incremental opportunities. I'd say similarly in our Missiles and Fire Control, both on the air and missile defense side as well as tactical missile side, we've seen inquiries on foreign military sales. And that pipeline has grown as well, and that's in, say, the multibillion dollars of opportunity. Things like -- things that have been out there in the press, whether it's Javelin, HIMARS as well as PAC-3 opportunities. It's important to remember that in the PAC-3 we are increasing our outlook and our production schedules to begin with. And so the question is how much higher can we take it over the next number of years. As this correlates and I mentioned in my remark that we\u2019ll gain more clarity in terms of how these things will actually manifest themselves into real contracts. The reality is today, none of it is under contract. And so we're trying to get a better understanding what the timing, of which these will come into contract and then getting a better understanding of our supply chain capability to determine when we can actually deliver. But I can say with some level of reasonable confidence is that our orders and backlog outlook over the next two years will be better than it was a year ago. But that will still take some time to convert to revenues beyond that time period.\nJim Taiclet: Yeah. And just to add to that, in response to your question there, Richard, is look, the DoD is in the midst of changing gears and so are our allies, right? So at the beginning of 2022, the administration was still in the midst of a relatively benign global security environment at least relative to now. The US has largely withdrawn from its military operations after two decades of heavy presence in the Middle East. China's increasing activism in the Western Pacific, while recognized was perceived as kind of a potential concern, a watch item for the future, if you will. Europe was totally at peace, and Russian forces remained within their borders at that point in time. But if you fast forward to today, the US and its allies are actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Pacific is on higher alert because of the statements and actions of China recently, not to mention North Korea. The value of deterrence has never been greater really at this point now. And that shift happened over literally three or four months. What that requires is the Department of Defense to shift gears, okay? And I can tell you the clutch isn't engaged yet. And the clutch engaged means there are contracts in place. There's a demand signal out there that's clear. There's funding appropriated by the US Congress in the case of the United States. And we're producing, as Jay said, with a supply chain that's robust enough to support it. To get the clutch to engage is going to take two to three years. And that's for our allies as well because they not only have to go through their own processes internally. They then have to go through generally the foreign military sales process. And for the kinds of systems that Jay outlined, the US government is probably going to continue to insist that we mostly use the FMS process to contract with foreign -- through them to foreign governments for these kinds of equipments like F-35 and F-16 and HIMARS, et cetera. So we actually have a match to our original strategy, which was for the next couple of years, we were expecting relatively flat defense budgets in the US, not a lot of concern out in the allies. That's all changed. But we're aiming for the company and for the share count to be ready for an inflection point now again, in 2024 and beyond, the middle of the decade. This unfortunate situation in global security having deteriorated can only bolster our inflection point from where it would have been. And along with that, we're doing the integration of our signature platforms that everybody seems to want right now into that 21st Century Security fabric, which will make them, we think, even more attractive. And then we'll bring in our counterparts along onto that open architecture going forward. So I do think that it's going to take a while for the clutch to engage here, both in the US and internationally. But the demand in the situation that our customer base is facing has dramatically changed over the last three, four months.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks. Good morning.\nJay Malave: Jay, I wanted to ask about the pension. So I saw you mark-to-market with the pension transfer. So $50 million worse this year, but what does that mean for -- based on where things are today, given big time negative asset returns, what are you thinking about for pension in the next couple of years relative to what you guided for prior? I think it was $2.3 billion in pension income in 2023 and $2 billion in 2024. Thanks.\nJay Malave: Yes. Good question, David. This year, excluding the impact of the one-ime charges, we're $2.2 billion for the total FAS/CAS adjustment. I'll break it down. On the FAS side, interestingly, is you're right, David. The assets -- not only did we lose $4.3 billion worth of assets with the pension transfer, but the returns are lower, too. And so that will impact our returns next year. But that is essentially entirely offset by lower amortized losses associated with the pension transfer that we just took. So I would expect our pension, our total adjustment in our FAS is going to be flat. So about 400 \u2013 in 400 and change this year to be about 400 and change next year. Similarly, on CAS, we're seeing similar types of effects where next year, the CAS costs will be similar to what it was this year. That is higher than what we are anticipating it to be coming into this year for 2023. So, we'll have to evaluate whether that has any impact on the backlog of our contract, but when you look at it year-over-year, it's essentially flat. Going beyond that, we'll have to kind of update you, I think, in our October call and we give the trending data. But I can say right now for '23, essentially flat.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Thanks so much and good ops. Jay, could you maybe update us? You mentioned supply chain issues, and you mentioned the issue in the F-16, which I guess you kind of preannounced that, that might be an issue, kind of where are you with both supply chain? What are the problems? Where are they and similarly with labor availability? Thank you.\nJay Malave: Yes. Good question, Cai. Going back in the beginning of the year, everyone was impacted by the latest variant that we had. And our operations were impacted, our supply chain operations were impact \u2013 and I think our ability to recover from that has been more challenging than we originally anticipated. We have seen some level of improvement in certain areas of not only our operations, but also our supplier operations. But we've also seen broken commitments at the same time. And so, it just caused us to reassess what this meant for the year.  And so, while we do see some improvement, our ability to recover the lost time in the beginning of the year has just become too much of a challenge. And that's really the question when you go beyond '22 now, is how -- does that ripple through? As you see -- Jim mentioned, the COVID impacts on the 135 as an example, we're seeing that ripple through, through multiple years. And so that's something that we just have to continue to evaluate and take a look at what that means to '23 and beyond.  As far as labor, labor has been an ongoing challenge, I think, for the industry as well as us. I think we've -- given the size and the scale of Lockheed Martin, I think that we've been able to weather it reasonably well. And as an example, on F-16, we've been able to take close to 50 employees out of a different operation, an international operation and bring it into Greenville, South Carolina to help us stand up and move quicker on the F-16 program. So, it just goes to the strength and the breadth that we have here at Lockheed Martin.  But nonetheless, it's been a challenge. Our ramp on that program is taking longer than we had originally anticipated largely because of the slower ramp in hiring employees. We're pretty laser-focused on it. We have a dedicated team -- HR team that is focused on hiring people. They are very focused on a particular radius to bring those people in, and I think we're on a good track now with our new schedule. We expect to deliver aircraft next year, and then we'll get to a more strong -- more of a run rate -- full capacity run rate for Greenville in 2024.  So hopefully, that answers all your questions, Cai. But again, it's been \u2013 again, supply chain has been choppy for the year. The reason why we took it -- took the expectation down is, we expect it to continue to be choppy for the remainder of the year. And we'll have to reassess it when we give our training data in terms of what it means for 2023 and beyond.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Greg Konrad with Jefferies. Please, go ahead.\nGreg Konrad: Good morning.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nGreg Konrad: I was hoping maybe just to talk a little bit about Sikorsky and how you're thinking about the outlook there, given you've had some incremental CH-53Ks and finalization of the Multi-Year X for Black Hawk. When does that business return to growth? And then with that, any update on FLRAA and kind of how you're thinking about award timing there?\nJay Malave: So on Sikorsky, we expect to return to growth really starting in 2023 for that business. We're expecting, as you mentioned, the FLRAA decision, which we've been told which should be coming in September. We believe that we are the best choice for that platform, and that is a pillar of our growth. If you may recall, both John Mollard and Jim Taiclet had talked about the four pillars of growth, and one of those being new awards, FLRAA was one of those programs that we have talked about. And so, we expect to see incremental growth in 2023 and beyond. And that is on the back of the CH-53K, which is a program of record as well as new awards, FLRAA being the most significant.\nJim Taiclet: And the timing, we think on FLRAA or at least what the Army has stated is that, there is a decision to be announced in September of 2022. That slipped a month or two from the original plan, but we're expecting and hoping for a good news on that front when the announcement is made.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please, go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. I got three little questions for you, Jay. You previously said that F-35 impact from not signing 15 to 17 would be 500, now 325. So I was curious as to the difference. Second one, the classified, you mentioned, was up $210 million. Was that the same program that you took the charge last year? And the third one was, why is the space margin go down in the second half of the year when you'll have more launches, so ULA profits ought to be higher. Thanks.\nJay Malave: Okay. Good questions, George. Let me maybe go backwards. On the Space margin, you're right. We do have stronger ULA launches in the back half, which will give us lift. Offsetting that is where we're seeing some margin pressure, as we have growth on new programs as well as classified programs, which are coming with pretty low margins, which are pretty dilutive. And so, that's just putting some pressure on the margin in the back half of the year. We'll keep monitoring that, but that's pretty much where we are now. On the $210 million, that was basically the absence of the charge in the classified program last year in Aero. If you recall that the charge itself was $225 million in the second quarter last year. And then on the F-35, the delta, we said that the -- coming into the quarter and throughout my remarks at various conferences, the impact could be as high as $500 million. We were able to obtain some incremental funding, some international funding in the quarter, which helped us reduce that impact to this $325 million.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please, go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Sorry, calling from the airshow, it might be a little choppy. But maybe back to the F-35, the Pentagon a few months ago was suggesting that the contract for Lot 15 to 17 could cover in the order of 400 aircraft versus the 375 that you have a handshake deal on. So, considering the demand from international partners, why is the total volume lower? And then also a follow-up to that is, when you think about the potential for progressional plus up and this international demand, I would assume there's some urgency from some of our partners. Is there upside to that 375? How firm is that figure?\nJay Malave: It's an excellent question, Kristine. I think there could be some variability right now, but still TBD. As we mentioned -- Jim, in the opening remarks, we still need to definitize this particular agreement. We did see in the President's budget, specifically, really the 2023 budget would have had mostly impacting Lot 17 is where you see these lower reductions. They've talked about the funding constraints relative to the nuclear modernization and other items. And so that's something that we just keep monitoring. They did -- as you said, Kristine, in the unfunded priority list, wanted to add back 19 aircraft. Obviously, we're very supportive of that. And that's something that we're certainly pursuing. And we're confident there'll be something there, and it's really TBD over the next few months as Jim noted in his remarks. But there could be some upside, and we just have to let the process play out.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Spingarn: Good morning. Jim and Jay, there's been a lot of talk on growth here. And of course, the near-term numbers have been under pressure. But when you think about the growth components of your four pillars, can you talk about the larger pieces of opportunity there? I was maybe hoping for a bit of review on hypersonics and if you can still hit that $3 billion target? And then some of the other major programs that are going to drive growth, two -- it sounds like a couple of years from now when that -- when the clutch kicks in as you say.\nJim Taiclet: So, Rob, let me start, it's Jim here, on sort of the overall strategic approach that we have and then I'll turn it over to Jay for some of the programmatic details and color. So, look we're focusing on the things we can control versus what we can't control, right? So, what we can't control right now is the level of inflation-adjusted defense budget, which, given 9%-ish inflation, is pretty flat. We can't control the duration of US government and the FMS processes, although we're advocating for those to be speeded up and streamlined. We can't control the timing of legacy programs, so sunsetting, if you will, or at least a reduction in rate volume like Black Hawk, for example. We can't control COVID virus and its effects on the supply chain and our own people. But what we can focus on is our strategic approach of running this company to maximize free cash flow per share in any circumstance, right? So, during this time of, as you pointed out, pressure on topline revenue, we've really used our dynamic capital allocation approach to -- in a slow revenue growth period to still drive by R&D and CapEx because we want to invest for the future growth, but at the same time, ramp up share repurchase and we're going to continue on that path as well. The goal then is to take down the share count in the relatively low growth period. So when the high-growth period comes about, you've got kind of a turbocharger on the investors' basis, if you will. So we think shareholder value inflection point comes mid-decade because the revenue growth we expect to ramp in, we're doing a lot on the efficiency side, something we can control over the next two, three years with our digital transformation and other cost control efforts that we've actually redoubled recently. And so we're going to continue to invest in the business, and so we can make that -- during this period so we can make that inflection point as attractive as possible for you as we expect it to come. So, with that I\u2019ll offer it back to Jay to give you some of those four-pillar details.\nJay Malave: Sure. Rob, our pillars are still intact. You mentioned hypersonics, and we're still pretty confident in our growth outlook there. And I just mentioned that our air-launched rapid response weapon program. We had two recent successful tests, one in May and one recently in July. And so we're very successful there with the capability that we continue to progress forward and where this is going. And so that's all really good news as far as our hypersonics capability and what we're providing and advancing from a technology standpoint. We've talked about our classified programs. We continue to progress there, and we continue to see the growth. I mentioned in my prepared remarks where we saw a significant growth in our Aero classified business this past quarter, and that's just one example of that being on track. We also had the third pillar of programs of record. We've talked about that we've got a ramp that's built into the PAC-3 and the question there is can that go higher and when. CH-53K, Jim mentioned the 200-plus aircraft there, and that's on track. We just as we -- as you know on our charts here, talked about the initial operating capability for the aircraft, and everything is moving forward as well there. We've talked about F-35 sustainment, a 6% CAGR between 2021 and 2026. And so those, again, remain pretty much intact. And then I just mentioned the competitive new wins. FLRAA is a big, big one. We've also got some other large programs, which are doing all the main type programs, Defense of Guam that Jim just spoke about. There's a similar type program in Australia for, called Air 6500, which is an important program for us, important program for the country. We talked about next-gen interceptor being a source of growth in the quarter. And that's something that's also in our new win category as well. And so these things are on track, and we've had this conversation about a growing pipeline. And I gave some color on that before in some of the Q&A. But again, the pipeline is growing. It just becomes a question of when that actually turns into orders and when that turns into revenue conversion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Yes. Good morning Jim and Jay. Jim, you mentioned about the free cash flow per share and being able to see that inflection point. Maybe if you could just comment a little bit on your ability to just grow cash flow generation and grow the cash generation in general, when you're thinking about not only the supply chain headwinds, whether you're carrying more inventory or just in case, just your overall approach there? Do you see an opportunity for Lockheed to really increase the $8 billion plus cash from operations opportunity? Thanks.\nJim Taiclet: So -- and Jay can add to this. We'll look out to the next few years with some, sort of, trending information later in the fall. So I don't want to speak to numbers. But what we can speak to is, again, the reduction in share count. We hope and expect to have ramping revenue down the road, which we should be able to convert into cash flow. So without getting into magnitudes, that's the mechanics of how we are planning for this to play out. But Jay, if you want to add more.\nJay Malave: Yes. We\u2019ve previously provided a multiyear outlook. It was generally flattish, Peter. And that was really due to our increased investment. Remember what we're doing, it's twofold. One on the investment is to get to fly -- the growth flywheel recranked, which is what we're laser-focused on. But as Jim mentioned, we're also investing on our core capability and efficiencies within our four walls. And our digital transformation is a significant investment and is a significant initiative to make sure that we can deliver efficiencies and also make ourselves more competitive. And so that is what's driving, generally, I'll call it, a flattish outlook from a free cash flow perspective. But having said that, going back to Jim's comments as far as efficiency, efficiency doesn't stop at the P&L and on the cost. We're also going to drive efficiency in our asset management, and that should be a source of better cash flow from where we are today. That's something that we have to take a look at. As Jim mentioned, we'll have to look at what that means from a trending perspective over the next few years that we'll provide in October. But the opportunity set is there for us to drive efficiency and even offset where we may have to provide buffer stock from a supply chain perspective and things like that. There's always opportunity to drive efficiency in our operations, and that's what we'll be focused on. And don't forget that we will -- we also in that talked about continuing to deliver around 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchase. We remain committed to that, and there will be more to come as far as specifics in October.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Thanks very much and good morning, everyone.\nJay Malave: Good morning.\nSeth Seifman: So on the F-35 outlook, when we think about the 156 a year around mid-decade and beyond, how do you think about the mix there between domestic and international, given that some of the budget pressures you're talking about like nuclear modernization aren't going away? And then just kind of a couple of cleanup questions. The 375, I just want to be clear about the number there. It would seem that the international portion of that is going to be, on average, 50 or fewer per year, which is down from where it was in the prior economic or finally I just wanted to confirm that. And then also, what's the delivery expectation for 2022?\nJim Taiclet: So Seth, it's Jim. The mix of priority between US and international is set by the Joint Program Office and US government. So we can't really speak to an estimate, future estimate for that. But the fact of the matter is the jets performing extremely well for the US services, the fly, and the commandos will tell you that. Navy is especially impressed because they've done actual fleet tours and exercises in the Western Pacific last year -- over the last six to 12 months and seen it in operation at scale and exercises, which we're really happy with and some of the other services, too. On the international side, you see the interest, including Germany now and others. And I think that's going to continue to increase, both in Asia and in Europe, by the way. So we're confident that the F-35 is here to stay, and we're going to drive through the program. We just can't give you an estimate of US government allocations over the next few years, that's something that they do. Jay, anything else you'd add?\nJay Malave: No, that covers it.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. \nMatt Akers: Yes, hey good morning. Thanks for the question. I wonder if you could touch on Missiles and Fire Control margins, and they've been sort of running a little bit higher in the last couple of quarters. I know there was some positive adjustments in there. But if you could just kind of set our expectations of kind of what normal margins look like on that business kind of going forward?\nJay Malave: Yes. Good question, Matt. Very strong performance through the first half of the year in excess of 15%. We do expect it to step back down in the second half of the year. It's primarily due to lower step-ups and some contract mix. And so, we see some just against some of the newer classified programs ramp up. And then we see just the solid performance was really somewhat of an acceleration of good performance into the first half of the year versus the second half. And so that's just going to be a natural decline there.  Having said that, we did -- they are holding their profit in spite of the lower revenue outlook. And so, their margins are going up relative to what we thought coming into the year. So, we'll kind of -- we'll watch them because their performance has been solid, if anything, maybe there's a little bit of upside there. But again, it's just a function of the timing of what we see in terms of visibility to step up changes to profit rate adjustments and in the program contract mix.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global. Please go ahead. \nPete Skibitski: Hey good morning, everyone. Jim, I just want to maybe drill down into your thinking about how the US goes about replenishing its stocks. Obviously, in terms of your programs, you think about programs like Javelin but even bigger ticket items like HIMARS and I think maybe GMLRS. I think the US has sent over quite a few of those systems to Ukraine. So, are you guys thinking that basically, it will take until the fiscal year '24 budget is approved for the US to kind of reprogram that replenishment in and get it approved and then the orders start flowing? Is that kind of the right way to think about it?\nJim Taiclet: It's too soon to tell. There are some initiatives ongoing from some of the services in the Department of Defense to put more energy behind replenishment. But that's early in their process. So, we don't have full visibility to it. We're supporting it, of course, and making sure they understand what the capacity capabilities are over the next two, three years to get up to higher volumes. But those actual decisions on timing and budgets will come from the services and the Department of Defense and through the administration. So, we can't really comment on the specifics of that. We do expect it to come, though. It's a matter of timing as I kind of outlined earlier.\nGreg Gardner: Well, Brad, we're coming up on the top of the hour. I think everybody who was in the queue has had a chance to ask a question. So with that, I will turn the call over to Jim for some closing remarks.\nJim Taiclet: Sure. I just want to first thank all the men and women of Lockheed Martin for their dedication to our mission and their continuing commitment in spite of COVID and other stresses that all of us are facing in our personal and professional lives now. But all those stresses in spite of those, they're providing truly innovative and comprehensive mission solutions for our customers, which is really where I think our whole industry needs to go, as mission solution in addition to great exquisite platforms and effective systems.  So I want to thank you all, investors, again, too, for joining us today. And we look forward to speaking to you again, as Jay said, in October for our next earnings call. So Brad, that concludes the call. Everybody, I hope to have a great rest of the week.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference Services. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks Greg. Good morning, everybody, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2022 earnings call. I will begin today with an update on our F-35 program. Yesterday, we signed a bilateral record of negotiation with the US government, reaching agreement on the Lots 15 through 17 production contract. Through a collaborative effort with the F-35 enterprise, including the Joint Program Office, suppliers, and teammates, we have concurred on the major parameters of the program, addressing inflationary and pandemic-related issues unanticipated at the start of the negotiation process. The agreement supports our long-term objective to produce 156 aircraft a year. However, COVID impacts experienced by the F-35 enterprise have required us to modify our near-term production plan. Deliveries over the next two years are expected to remain in the 147 to 153 range of aircraft, similar to our 2022 plan, before we then achieve our 156 aircraft delivery target in 2025. We continue to anticipate annual deliveries of 156 jets beyond 2025 for the foreseeable future. I'd like to thank the entire team for the dedication and professionalism shown throughout this process and we look forward to delivering these unmatched fifth generation aircrafts for our US Air Force, Navy, and Marines, our partner countries, and our international customers. Moving to our quarterly results. Our business area operational performance was solid, delivering increased profit margins from last year's second quarter. Our new business activity and order flow were also favorable, and we continue to anticipate our backlog ending the year significantly above our 2021 levels, positioning us for longer term growth. Our sales in the quarter were $15.4 billion, lower than we expected due to the delay in contract agreement on the F-35 and supply chain impacts. We anticipate the supply chain challenges to continue for the remainder of the year and we've reduced our 2022 outlook to reflect that as well as some other items, and Jay will cover this in more detail in a few minutes. We also progressed well on our cash deployment plan, delivering over $1.1 billion to stockholders in dividends and repurchases, exceeding 100% of our free cash flow. We will continue to execute on our strategy of driving cash generation, disciplined and dynamic capital deployment, growing free cash flow per share and delivering attractive long-term total returns to you, shareholders. Turning briefly to budgets. Both the House and Senate Armed Services Committees approved their versions of the FY 2023 National Defense Authorization Act. The SASC recommended approximately a $45 billion increase to the President's request and the full House chamber passed the completed authorization bill with a $37 billion increase. While the budget process remains in its early stages, we are encouraged by the support our programs have seen with the Senate recommending additional F-35 and Black Hawk helicopters, increases over the lower-than-expected volumes that were in the initial presence request. Both the Senate markup and the House bill received strong bipartisan supporting committee with recognition of the need for greater investment to respond to increasing global security threats and the imperative of improving the readiness of our armed forces. Congress will continue the next phase of the authorization and appropriations process over the coming weeks and months. And we look forward to its timely finalization. Turning to our 21st Century Security strategy, I'd like to highlight an important example of how our signature platforms can be integrated into effective joint all-domain operations. These efforts are designed to benefit our soldiers, sailors, marines, airmen and guardians by continually upgrading their mission capabilities with the latest physical and digital world technologies. This quarter, our Rotary and Mission Systems and Missiles and Fire Control business areas partnered with the US Indo-Pacific Command in Valiant Shield 2022. This is a biannual training activity focused on integrating forces in multiple domains. Valiant Shield 2022 is a cornerstone of INDOPACOM's integrated deterrent strategy to prevent conflict in the region, and it's the largest US joint force exercise in the Western Pacific. We linked our DIAMONDShield battle management system, AEGIS Weapon System, High Mobility Artillery Rocket System or HMARS and PAC-3 missiles to successfully demonstrate integrated multi-domain operations of strategic and tactical mission levels across air, land, sea and space. During this 12-day event, our Lockheed Martin team demonstrated all domain capabilities and collaboratively engaged in experiments with INDOPACOM using artificial intelligence to enable rapid decision making in seconds or minutes compared to ours. Technical demonstrations like these are key enablers to our four-pillar growth strategy. And we will continue to demonstrate to our frontline commanders and servicemen and women in many additional exercise and real-world demonstrations to come. Moving to our four-pillar growth areas and staying with the Pacific region, RMS' Aegis Weapon System was selected to be the backbone system for the Missile Defense Agency's Defense of Guam architecture. This is a pathfinder for joint all-domain operations for the DoD and for regional integrated air and missile defense with an expected program value itself of over $1 billion. This architecture will defend against ballistic, cruise and hypersonic missile threats through the integration of capabilities across multiple industry products and not just Lockheed Martin. Aegis and our TPY-X radar, a derivative of our long-range discrimination radar product, will be the core systems to outpace the potential threat and expand JADO capabilities for Guam. This Guam architecture leverages existing Lockheed Martin capabilities such as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense or THAAD, PAC-3, Sentinel A4 radar and our C2BMC command and control system, highlighting the advantages of our broad portfolio and cross-business area collaboration with Missiles and Fire Control. RMS will also fully integrate future system capabilities, which may include space-based sensors, directed energy and advanced missiles in the Defense of Guam, a critical cornerstone in Western Pacific deterrence. And we'll be using an open architecture where we can tie-in other prime contractors, products and systems along with ours. Staying with RMS, this quarter, the US Marine Corps approved our Sikorsky teams CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, one of our key programs of record for initial operating capability. The IOC declaration validates the operational readiness of the King Stallion to forward deploy Marines across the globe and positions the Marine Corps for a full rate production decision in 2023. The 53K has a plan of record to deliver 200 domestic aircraft and a total program life cycle value expected to be approximately $50 billion. We're also excited this quarter to receive a $2.3 billion award for Sikorsky's 10th Black Hawk multiyear contract to provide 120 H60 helicopters. This contract includes options, which, if exercised, have the potential to deliver an additional 135 rotorcraft with a value of up to another $4.4 billion. Also this quarter, Missiles and Fire Control received a $1.6 billion contract award to produce THAAD interceptors for both domestic and international customers. Under this combined buy award, the THAAD team will provide both the US government and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with additional interceptors in support of integrated air and missile defense. Our MFC business area was also awarded a contract by the Missile Defense Agency to initiate production of the eighth THAAD battery. The eighth battery expands the US government's ability to field the integrated air and missile defenses and builds upon the previously delivered 7 systems, a clear demonstration of the value delivered by the signature program and defending against current and emerging threats and maintaining the turns. Before I turn the call over to Jay, I'd like to express my appreciation for the presidential visit to the Javelin manufacturing facility in Troy, Alabama, supporting the men and women who produce this remarkable product. The Ukraine conflict has been a dramatic reminder that we're in a global power competition. And we at Lockheed Martin stand ready to support our nation and its allies with advanced systems and technologies. The US alone has committed more than 5,500 Javelin missiles to Ukraine in defense of their country. And this visit spotlighted the continued need for a focus on global security and deterrence capabilities. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later to answer your questions. Good morning. Yeah. And just to add to that, in response to your question there, Richard, is look, the DoD is in the midst of changing gears and so are our allies, right? So at the beginning of 2022, the administration was still in the midst of a relatively benign global security environment at least relative to now. The US has largely withdrawn from its military operations after two decades of heavy presence in the Middle East. China's increasing activism in the Western Pacific, while recognized was perceived as kind of a potential concern, a watch item for the future, if you will. Europe was totally at peace, and Russian forces remained within their borders at that point in time. But if you fast forward to today, the US and its allies are actively responding to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The Pacific is on higher alert because of the statements and actions of China recently, not to mention North Korea. The value of deterrence has never been greater really at this point now. And that shift happened over literally three or four months. What that requires is the Department of Defense to shift gears, okay? And I can tell you the clutch isn't engaged yet. And the clutch engaged means there are contracts in place. There's a demand signal out there that's clear. There's funding appropriated by the US Congress in the case of the United States. And we're producing, as Jay said, with a supply chain that's robust enough to support it. To get the clutch to engage is going to take two to three years. And that's for our allies as well because they not only have to go through their own processes internally. They then have to go through generally the foreign military sales process. And for the kinds of systems that Jay outlined, the US government is probably going to continue to insist that we mostly use the FMS process to contract with foreign -- through them to foreign governments for these kinds of equipments like F-35 and F-16 and HIMARS, et cetera. So we actually have a match to our original strategy, which was for the next couple of years, we were expecting relatively flat defense budgets in the US, not a lot of concern out in the allies. That's all changed. But we're aiming for the company and for the share count to be ready for an inflection point now again, in 2024 and beyond, the middle of the decade. This unfortunate situation in global security having deteriorated can only bolster our inflection point from where it would have been. And along with that, we're doing the integration of our signature platforms that everybody seems to want right now into that 21st Century Security fabric, which will make them, we think, even more attractive. And then we'll bring in our counterparts along onto that open architecture going forward. So I do think that it's going to take a while for the clutch to engage here, both in the US and internationally. But the demand in the situation that our customer base is facing has dramatically changed over the last three, four months. Good morning. And the timing, we think on FLRAA or at least what the Army has stated is that, there is a decision to be announced in September of 2022. That slipped a month or two from the original plan, but we're expecting and hoping for a good news on that front when the announcement is made. So, Rob, let me start, it's Jim here, on sort of the overall strategic approach that we have and then I'll turn it over to Jay for some of the programmatic details and color. So, look we're focusing on the things we can control versus what we can't control, right? So, what we can't control right now is the level of inflation-adjusted defense budget, which, given 9%-ish inflation, is pretty flat. We can't control the duration of US government and the FMS processes, although we're advocating for those to be speeded up and streamlined. We can't control the timing of legacy programs, so sunsetting, if you will, or at least a reduction in rate volume like Black Hawk, for example. We can't control COVID virus and its effects on the supply chain and our own people. But what we can focus on is our strategic approach of running this company to maximize free cash flow per share in any circumstance, right? So, during this time of, as you pointed out, pressure on topline revenue, we've really used our dynamic capital allocation approach to -- in a slow revenue growth period to still drive by R&D and CapEx because we want to invest for the future growth, but at the same time, ramp up share repurchase and we're going to continue on that path as well. The goal then is to take down the share count in the relatively low growth period. So when the high-growth period comes about, you've got kind of a turbocharger on the investors' basis, if you will. So we think shareholder value inflection point comes mid-decade because the revenue growth we expect to ramp in, we're doing a lot on the efficiency side, something we can control over the next two, three years with our digital transformation and other cost control efforts that we've actually redoubled recently. And so we're going to continue to invest in the business, and so we can make that -- during this period so we can make that inflection point as attractive as possible for you as we expect it to come. So, with that I'll offer it back to Jay to give you some of those four-pillar details. So -- and Jay can add to this. We'll look out to the next few years with some, sort of, trending information later in the fall. So I don't want to speak to numbers. But what we can speak to is, again, the reduction in share count. We hope and expect to have ramping revenue down the road, which we should be able to convert into cash flow. So without getting into magnitudes, that's the mechanics of how we are planning for this to play out. But Jay, if you want to add more. So Seth, it's Jim. The mix of priority between US and international is set by the Joint Program Office and US government. So we can't really speak to an estimate, future estimate for that. But the fact of the matter is the jets performing extremely well for the US services, the fly, and the commandos will tell you that. Navy is especially impressed because they've done actual fleet tours and exercises in the Western Pacific last year -- over the last six to 12 months and seen it in operation at scale and exercises, which we're really happy with and some of the other services, too. On the international side, you see the interest, including Germany now and others. And I think that's going to continue to increase, both in Asia and in Europe, by the way. So we're confident that the F-35 is here to stay, and we're going to drive through the program. We just can't give you an estimate of US government allocations over the next few years, that's something that they do. Jay, anything else you'd add? It's too soon to tell. There are some initiatives ongoing from some of the services in the Department of Defense to put more energy behind replenishment. But that's early in their process.

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our consolidated results, business area detail and provide an update to our 2022 outlook. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with Chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated second quarter financials. Operating results were largely in line with our expectations for the quarter along with non-operating impacts that we previously had highlighted. We generated sales of $15.4 billion. And as Jim noted, our revenues were affected by the delayed contract agreement for production Lots 15 to 17 on the F-35 program and supply chain impacts. Underlying performance was solid with segment operating profit of $1.7 billion and segment margin expansion of 60 basis points year-over-year to 11%.  Earnings per share were $1.16, including $5.16 in nonoperational charges. And we delivered greater than $1 billion in free cash flow, while returning 107% of that amount to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. As noted in the press release, we updated our outlook, which I'll review later in my remarks.  Turning to consolidated sales and segment operating profit results on chart four. Total sales declined 9% due to anticipated program transitions and supply chain impacts across the business areas, in addition to more than $300 million in revenue shortfall from the gap in F-35 funding in advance of our agreement on Lots 15 through 17.  Operating profit declined 4%. And as previously mentioned, segment operating margins expanded 60 basis points to 11%, reflecting another quarter of solid underlying performance, benefits from contract mix, as well as higher net step-ups largely due to the absence of last year's classified program charge in Aeronautics.  Moving to earnings per share on chart five, we've included a reconciliation of our GAAP EPS to an adjusted or operational EPS. First, we've refinanced $2.3 billion of outstanding debt, claiming maturities for the next three years and lowering our near-term exposure to interest rate risk. This impact was $0.10. In addition, we executed our latest pension transfer transaction. And as a reminder, this is our seventh such transaction to reduce long-term risk and volatility of pension trust asset returns. The impact to the quarter was $4.49, including $0.16 of tax timing that will reverse over the balance of the year.  Lastly, volatile capital markets have significantly impacted asset returns and our Lockheed Martin Ventures fund and other plans. Despite the short-term volatility, our Ventures fund has delivered significant financial returns over the long term, but more importantly, has infused Lockheed Martin with emerging technologies to benefit our core business. Adjusted for these nonoperating items, our second quarter earnings per share would have been $6.32 and even higher had the F-35 funding constraint been lifted.  Moving to cash flow on chart six. As you've come to expect, we delivered solid free cash flow in the quarter and accelerated payments of $1 billion to suppliers. Once again, cash deployed to shareholders exceeded free cash flow in the quarter and for the first half of 2022, we have returned 178% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases.  Okay, moving over to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on chart seven. Second quarter revenue decreased approximately $800 million from last year. F-35 sales were down over $900 million due to supply chain impacts, the impact of the Lot 15 through 17 unrecognized sales and sustainment award timing. This was partially offset by strength in our classified area, which increased by more than $200 million this quarter, a 50% increase from the second quarter of 2021. Segment operating margin for Aero increased 180 basis points primarily due to the absence of last year's loss recorded on a large classified program.  Moving to Missiles and Fire Control on page eight. Sales were lower by approximately $200 million, including the expected reduction in sustainment following the withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan, as well as lower volume in multiple missile programs. Strong performance in tactical and strike missiles and in the missile defense PAC-3 program, as well as favorable program mix drove a 160 basis points increase in segment operating margin. At Rotary and Mission Systems on page nine, lower Black Hawk and presidential helicopter volume, along with supply chain impacts across the business area, lowered year-over-year sales by approximately $200 million. Operating profit was lower based on fewer favorable profit adjustments on Aegis and Radar programs, the impact from lower volume and changes in contract mix. Turning to chart 10 in our Space business area. Overall sales were down $350 million by a $425 -- or driven by a $425 million reduction from the renationalization of the atomic weapons establishment, which is partially offset by solid growth on a next-generation interceptor program. This will be the last quarter we'll be affected by the AWE compare. Operating profit was lower primarily due to the mix and timing of launches at United Launch Alliance as well as lower profit step-ups. Okay. Moving over to our updated outlook on page 11. Our expectations for segment operating profit and free cash flow remain unchanged despite a lower sales outlook, reflecting solid year-to-date results and management's focus on operating performance. Our expectation for full year sales have been by $750 million to approximately $65.25 billion. Three of our four business areas have been reduced due to supply chain impacts, award timing and program schedule shifts, all of which are incorporated into our new guidance. The impact of lower anticipated sales volume is expected to be offset by improved margins for the year, which is supported by our year-to-date margin performance. We are lowering the earnings per share outlook by $5.15 to reflect the impact of one-time items, such as the pension transfer, debt refinancing and year-to-date mark-to-market adjustments. It's important to note that these expectations assume that we definitize the Lot 15 through 17 contract here in the third quarter. In addition, there are no incremental mark-to-market impacts assumed for the second half of the year. Okay. Moving to Chart 12. We provided a detailed view of the changes to earnings per share for the year. The one-time pension settlement charge is now included in our outlook. And following the execution of that pension transfer, the remeasurement of our pension plans has caused us to reduce our FAS/CAS pension adjustment by $50 million. We've also incorporated the impacts of the year-to-date mark-to-market adjustments and our debt refinanced to the new estimate of approximately $21.55. On chart 13, you'll see the changes to guidance by business area. As I mentioned before, three of our four business areas have reduced sales outlooks, reflecting supply chain impact and award timing. But as noted, each business area is holding to the previous guidance for segment operating profit. We're confident that we can deliver higher operating margins, offsetting the top line headwinds with our continued focus on cost reduction, program performance and leveraging the size and scale of the enterprise. Okay. Let's wrap up on chart 14. Our operational performance in the second quarter was solid, with improved segment margins and consistent cash generation and deployment. We revised our 2022 financial outlook, incorporating headwinds, but held our commitments for segment operating profit, free cash flow and cash deployment. Now looking beyond 2022, the Lockheed Martin fundamentals remain strong. We continue to invest in support of our customers' important security missions, leveraging the breadth of our platforms and solutions. Our broad portfolio as well as the current and projected backlog underpin our future growth expectations. In addition, the outlook for domestic and international defense spending has improved and we expect to incorporate these changes over the coming months as we gain clarity on the timing of global security spending commitments and industry fulfillment. To close, our pillars of growth, financial position, focus on strong cash generation, and our disciplined and dynamic capital deployment strategy places us in an enviable position to deliver long-term value to shareholders. With that, Brad, let's open up the call for Q&A. Let me walk you through the reconciling item here on your first question, Doug. So, first, when we ended the second quarter, our backlog was 169 aircraft. If you assume, say, the midpoint of 2022 of our guide, let's say, 150 aircraft that says that we would be delivering about another 89 aircraft in the back half of the year. That would take our backlog down to 80 aircraft. With the 375, that puts us at 455. So, if you assume again at the midpoint for 2023 and 2024 of about 100 aircraft -- 150 aircraft, that puts you at 300. That leaves about 155 for 2025. And so maybe one short to the 156 in 2025, but pretty much right there. As far as the lower outlook, a lot of that was incorporated in our negotiation on Lot 15 to 17 in terms of the factors, we've talked about before as far as impacts from COVID, impacts in supply chain, also lower volumes and other factors. And all of that was taken into consideration in the negotiation with the Joint Program Office. The margins themselves at the end of the day, the way the contract is structured as we finalize this is there will be some level of fixed price to it and some level of incentive to it. So, we're incentivized to perform and provide delivery, to provide delivery as well as quality targets to the customer. If we can perform to our expectation in those improvements, then we wouldn't see any type of dilution to our margins today. And we're confident we can perform to those levels. Sure, Richard. Yeah, let me get started on that. I think the takeaway here in the closing remarks is that -- as I mentioned, the environment has improved from where it was a year ago. And along with that, our pipeline has certainly grown. And I'll throw maybe a couple of examples to that. We've seen, I think, in the press in terms of higher demand, and we've seen new contracts on the F-35. There's also interest on the F-16 with international partners and customers. And we've talked about we've got a backlog today of 128 aircraft. We're pleased to have Germany coming to the fold -- or I'm sorry, Jordan come into the fold as well. But beyond that we've talked about a pipeline 300 to 400 additional aircraft. That pipeline has grown to about 500 aircraft, given what we've seen over the past six months, six to 12 months. And so in our Aero, in these aircraft, we see incremental opportunities. I'd say similarly in our Missiles and Fire Control, both on the air and missile defense side as well as tactical missile side, we've seen inquiries on foreign military sales. And that pipeline has grown as well, and that's in, say, the multibillion dollars of opportunity. Things like -- things that have been out there in the press, whether it's Javelin, HIMARS as well as PAC-3 opportunities. It's important to remember that in the PAC-3 we are increasing our outlook and our production schedules to begin with. And so the question is how much higher can we take it over the next number of years. As this correlates and I mentioned in my remark that we'll gain more clarity in terms of how these things will actually manifest themselves into real contracts. The reality is today, none of it is under contract. And so we're trying to get a better understanding what the timing, of which these will come into contract and then getting a better understanding of our supply chain capability to determine when we can actually deliver. But I can say with some level of reasonable confidence is that our orders and backlog outlook over the next two years will be better than it was a year ago. But that will still take some time to convert to revenues beyond that time period. Jay, I wanted to ask about the pension. So I saw you mark-to-market with the pension transfer. So $50 million worse this year, but what does that mean for -- based on where things are today, given big time negative asset returns, what are you thinking about for pension in the next couple of years relative to what you guided for prior? I think it was $2.3 billion in pension income in 2023 and $2 billion in 2024. Thanks. Yes. Good question, David. This year, excluding the impact of the one-ime charges, we're $2.2 billion for the total FAS/CAS adjustment. I'll break it down. On the FAS side, interestingly, is you're right, David. The assets -- not only did we lose $4.3 billion worth of assets with the pension transfer, but the returns are lower, too. And so that will impact our returns next year. But that is essentially entirely offset by lower amortized losses associated with the pension transfer that we just took. So I would expect our pension, our total adjustment in our FAS is going to be flat. So about 400 \u2013 in 400 and change this year to be about 400 and change next year. Similarly, on CAS, we're seeing similar types of effects where next year, the CAS costs will be similar to what it was this year. That is higher than what we are anticipating it to be coming into this year for 2023. So, we'll have to evaluate whether that has any impact on the backlog of our contract, but when you look at it year-over-year, it's essentially flat. Going beyond that, we'll have to kind of update you, I think, in our October call and we give the trending data. But I can say right now for '23, essentially flat. Yes. Good question, Cai. Going back in the beginning of the year, everyone was impacted by the latest variant that we had. And our operations were impacted, our supply chain operations were impact \u2013 and I think our ability to recover from that has been more challenging than we originally anticipated. We have seen some level of improvement in certain areas of not only our operations, but also our supplier operations. But we've also seen broken commitments at the same time. And so, it just caused us to reassess what this meant for the year.  And so, while we do see some improvement, our ability to recover the lost time in the beginning of the year has just become too much of a challenge. And that's really the question when you go beyond '22 now, is how -- does that ripple through? As you see -- Jim mentioned, the COVID impacts on the 135 as an example, we're seeing that ripple through, through multiple years. And so that's something that we just have to continue to evaluate and take a look at what that means to '23 and beyond.  As far as labor, labor has been an ongoing challenge, I think, for the industry as well as us. I think we've -- given the size and the scale of Lockheed Martin, I think that we've been able to weather it reasonably well. And as an example, on F-16, we've been able to take close to 50 employees out of a different operation, an international operation and bring it into Greenville, South Carolina to help us stand up and move quicker on the F-16 program. So, it just goes to the strength and the breadth that we have here at Lockheed Martin.  But nonetheless, it's been a challenge. Our ramp on that program is taking longer than we had originally anticipated largely because of the slower ramp in hiring employees. We're pretty laser-focused on it. We have a dedicated team -- HR team that is focused on hiring people. They are very focused on a particular radius to bring those people in, and I think we're on a good track now with our new schedule. We expect to deliver aircraft next year, and then we'll get to a more strong -- more of a run rate -- full capacity run rate for Greenville in 2024.  So hopefully, that answers all your questions, Cai. But again, it's been \u2013 again, supply chain has been choppy for the year. The reason why we took it -- took the expectation down is, we expect it to continue to be choppy for the remainder of the year. And we'll have to reassess it when we give our training data in terms of what it means for 2023 and beyond. So on Sikorsky, we expect to return to growth really starting in 2023 for that business. We're expecting, as you mentioned, the FLRAA decision, which we've been told which should be coming in September. We believe that we are the best choice for that platform, and that is a pillar of our growth. If you may recall, both John Mollard and Jim Taiclet had talked about the four pillars of growth, and one of those being new awards, FLRAA was one of those programs that we have talked about. And so, we expect to see incremental growth in 2023 and beyond. And that is on the back of the CH-53K, which is a program of record as well as new awards, FLRAA being the most significant. Okay. Good questions, George. Let me maybe go backwards. On the Space margin, you're right. We do have stronger ULA launches in the back half, which will give us lift. Offsetting that is where we're seeing some margin pressure, as we have growth on new programs as well as classified programs, which are coming with pretty low margins, which are pretty dilutive. And so, that's just putting some pressure on the margin in the back half of the year. We'll keep monitoring that, but that's pretty much where we are now. On the $210 million, that was basically the absence of the charge in the classified program last year in Aero. If you recall that the charge itself was $225 million in the second quarter last year. And then on the F-35, the delta, we said that the -- coming into the quarter and throughout my remarks at various conferences, the impact could be as high as $500 million. We were able to obtain some incremental funding, some international funding in the quarter, which helped us reduce that impact to this $325 million. It's an excellent question, Kristine. I think there could be some variability right now, but still TBD. As we mentioned -- Jim, in the opening remarks, we still need to definitize this particular agreement. We did see in the President's budget, specifically, really the 2023 budget would have had mostly impacting Lot 17 is where you see these lower reductions. They've talked about the funding constraints relative to the nuclear modernization and other items. And so that's something that we just keep monitoring. They did -- as you said, Kristine, in the unfunded priority list, wanted to add back 19 aircraft. Obviously, we're very supportive of that. And that's something that we're certainly pursuing. And we're confident there'll be something there, and it's really TBD over the next few months as Jim noted in his remarks. But there could be some upside, and we just have to let the process play out. Sure. Rob, our pillars are still intact. You mentioned hypersonics, and we're still pretty confident in our growth outlook there. And I just mentioned that our air-launched rapid response weapon program. We had two recent successful tests, one in May and one recently in July. And so we're very successful there with the capability that we continue to progress forward and where this is going. And so that's all really good news as far as our hypersonics capability and what we're providing and advancing from a technology standpoint. We've talked about our classified programs. We continue to progress there, and we continue to see the growth. I mentioned in my prepared remarks where we saw a significant growth in our Aero classified business this past quarter, and that's just one example of that being on track. We also had the third pillar of programs of record. We've talked about that we've got a ramp that's built into the PAC-3 and the question there is can that go higher and when. CH-53K, Jim mentioned the 200-plus aircraft there, and that's on track. We just as we -- as you know on our charts here, talked about the initial operating capability for the aircraft, and everything is moving forward as well there. We've talked about F-35 sustainment, a 6% CAGR between 2021 and 2026. And so those, again, remain pretty much intact. And then I just mentioned the competitive new wins. FLRAA is a big, big one. We've also got some other large programs, which are doing all the main type programs, Defense of Guam that Jim just spoke about. There's a similar type program in Australia for, called Air 6500, which is an important program for us, important program for the country. We talked about next-gen interceptor being a source of growth in the quarter. And that's something that's also in our new win category as well. And so these things are on track, and we've had this conversation about a growing pipeline. And I gave some color on that before in some of the Q&A. But again, the pipeline is growing. It just becomes a question of when that actually turns into orders and when that turns into revenue conversion. Yes. We've previously provided a multiyear outlook. It was generally flattish, Peter. And that was really due to our increased investment. Remember what we're doing, it's twofold. One on the investment is to get to fly -- the growth flywheel recranked, which is what we're laser-focused on. But as Jim mentioned, we're also investing on our core capability and efficiencies within our four walls. And our digital transformation is a significant investment and is a significant initiative to make sure that we can deliver efficiencies and also make ourselves more competitive. And so that is what's driving, generally, I'll call it, a flattish outlook from a free cash flow perspective. But having said that, going back to Jim's comments as far as efficiency, efficiency doesn't stop at the P&L and on the cost. We're also going to drive efficiency in our asset management, and that should be a source of better cash flow from where we are today. That's something that we have to take a look at. As Jim mentioned, we'll have to look at what that means from a trending perspective over the next few years that we'll provide in October. But the opportunity set is there for us to drive efficiency and even offset where we may have to provide buffer stock from a supply chain perspective and things like that. There's always opportunity to drive efficiency in our operations, and that's what we'll be focused on. And don't forget that we will -- we also in that talked about continuing to deliver around 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through the dividend and share repurchase. We remain committed to that, and there will be more to come as far as specifics in October. Good morning. No, that covers it. Yes. Good question, Matt. Very strong performance through the first half of the year in excess of 15%. We do expect it to step back down in the second half of the year. It's primarily due to lower step-ups and some contract mix. And so, we see some just against some of the newer classified programs ramp up. And then we see just the solid performance was really somewhat of an acceleration of good performance into the first half of the year versus the second half. And so that's just going to be a natural decline there.  Having said that, we did -- they are holding their profit in spite of the lower revenue outlook. And so, their margins are going up relative to what we thought coming into the year. So, we'll kind of -- we'll watch them because their performance has been solid, if anything, maybe there's a little bit of upside there. But again, it's just a function of the timing of what we see in terms of visibility to step up changes to profit rate adjustments and in the program contract mix."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I'll begin today by welcoming Jay Malave to our executive management team. Many of you have worked with Jay during his two-decade-plus career in the aerospace and defense industry and know him to be an exceptional financial professional and an outstanding leader. We're excited to have Jay join our company. On a personal level, I'm extremely pleased to be working with him. I'd also like to recognize John Mollard, he's with us today for his tremendous contributions as our acting CFO. We're grateful to John for his leadership and financial acumen, and he's continued as a key member of our team, leading our treasury organization. Moving to our financials. Jay will discuss our first quarter results and 2022 outlook in detail in a few moments, but I'll begin with a brief overview. Our first quarter sales were slightly below our expectations. However, our full year 2022 outlook remains intact. We did experience some adverse impacts from the winter surge and the Omicron variant in our operations and our supply chain, but we expect these to reflect short-term timing issues. I'm proud of how our team responded to these challenges, and we remain committed to delivering all the objectives that we laid out in our January outlook. Our operational performance was solid, with our business areas delivering increased profit margins from last year's first quarter and free cash flow was ahead of our projections. We also progressed well on our cash deployment plan, executing a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement during the quarter. We are well on our way to achieving our full year outlook of $4 billion in repurchases as we look to deliver over 100% of our free cash flow to stockholders over the course of the year inclusive of dividends. We will continue to execute on our long-term strategy of disciplined and dynamic capital deployment, growing free cash flow per share and thereby delivering strong long-term returns to shift to shareholders. Turning to the F-35 program. Germany recently announced their intent to procure 35 aircraft. Lockheed Martin will support our U.S. government Joint Program Office in this process, as we look to partner with Germany to provide this unique capacity and capability for its national defense. The government of Canada has also announced it will enter into the finalization phase of their procurement process with the United States government and Lockheed Martin to purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets for the Royal Canadian Air Force. Canada is one of the original eight partner countries on the F-35 program, and we're very pleased to have the opportunity to provide this unrivaled plane to strengthen Canada's national defense. The German and Canadian announcements followed similar award decisions last year from Switzerland and Finland. And these four competitive wins have the potential to add 223 F-35s to our backlog when all are finalized. All four of these recent announcements underscore that the F-35 fighter jet remains the most capable, survivable and highly connected platform in production as well as the best value available today for our war fighters. And although the initial quantity of F-35 is requested in the FY23 President's budget submission was below our expectations for lot 17 aircraft, we expect that the services adds via the unfunded priority list and increased international demand will enable us to deliver on the stabilized production profile we had previously established. With respect to the overall Department of Defense budgets, this quarter, Congress passed the fiscal year 2022 Omnibus Appropriations Act, with strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, and the bill was subsequently signed into law by President Biden. This legislation improved approximately $742 billion in DoD spending, an increase of nearly $40 billion over the FY21 enacted amount. The final bill resulted in increases that will benefit multiple Lockheed Martin programs over the next few years, including fully funding 85 F-35s, 21 additional C-130J transport aircraft, 10 additional Black Hawks, 2 additional CH-53K helicopters as well as increases to some of our franchise satellite and missile programs. This quarter, the President also submitted the fiscal year 2023 Defense Department budget request, the first step in the FY23 budget process. The President\u2019s submission added an additional $30 billion to the enacted FY22 appropriations and totaled $773 billion in requested DoD funding. This initial budget submission continues the administration's emphasis on the Indo-Pacific region, it supports Ukraine and focuses on strengthening our nation\u2019s deterrence capabilities, all initiatives that are well aligned with our portfolio and with our 21st Century security The DoD also expanded investments in important technology development efforts such as Future Vertical Lift and hypersonics. Also key elements in our multi-pillar growth strategy, and we look forward to providing our customers with innovative solutions for these and other important missions. On a related note, I'd like to take a few moments to bring you up to date on two of the four pillars in our long-term growth strategy, our programs of record and new business opportunities. As to programs of record, this quarter, our Sikorsky team received over $1 billion in orders for the CH-53K platform, one of the main contributors in our program of record growth pillar. These announcements included awards for 13 low-rate initial production lot 6 aircraft, including 4 for Israel as well as long lead time items for full rate production lot 7 helicopters. The program is performing very well and as it continues to inflection to full production, we anticipate tripling our deliveries in the next few years. We also continue to see significant opportunities across the competitive new business landscape. Beginning with our space business area, we are very excited to be awarded transport layer tranche 1, one of three prototype agreements from the Space Development Agency. The $700 million award to design and build 42 small low-earth orbit satellites as part of the initial tranche of the National Defense Space Architecture. This transport layer constellation will connect assets in space with platforms and other domains in a highly capable mesh network environment for joint all-domain operations. And it's an outstanding example of 5G.MIL enabled JADO technology, maturing into a program of record. This award built on our current Tranche 0 contract that will deliver 10 space vehicles later this year, and we look forward to continuing our support to the SDA and the development of our country's next-generation space architecture. Continuing with competitive new business activity, in March, our Sikorsky team delivered our final updated prime proposal to the U.S. Army in response to their future long-range assault aircraft solicitation. Several weeks ago, we flew our DEFIANT aircraft 700 nautical miles from West Palm Beach to Nashville to be displayed at the Annual Army Aviation Association of America Conference. That was completing a 7-hour mission that further demonstrated the capabilities and the maturity of this remarkable rotorcraft. We believe our DEFIANT offering is the most mission-capable platform available, one that will provide our soldiers with transformational capabilities and unparalleled maneuverability, and we're excited to offer this unique solution in support of our armed forces. Before I hand the call over to Jay, I'd like to take a moment to express my sincere sympathy for those affected by the Russian government's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The conflict has resulted in devastating impact to the Ukrainian people and heightened security threats for the European continent. While we hope that this conflict is resolved peacefully soon, Lockheed Martin is taking steps to help address the resultant humanitarian crisis through multiple partners. These include committing aid to the Polish Red Cross, Project HOPE, USO and others to provide assistance to refugees, and we will continue to support ongoing relief efforts in Eastern Europe. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later to answer your questions.\nJay Malave: Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the introduction, and it's an honor to be part of the Lockheed Martin team and represent our 114,000 employees on the first quarter earnings call. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results, business area detail and discuss our 2022 outlook. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated first quarter results. As reported in our earnings release, results were largely in line with our expectations as the first quarter was impacted by program life cycle transitions. In addition to the expected program effects, we also saw some impacts to sales timing, mostly due to the spike in COVID early in Q1. Total segment operating profit was $1.7 billion, and segment operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 11.1%. Earnings per share were $6.44, and we delivered $1.1 billion of free cash flow. We also got off to a strong start to this year's capital allocation program, with $2 billion of shares repurchased in the quarter at an average price of approximately $427 per share. Along with almost $800 million in dividends paid, we returned greater than 2 times our free cash flow to stockholders. And we remain committed to our full year outlook. Turning to consolidated sales and segment operating profit results on chart 4. Total sales declined by 8%, mostly reflecting anticipated program reductions, with about 1.5 points coming from supply chain and internal operations delays, primarily associated with the recent COVID surge. Our operations and supply chain teams did a strong job of managing this latest challenge, and we expect these timing impacts to be recovered over the course of 2022. Segment operating profit declined 5% versus last year, and our segment operating margins expanded 30 basis points to 11.1%, reflecting solid underlying performance in spite of lower net profit adjustments versus last year. Turning to segment sales on chart 5. Three of our four business areas affected by expected program life cycle timing. Space declined by approximately $450 million due to the nationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment program. Rotary and Mission Systems sales were also lower, driven by approximately $300 million from the delivery of an Australian pilot training program in last year's first quarter as well as other mission system program transitions and COVID-related timing impacts. And Missiles and Fire Control was lower due to supply chain delays in integrated air and missile defense, reduced sustainment revenue for special ops following the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, and program transitions in the tactical and strike missile business. Aeronautics was flat this quarter as expected, with increased F-16 production offsetting lower volume on F-35. Moving to segment operating profit on chart 6. Operating margins were higher at space and MFC with the increase in space driven by additional ULA equity earnings, and MFC expansion from solid program performance and successful contract negotiations on an international program. Both aero and RMS margins contracted, primarily due to lower net profit adjustment, but they met or exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Overall, solid performance across the operations. Turning to earnings per share on chart 7. Our first quarter EPS of $6.44 declined by 2% and reflected the impact of decreased sales volume, mark-to-market adjustments and lower FAS/CAS income, partially offset by benefits from the increased segment operating margin, reduced share count and a lower tax rate. Shifting to first quarter cash generation and deployment on chart 8. Free cash flow of $1.1 billion was ahead of our expectations, following the very strong $3.7 billion of free cash flow generated during the fourth quarter of 2021. Cash deployment continued to drive value for our stockholders as we returned $2 billion through share repurchases, leaving approximately $2 billion on our existing authorization and outlook for 2022. Combined with nearly $800 million in dividends paid, we returned over 240% of free cash flow to shareholders this quarter. Operational cash remains solid as the business looks to grow quarter-over-quarter through the rest of 2022. Okay. Moving over to our 2022 outlook on chart 9. We remain confident in our full year outlook as we have seen improvements since the Omicron variant spike. Our first quarter sales were approximately $250 million below our expectations, which equates to less than a single day of volume, and we expect this to be fully recouped throughout 2022. For the balance of the year, we project sales of slightly below $16 billion in the second quarter, around $17 billion in the third quarter and $18 billion in the fourth quarter. As our release stated, our outlook does not include any impacts from potential debt refinance or pension liability transfer actions that are currently under evaluation. On chart 10, and we break out our segment sales and operating profit outlook. Our segment estimates for 2022 remain consistent with the guidance we provided in January, and we continue to anticipate long-term growth for all four of our business areas. It's important to note that our consolidated and aero outlooks are dependent upon reaching agreement on F-35 lots 15 through 17 here in the second quarter, as funding constraints would likely cause a timing impact to our financial results beginning this quarter. Our teams are diligently working with their Joint Program Office counterparts to achieve closure on this critical milestone and both parties are striving to finish negotiations in the near term. So, we remain confident in our full year projections. Okay. To bring it all together on chart 11. The first quarter delivered solid operational performance that was largely in line with our expectations in spite of the effects of the recent COVID spikes. Our cash generation and deployment also got off to a good start with a focus on strategic investment for growth and fulfilling our capital allocation outlook for the year. Our solid performance and our four-pillar growth strategy have us well positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value. So with that, John, let's open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And first, we go to line of Rob Spingarn with Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Spingarn: Well, good morning, Jim and Jay. It's good to see you again.\nJay Malave: Thank you, Rob. It's great to have you covering the Company and the industry again. Welcome back.\nRob Spingarn: Thank you. Jim, I wanted to ask you if we could discuss Eastern Europe a little bit more. And I know it's early, but perhaps we can expand on your earlier comments and discuss in more detail the potential impact for Lockheed. So, to start, I'm thinking of incremental demand for longer-range weapons that the U.S. is now talking about for Ukraine, but also the F-35, the F-16 and other products at MFC, both domestically and for allied nations. So, in terms of specifics, what products are most relevant? And at a higher level, how do we think about this influencing organic top line growth over time, say, the next five years, rest of the decade?\nJim Taiclet: Sure, Rob. Let me just start by articulating the foundations of what we think we're facing as a company and a country and an alliance, given the circumstances. The world's clearly changed with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A major global power has crossed a recognized international border to take territory by force. And as a result, the value of strong deterrents to war as an instrument of nation's geopolitical strategy has not been as great since the middle of the 20th century. So, here at Lockheed Martin, we're aggressively and have been aggressively positioning our company as a deterrence company. Using the F-35 and our other core platforms as pathfinders, we're developing an open architecture using 21st Century digital technologies to continually enhance the deterrent effect of our national and our Allied Defense enterprise. And we have an integrated strategy to do so. I mean, I'll talk about a couple of platforms in a minute. But it's really about the integrated strategy and its ability to enhance deterrents as we go forward, every -- not 6 to 10 years with a new platform, but while we're doing the new platforms every 6 to 12 months in parallel. So, across Lockheed Martin, we're integrating our own business areas to be able to deliver on this idea and this vision. We're also integrating our strategy as a company across the U.S. and toward its allies, so they can work together more closely and effectively over time and ultimately, across the defense and aerospace industry and commercial technology industry as well, so we can accelerate those 21st Century digital technologies that others are investing a lot of time and talent in to, like 5G, AI, distributed cloud computing, et cetera. So, it's more about the strategy and what we can deliver in total as a company and maybe as a pathfinder for our industry. So, some of the platforms you mentioned fit really well into this strategy. The F-35, for example, you led off with. My interactions with pilots and commanders and senior government officials in countries, including the U.S. and Israel, and in Europe, where the F-35 has been used in either combat or combat support operations. The feedback is the aircraft is unmatched as an aircraft, especially with its fifth-generation stealth capability and be survivable in a really hostile environment. But equally exciting to the people I\u2019ve been getting feedback from on the front, so to speak, is the ability of the F-35 to be a core sensor and a core command node and control node in a much wider network of national defense or deterrence. And so, the sensing capability of the F-35, combined with its aspects and kind of a 5G.MIL perspective as it's got -- and we'll have even bigger but it's got the largest data storage capacity of any fighter aircraft. It's got the greatest store data processing capacity on board of any fighter aircraft that we know of. And it's also got the best connectivity and sensor suite back to the command and control network into other platforms. And that really is the essence of what we mean by 5G.MIL. So, as you see, the F-35 has already become a more important platform, I guess, I'd say post Ukraine, unfortunately. And that is with Germany, seemingly moving from one direction to another toward the F-35 for its nuclear mission, responsibilities in Europe. Also, with Canada selection, of course, they\u2019re part of NORAD as well and the integration, both in Europe and there and even in Asia, will be enhanced with F-35, and we expect that -- again, the services are asking for more airplanes beyond the President's request as well. So, the F-35 has been called by Chief Brown as the quarterback of the U.S. Air Force future strategy because of all those capabilities I talked about. So, that's part and parcel and really kind of the lead pinnacle, so to speak, of our strategy, and it actually fits in really, really well with integrated deterrents, which is the same concept that Secretary Austin has been developing with his team. You mentioned F-16. It's a great affordable 4.5 generation airplane when you take the Block 60 and 70 avionics and you marry them up with a proven -- an aircraft like the F-16. It's an earlier and more affordable way to get our allies on board with us so that we can integrate them into our 5G.MIL system. And then, the other effectors that you talked about, long-range precision strike weapons and long-range defensive weapons like THAAD and PAC-3 are going to be probably in greater demand as we move through time. So, all those are the trends that strategy that I outlined is meant to really ensure that we can defend against what's going on in the environment of the country in alliance. But it's the future out-year revenue growth for Lockheed Martin, it's too early to say, and we're not yet in a position to attempt to quantify that. But we'll update you as we proceed forward, Rob, every quarter as to what our expectations are in the current period. But we'll also update you on where we see these trends going. But I think this is the right set of platforms and the right strategy to enhance and preserve Lockheed Martin's leadership in the defense and aerospace industry.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: So, can we talk about the F-35 some more, maybe what's going on with negotiations, what exactly is the hold up? And then, when we think about the fiscal '23 request of 61, how does that relate to production? And how do we think about international orders being feathered in when we think about 156 units produced overall?\nJim Taiclet: Sheila, it's Jim. I'll start off and maybe turn it over to Jay for some more of the detail. But we're very confident in our ability to reach an agreement with the Joint Program Office in the U.S. government on our negotiations that are ongoing. But what's really important to us and for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders, is that we have a clear and shared understanding of the changes in the cost environment of the aircraft that have occurred over the last 12 months or so during this negotiation. And two of the biggest cost drivers in the upward direction are inflation and COVID effects that have actually been ongoing over the past couple of years. And so, we need and feel it's very, very important to take all those costs into consideration, make sure that there's a joint agreement on what those costs are and the magnitude of those, so that we can have a successful program for everyone in lot 15 to 17. There's also, as we touched on earlier, some lower quantities that were initially projected for that lot. We're working with the U.S. government and also the -- our international partners to see if there's ways to bolster that number. But right now, what we're working with is a lower number in negotiations. So, when you add all those things together, it's incumbent upon us to make sure we get an appropriate transaction or agreement for our shareholders and for the U.S. government and for our workforce as well. So, that's what the -- I wouldn't call it a holdup. I would just say that's the reality of the situation, and we're working closely and constructively with our government customers to collect on to that cost baseline and then we'll work from there on the contract.\nJay Malave: Jim, let me just add on a little bit. As far as the negotiation, Sheila, we're encouraged by the progress being made. There has been progress, and we're encouraged by that. As far as an acute impact, it could be $500 million plus in the quarter, which we'd expect to be timing that we would recover in the balance of the year, assuming a successful negotiation. There does remain a gap, and Jim alluded to that. The team has been working with a sense of urgency to really complete this negotiation. And again, as Jim mentioned, it's important to keep in mind that we need to reach the right agreement for our stakeholders, even if that means we have to endure some impacts in the short term. As far as the production question. I mean, we're pretty confident in the 156 three-year plan that we had laid out before from a delivery profile. As you mentioned, the international customers and these customers that Jim just mentioned in his prepared remarks, provide some level of flexibility to really shore up that production schedule. You may have seen in the unfunded priority list for the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines, there was about 19 aircraft added to that. So, when you mix that in with the international demand, we feel very comfortable in our ability to maintain a 156 production cycle over that three-year period.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ron Epstein with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: In the investment community, it seems like there's this assumption. I'm just going to lay this out here and that Textron is going to win Future Vertical Lift. And I'm curious from your point of view, why you don't think that is the case? And I mean, if you could walk through for all of us on the call, the pluses and minuses of a layout like defiance got over valor? I mean you've got counter-rotating helicopters, what do you get with that that you don't get for the tilt rotor and vice versa?\nJim Taiclet: Ron, it's Jim. I'm an ex Air Force Aviator, maybe I can start off and Jay can add to it if he\u2019d like. I've experienced this pretty close hand, and I've been involved in special ops helicopters, not as a pilot, but as a partner in my prior life a long time ago. What's most important to people that have to fly helicopters into hot landing zones is maneuverability and an ability to get into close quarters, let's say, into a landing zone surrounded by trees onto a rooftop in a crowded urban environment, things like that. And I would -- because I've seen the aircraft fly, I've flown the Matrix myself, which is our tech demonstrator in S-92, up in Stratford. That is the war fighter advantage, the maneuverability of the dual rotor X technology is head and shoulders above anything you could ever do with a tilt rotor. And the second question then would be, well, what about the speed -- max speed and sort of horizontal flight, if you will, cruise. We've got our aircraft up to over 230 knots, I believe, at this point. There's probably some upside to that. And that is not the differentiator. Getting the aircraft, the 100 miles that you need to go from base to target, 2 minutes faster is irrelevant versus when you get to the target, are you going to survive and live through that mission? And that's the differential. I think if it's war fighters and commanders making this decision, the only one they can make is future vertical out of Sikorsky and Boeing. Jay, anything else to add?\nJay Malave: No, I think that was well said. I think that's it.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Rich Safran with Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nRich Safran: So, I recognize you don't want to get out in front of the government on this, but I thought you might comment on what the FY23 request says about growth this year and next year and your prior expectations for $8.1 billion in cash from ops for '23. I just have to believe that the request as it stands, was above the assumptions you used when you gave out your 2023 estimate. So, if they requested -- if we take a standpoint that if the request is enacted just as is. Does that alter how you're thinking about 2023 growth and your cash from ops guide?\nJay Malave: Let me take that question first. The budget was beneficial. I think as Jim mentioned, the trends are favorable, directionally, it's moving in the right way. And again, you would expect it to be incremental from the low single-digit baseline that we had previously provided. And maybe a little bit of color you've seen in a lot of reference to integrated deterrents emphasis on all domain and interoperability. And there's quite a few things from a programmatic standpoint to be excited about things like nuclear command control and communications reentry -- future reentry vehicle systems, our TACAMO recapitalizations, Next-Gen Interceptor, Next-Gen OPIR and others. And so, directionally, as I mentioned, it feels pretty good. As Jim had mentioned, we're still compiling this, and we're going through the analysis. It's going to take us some time to work through exactly what that means from an impact. I think it's fair to say that it's beneficial. It's biased to the upside, the extent to which they'll really have to work through and at the appropriate time, we'll let you know what that is.\nOperator: Our next question is from Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Maybe following up on Rob's earlier question, I understand that it's too early to provide long-term outlook with regards to Ukraine. But, can you give more color in terms of the nearest term opportunities for you? I mean, Germany has announced a $100 billion modernization of its armed forces. And as our allies step up spending for defense, how meaningful is this opportunity for you? And in addition to F-35, should there be opportunities that we should watch for in missile and missile defense?\nJim Taiclet: So Kristine, this is Jim. And obviously, we're in a long-cycle business here from an authorization in the House Armed Services Committee, for example, to book of revenue -- booking of revenue at Lockheed Martin could be 12 months to 3 years, depending on the program. So, I think -- as I tried to lay out, the environment is more challenging from a security -- national security and global security perspective than it was before. That suggests that deterrence is a more valuable product than it's ever been, at least in the last 80 to 100 years, and that we feel we're really positioned well with our strategy to meet that need for national security and global security. But we can't quantify yet exactly how that's going to touch our revenue on a $66 billion base, for example. And until we get actual contracts that have order schedules and we get the funding to do the long lead time items and all of those nuances and specifics in defense contracting. So, we're not going to try to bracket what those growth numbers are going to be, because we want to keep the fidelity of our guidance process. And we give it a year at a time. I did that in my last company, too, because that's where we have real data upon which we can give you a reliable forecast.\nJay Malave: Yes. I'll just add, Kristine, that there are conversations ongoing with our government customer, to Jim's point, and sensitivity analysis, scenario planning and things like that. And as those firm up, we'll provide clearer information to you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: So, if we could return to the F-35 contract negotiation. So, your major subcontractor took a $93 million hit because of delays related to COVID, you mentioned that COVID is an issue. I understand that LHX is still kind of working through the software, and you've been at this with the government for, what, three quarters trying to negotiate this. So, I guess, the question is, I assume you will reach an agreement. But basically, will this result in a profit hit? And secondly, if you don't reach an agreement in the second quarter, what's the incremental impact likely to be?\nJay Malave: Kai, so at this point, we would not expect any type of profit hit based on our negotiation as it currently stands. And again, it's a dynamic discussion, but we wouldn't expect any type of charge there. Going forward, as I mentioned here, the impact would be up $500 million plus in the second quarter. To further extent, obviously, that will go up. I think that we'll probably have to revisit later in the quarter to see how things are progressing. And I think we can update accordingly then. I think let's just kind of get through the quarter. We're encouraged and really pleased with the progress we're making to date. I know it's been a long road, but there's been some significant progress that's been made. And so, we're encouraged that we can be able to close this in a relatively short period of time. If not, then we'll update you accordingly at that point in time.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. And remember, during the negotiation period, we've had significant changes in the underlying cost factors of bidding for the next three lots. And again, those -- it was concurrent. So, yes, we've been going at this for a number of quarters, but that's because that cost baseline has been moving during that time, and we both have to agree on where we think it's going to end up. And so, COVID impacts was cited and inflation, which is even a more recent phenomenon, so to speak. We've got to go all the way back to our supply chain, see what the impacts are going to be, then present that to the government. They have to vet those estimates and those cost assumptions. And that's what the basis of the negotiation to follow. So, this has been longer than normal because the underlying ground has been shifting on the most important assumptions that go into the negotiation. We are going to stay with our strategy, which is constructive, which they are, and progressing negotiations on the basis of actual cost information and data that provides our shareholders a fair margin and return as well as a government attractive contract.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Seth Seifman with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: I wanted to ask a little bit about capital deployment. And I think you mentioned kind of similar to prior guidance, but you talk about the buyback plan or capital deployment overall being dynamic. And so, the share price has changed. I think, Jay, you mentioned some potential items having to do with the pension or debt repayment. So, maybe you could talk about how you're thinking about things differently and how the dynamic aspect of that has changed versus three months ago, if at all?\nJim Taiclet: I can start with the theory and turn it over to Jay for the practice. The theory I have on capital deployment is what\u2019s some highest and best use every quarter of the dollars that are created by the company or that we could or should be borrowing from the capital markets. And the batting order for me here kind of continues from my prior experience, which is based on regression data on when we make decisions, how they turn out. And what's the best ROIC that we can expect for a given dollar of investment or a given $100 million of investment? It tends to have been in my experience in both, this and other companies that capital investments based on actual or anticipated contracts with real customers, tend to have the highest ROICs. And we've bolstered our CapEx budget and plans under John's leadership and now Jay's as well at Lockheed Martin because we've got good prospects for contracts we're winning that are going into production that we need to invest in. The other thing we've done and really stepped up our internal spending on and we expect to get good returns from is our digital transformation program which I would say really is in the major leads right now, frankly. We've got a great CIO running it. She's got a fantastic team. We have a well-thought-out plan. We have support from our Board to go do this on a multiyear basis. And it's going to make us more efficient, more competitive and higher quality products coming out of our plants. So those are -- that's the first area. Our highest ROIC tends to be in universe, so to speak. Second area I found to be most beneficial is inorganic investments, right? So, we're looking at really hard now, making investments in both, the U.S. and other countries in technologies and programs we think are going to have duration and traction. And again, some of those will be in the U.S. and some will be outside the U.S. I think you'll see us investing a little more by putting, say, let's call it, boots on -- and brick-and-mortar on the ground and other countries than we have in the past because we expect those ROIs to be pretty compelling. When it comes down to what's left, M&A tends to be the third in the batting order. That doesn't seem to be really wide open in our industry right now with the current administration. So, we're going to then look to what else can we do and it's share repurchases, the next thing in the batting order. And you've seen us step up to that as far as announcements and performance already this year. And if we've got excess capital, and we are at a reasonable leverage level, we'll go ahead and continue to buy back shares. And I'll let Jay talk about intrinsic value and how we weave that in. But we're going to put our capital to work, the cash flow we generate and what we can borrow and maybe even lever up if those opportunities with high ROICs get bigger than we thought.\nJay Malave: Let me just add -- let me just clarify, Seth, in terms of the debt. We don't plan on delevering. It would be just refinancing what we have. And so, the existing capacity we have really doesn't change at all. The use of the cash wouldn't change either. It's just taking multi -- potentially multiple years and refinancing that in various tranches here and doing it efficiently. As far as the prioritization of our capital, I agree wholeheartedly with what Jim just laid out. And so, we're going to go through that evaluation process. Keep in mind, I've been with the Company about 2.5 months now. And so, I would just ask for a little bit of time for us to just go through this process deliberately and analytically so that we can make the best decisions. If you look at the industry, we've seen an uptick in valuations in the industry as a whole. But I would say, our stock still remains undervalued on a relative basis. And from an intrinsic value, we're just -- we're going through that whole analysis right now. Based on some of the questions you asked, really taking another look at our growth outlook in determining what that comes up from a value for the company. So, we're going to go through that. We're going to be deliberate about it and then make the best decisions from a capital deployment. The key here is that we've got plenty of flexibility and plenty of opportunity, and we won't be afraid to use it. Ultimately, what we want to do is get to sustainable growth in free cash flow per share, and that's what our objective is.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to David Strauss with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: So, I wanted to follow up on this, thinking about the growth outlook beyond '22. So, I think previously, you had said 2% revenue growth in '23, a little bit of acceleration beyond and that was based on $715 billion fiscal '22 budget with $245 billion in modernization that we got $740 billion and $265 billion. It sounds like F-35 you think can kind of hold in there with the plan that was in place when you talked about 2% growth. So I mean, can you quantify at all how much potential acceleration we could be looking at above and beyond that 2%? And is there anything that got worse from a program standpoint as you think about that beyond fiscal -- beyond 2022 outlook?\nJay Malave: Thanks for the question, David. Let me just maybe put it in a little bit of context, and remind you, in Jim's comments, we are a long-cycle business. So, benefits that you may see in a particular budget year manifest themselves and get delivered from a revenue standpoint over multiple years. And the best example I can give you is the -- 2022 plus-ups. If you look at the plus-ups and the impacts to us, that was about a little bit over 2 points of growth in any given year. But the reality is the profile -- delivery profile of that revenue stream is going to be over 3 to 4 years. And so, it's going be spread over. And so, as we just had an opportunity to have this presidential budget dropped, we're in the first inning here. We need to see -- let the process play out and get a better understanding in terms of what these program increments mean to us and in what periods. And so, we're just going to need some time to really go through that. And as I mentioned before, we'll obviously keep you updated at the appropriate time, but it's just a little early to really make those calls right now.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Peter Arment with Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Hey. Jim, you coming into this year, you always have a kind of a long list of international pursuits in terms of potential international awards. Maybe you could just remind us some of the bigger ones that Lockheed is focused on and maybe any of the timing around that, that would be appreciated? Thanks.\nJim Taiclet: Sure. Well, we've got, as you've seen, a lot of success on the F-35. We also have international F-16 interest that's increasing. CH-53K is on the table in, say, Germany, for example. So, there's an across-the-board interest in these products, THAAD and PAC-3. Middle East has got to defend itself against missiles being fired at oil and gas infrastructure and even worse for populated major cities. And so, those kind of products have high demand in that part of the world and others as well.\nJay Malave: Peter, I'll just add -- I mean, F-35 Lot 15 to 16, orders we expect, those are -- actually, they will have some international volumes associated with those big numbers this year, and those will really move the dial. We've got Black Hawk Multi-Year X, which is a multibillion-dollar award as well. And we didn't really talk about it here in the first quarter results, but we had about a $4 billion award in our classified. And if you recall, it's one of our pillars of growth here in the first quarter. So, very excited about that program as well. And so, we're positioned pretty well for award growth for the balance of the year and heading into next year.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Matt Akers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMatt Akers: There's a line in your release that I think is new with the outlook on potential pension risk transfer and refinancing transactions you may do as early as Q2. I was wondering if you could talk about what some of those are? And what kind of impact those might have on your results this year?\nJim Taiclet: Sure, Matt. The first one is just the transfer of pension, what you've seen us do over the last few years. This is essentially matching assets and liabilities and having insurance, transferring these over to insurance companies from a liability management perspective. And so, we're contemplating doing another round of those. On the debt, it's just a matter of taking multiple years of debt and really refinancing that out just a little bit earlier than waiting for the maturities to occur in each particular year. And so, those may have some P&L impacts associated with them. Last year, we had a pretty sizable impact on the pension liability transfer I don't have that in front of me. We're still working through that right now. But just to say that those may happen here as early as in the second quarter, just to give you the heads up about that.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.\nPete Skibitski: Jim, you touched on this, but getting back to fiscal '23 and congressional support for defense budgets. When the administration came out with its request for '23, it admitted it hadn't really taken Ukraine into account because of timing. And obviously, we saw the congressional support in '22. So, I'm wondering if you have a sense of how additive to the budget to the request that Congress may be in '23? Because it seems like there's more broader support than there was even a couple of years ago.\nJim Taiclet: Sure, Pete. Look, I'd like just to go back to the environment we're in. I think it's pretty evident leadership in Congress and the key committees, of course, are well aware of this environment. And they have points of view on what the defense budget ought to look like to meet that environment, and then, the specifics underneath that. So, for me to get ahead of them at this point is really not our place. But if you look in historical terms, recent or beyond, Congress does have a point of view in these matters and tends to take their own actions because they are the authorizers and appropriators at the end of the day, and they'll have a voice. But I can't predict what that outcome is going to be in a quantitative fashion yet.\nOperator: Next, we'll go to Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: If I'm correct on the profit adjustments, not related to volume, if you correct for those EACs, the underlying booking rate was about 8.4%. I think that's the highest I've ever seen for you guys in quarter. So, two questions. One, did you adjust or lift the underlying booking rates systematically, or is this more just a reflection of favorable mix happening in the quarter?\nJay Malave: I'd say, it's a combination of both, Myles. You're pretty close to that underlying recurring margin percentage. If you think about it, last year was a pretty good size year as far as net profit positive adjustments. And as you would expect, those carry forward into higher run rate margins moving forward as you recognize revenue. And so, part of it is also mixes plays in the game as well. But I would expect what you saw in the first quarter to generally be what we'll see for the balance of the year. And so, we expect our profit adjustments to be lower year-over-year. Last year, we did about 28% of our profit. This year, in the first quarter, we did about 24%. For the full year, we're expecting that to be closer to 25%. And so -- but again, it's -- we're very comfortable with our margin outlook. We're very comfortable with our EPS outlook, and we're just seeing a little bit of a transition here with recurring versus margins versus the profit adjustments.\nOperator: And next, we'll go to George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Jay, if you look at your guide for the second quarter of $16 billion in revenues, it's down $1 billion, if you adjusted the first quarter for the $300 million nonrecurring benefit you had at MST, it was also down $1 billion. So, why won't the second quarter be a little better in terms of relative to last year, particularly when it seems like Omicron is somewhat going away?\nJay Malave: That's a good question, George. Look, the second quarter would have us down around 7% year-over-year, and so we'd be down around that ballpark for the first half of the year. We're still -- while it's still a dynamic environment, I guess, is the best way to describe it. And we're still dealing -- even though we've seen significant improvement since the beginning of the year is still we're not out of the woods. And so, we're holding it there. We would still expect to have some level of impact that will clear itself up in the back half of the year. And that's really the placeholder for that second quarter number. We still are dealing with through the first half of the year, the impact of the Atomic Weapons Establishment program from the UK. And so, it's just -- year-over-year compares are tough. It is sequentially a pretty big step-up. You're talking $1 billion nearly, around that ballpark. And we think that's the right place to be for the moment. And of course, if anything changes, we'll update you accordingly.\nOperator: And we'll go to Rob Stallard with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Stallard: This might be a question for Jim. There's been a lot of discussion about whether defense in an ESG construct now looks different. I was wondering what your perspective might be on this and whether you've seen any shareholders or new shareholders are coming on to the register as things have been changing?\nJim Taiclet: Sure, Rob. I mean, my personal view of this having been an aviator in military myself is that you can't really have an effective economy and protect human rights if authoritarian governments are not constrained in what they might do and how they might do it, frankly. So, I would put that national security and human security notion up equally with other ESG topics like corporate governance and global warming, climate change, which are also very important. But I'd put it in the same category. I recognize in Europe that before Ukraine occurred that that was not necessarily the trend. But, we've seen some increased interest from our international investors around the world because I think people are starting to recognize that this is not an anti-ESG industry. You could call it neutral or positive perhaps. But we're trying to maintain the conditions where people can live safe, happy, lives and the economy can flourish, especially a free market economy.\nOperator: And we'll go to Doug Harned with Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDoug Harned: Last year, you did more than $2 billion in Missiles and Fire Control in the Middle East. And certainly, the Middle East was a critical area over the course of the Trump administration in THAAD, PAC-3. But now we haven't seen as much activity. How do you see the trajectory going forward in terms of Missiles and Fire Control in the Middle East from here?\nJim Taiclet: I'm not sure a regional approach is the right way to look at it. We've got demand signals for THAAD and PAC-3 from around the world because, again, countries everywhere are recognizing that, especially when you see missiles hitting hospitals and situations like that and train stations in Ukraine, that it's worthwhile to have an effective missile defense capacity in your country. So, we are getting signals that, if anything, we might have to increase capacity in certain products to meet the global demand. So, I'm not sure the regional approach is the best way to look at it. And by the way, that threat hasn't gone down either, it's getting greater instead of lesser, based on what Iran tends to do in that part of the world.\nDoug Harned: Yes. And that's kind of where I was going. Because it does seem like in Europe and Asia, there should be some real -- some strong interest there. So just trying to understand the puts and takes because as you build out -- as you complete a lot of systems in the Middle East, should we expect these other parts of the world to essentially pick up some of that, fill in any gaps there and potentially even add to growth for THAAD, PAC-3 and maybe just assure?\nJim Taiclet: Without the data to quantify it, Doug, you kind of -- I'm a little bit data-driven first. I don't want to speculate on that. But directionally, it sounds something that could come about, frankly. We would expect it in a way, but to quantify it a little too soon.\nJay Malave: Yes. I'll just add, Doug, we are planning on a multiyear up cycle on PAC-3, where this year we'll deliver around 450 units, and that's spiking up to 550. And so, it's well positioned and contemplates some of the things that you've talked about already.\nGreg Gardner: John, this is Greg. I think we've come up at the top of the hour. So, I'll turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\nJim Taiclet: Sure. I'd like to conclude our call today by thanking the entire Lockheed Martin team, all 114,000 people strong for their contributions and dedication, especially over the last many months, where COVID reemerged in the winter, and we still had production to get done, and they did it. Our workforce has performed with the resilience under a lot of challenging circumstances for a long time. And through their ongoing efforts and commitment, our company is now positioned to deliver outstanding technology and solutions for our customers and long-term value to our shareholders. So, I want to thank you all again for joining us on the call today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July.\nGreg Gardner: Thanks, John. That concludes our call for today.\nOperator: You're very welcome. Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2022 earnings call. I'll begin today by welcoming Jay Malave to our executive management team. Many of you have worked with Jay during his two-decade-plus career in the aerospace and defense industry and know him to be an exceptional financial professional and an outstanding leader. We're excited to have Jay join our company. On a personal level, I'm extremely pleased to be working with him. I'd also like to recognize John Mollard, he's with us today for his tremendous contributions as our acting CFO. We're grateful to John for his leadership and financial acumen, and he's continued as a key member of our team, leading our treasury organization. Moving to our financials. Jay will discuss our first quarter results and 2022 outlook in detail in a few moments, but I'll begin with a brief overview. Our first quarter sales were slightly below our expectations. However, our full year 2022 outlook remains intact. We did experience some adverse impacts from the winter surge and the Omicron variant in our operations and our supply chain, but we expect these to reflect short-term timing issues. I'm proud of how our team responded to these challenges, and we remain committed to delivering all the objectives that we laid out in our January outlook. Our operational performance was solid, with our business areas delivering increased profit margins from last year's first quarter and free cash flow was ahead of our projections. We also progressed well on our cash deployment plan, executing a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase agreement during the quarter. We are well on our way to achieving our full year outlook of $4 billion in repurchases as we look to deliver over 100% of our free cash flow to stockholders over the course of the year inclusive of dividends. We will continue to execute on our long-term strategy of disciplined and dynamic capital deployment, growing free cash flow per share and thereby delivering strong long-term returns to shift to shareholders. Turning to the F-35 program. Germany recently announced their intent to procure 35 aircraft. Lockheed Martin will support our U.S. government Joint Program Office in this process, as we look to partner with Germany to provide this unique capacity and capability for its national defense. The government of Canada has also announced it will enter into the finalization phase of their procurement process with the United States government and Lockheed Martin to purchase 88 F-35 fighter jets for the Royal Canadian Air Force. Canada is one of the original eight partner countries on the F-35 program, and we're very pleased to have the opportunity to provide this unrivaled plane to strengthen Canada's national defense. The German and Canadian announcements followed similar award decisions last year from Switzerland and Finland. And these four competitive wins have the potential to add 223 F-35s to our backlog when all are finalized. All four of these recent announcements underscore that the F-35 fighter jet remains the most capable, survivable and highly connected platform in production as well as the best value available today for our war fighters. And although the initial quantity of F-35 is requested in the FY23 President's budget submission was below our expectations for lot 17 aircraft, we expect that the services adds via the unfunded priority list and increased international demand will enable us to deliver on the stabilized production profile we had previously established. With respect to the overall Department of Defense budgets, this quarter, Congress passed the fiscal year 2022 Omnibus Appropriations Act, with strong bipartisan support in both the House and Senate, and the bill was subsequently signed into law by President Biden. This legislation improved approximately $742 billion in DoD spending, an increase of nearly $40 billion over the FY21 enacted amount. The final bill resulted in increases that will benefit multiple Lockheed Martin programs over the next few years, including fully funding 85 F-35s, 21 additional C-130J transport aircraft, 10 additional Black Hawks, 2 additional CH-53K helicopters as well as increases to some of our franchise satellite and missile programs. This quarter, the President also submitted the fiscal year 2023 Defense Department budget request, the first step in the FY23 budget process. The President's submission added an additional $30 billion to the enacted FY22 appropriations and totaled $773 billion in requested DoD funding. This initial budget submission continues the administration's emphasis on the Indo-Pacific region, it supports Ukraine and focuses on strengthening our nation's deterrence capabilities, all initiatives that are well aligned with our portfolio and with our 21st Century security The DoD also expanded investments in important technology development efforts such as Future Vertical Lift and hypersonics. Also key elements in our multi-pillar growth strategy, and we look forward to providing our customers with innovative solutions for these and other important missions. On a related note, I'd like to take a few moments to bring you up to date on two of the four pillars in our long-term growth strategy, our programs of record and new business opportunities. As to programs of record, this quarter, our Sikorsky team received over $1 billion in orders for the CH-53K platform, one of the main contributors in our program of record growth pillar. These announcements included awards for 13 low-rate initial production lot 6 aircraft, including 4 for Israel as well as long lead time items for full rate production lot 7 helicopters. The program is performing very well and as it continues to inflection to full production, we anticipate tripling our deliveries in the next few years. We also continue to see significant opportunities across the competitive new business landscape. Beginning with our space business area, we are very excited to be awarded transport layer tranche 1, one of three prototype agreements from the Space Development Agency. The $700 million award to design and build 42 small low-earth orbit satellites as part of the initial tranche of the National Defense Space Architecture. This transport layer constellation will connect assets in space with platforms and other domains in a highly capable mesh network environment for joint all-domain operations. And it's an outstanding example of 5G.MIL enabled JADO technology, maturing into a program of record. This award built on our current Tranche 0 contract that will deliver 10 space vehicles later this year, and we look forward to continuing our support to the SDA and the development of our country's next-generation space architecture. Continuing with competitive new business activity, in March, our Sikorsky team delivered our final updated prime proposal to the U.S. Army in response to their future long-range assault aircraft solicitation. Several weeks ago, we flew our DEFIANT aircraft 700 nautical miles from West Palm Beach to Nashville to be displayed at the Annual Army Aviation Association of America Conference. That was completing a 7-hour mission that further demonstrated the capabilities and the maturity of this remarkable rotorcraft. We believe our DEFIANT offering is the most mission-capable platform available, one that will provide our soldiers with transformational capabilities and unparalleled maneuverability, and we're excited to offer this unique solution in support of our armed forces. Before I hand the call over to Jay, I'd like to take a moment to express my sincere sympathy for those affected by the Russian government's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. The conflict has resulted in devastating impact to the Ukrainian people and heightened security threats for the European continent. While we hope that this conflict is resolved peacefully soon, Lockheed Martin is taking steps to help address the resultant humanitarian crisis through multiple partners. These include committing aid to the Polish Red Cross, Project HOPE, USO and others to provide assistance to refugees, and we will continue to support ongoing relief efforts in Eastern Europe. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later to answer your questions. Sure, Rob. Let me just start by articulating the foundations of what we think we're facing as a company and a country and an alliance, given the circumstances. The world's clearly changed with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. A major global power has crossed a recognized international border to take territory by force. And as a result, the value of strong deterrents to war as an instrument of nation's geopolitical strategy has not been as great since the middle of the 20th century. So, here at Lockheed Martin, we're aggressively and have been aggressively positioning our company as a deterrence company. Using the F-35 and our other core platforms as pathfinders, we're developing an open architecture using 21st Century digital technologies to continually enhance the deterrent effect of our national and our Allied Defense enterprise. And we have an integrated strategy to do so. I mean, I'll talk about a couple of platforms in a minute. But it's really about the integrated strategy and its ability to enhance deterrents as we go forward, every -- not 6 to 10 years with a new platform, but while we're doing the new platforms every 6 to 12 months in parallel. So, across Lockheed Martin, we're integrating our own business areas to be able to deliver on this idea and this vision. We're also integrating our strategy as a company across the U.S. and toward its allies, so they can work together more closely and effectively over time and ultimately, across the defense and aerospace industry and commercial technology industry as well, so we can accelerate those 21st Century digital technologies that others are investing a lot of time and talent in to, like 5G, AI, distributed cloud computing, et cetera. So, it's more about the strategy and what we can deliver in total as a company and maybe as a pathfinder for our industry. So, some of the platforms you mentioned fit really well into this strategy. The F-35, for example, you led off with. My interactions with pilots and commanders and senior government officials in countries, including the U.S. and Israel, and in Europe, where the F-35 has been used in either combat or combat support operations. The feedback is the aircraft is unmatched as an aircraft, especially with its fifth-generation stealth capability and be survivable in a really hostile environment. But equally exciting to the people I've been getting feedback from on the front, so to speak, is the ability of the F-35 to be a core sensor and a core command node and control node in a much wider network of national defense or deterrence. And so, the sensing capability of the F-35, combined with its aspects and kind of a 5G.MIL perspective as it's got -- and we'll have even bigger but it's got the largest data storage capacity of any fighter aircraft. It's got the greatest store data processing capacity on board of any fighter aircraft that we know of. And it's also got the best connectivity and sensor suite back to the command and control network into other platforms. And that really is the essence of what we mean by 5G.MIL. So, as you see, the F-35 has already become a more important platform, I guess, I'd say post Ukraine, unfortunately. And that is with Germany, seemingly moving from one direction to another toward the F-35 for its nuclear mission, responsibilities in Europe. Also, with Canada selection, of course, they're part of NORAD as well and the integration, both in Europe and there and even in Asia, will be enhanced with F-35, and we expect that -- again, the services are asking for more airplanes beyond the President's request as well. So, the F-35 has been called by Chief Brown as the quarterback of the U.S. Air Force future strategy because of all those capabilities I talked about. So, that's part and parcel and really kind of the lead pinnacle, so to speak, of our strategy, and it actually fits in really, really well with integrated deterrents, which is the same concept that Secretary Austin has been developing with his team. You mentioned F-16. It's a great affordable 4.5 generation airplane when you take the Block 60 and 70 avionics and you marry them up with a proven -- an aircraft like the F-16. It's an earlier and more affordable way to get our allies on board with us so that we can integrate them into our 5G.MIL system. And then, the other effectors that you talked about, long-range precision strike weapons and long-range defensive weapons like THAAD and PAC-3 are going to be probably in greater demand as we move through time. So, all those are the trends that strategy that I outlined is meant to really ensure that we can defend against what's going on in the environment of the country in alliance. But it's the future out-year revenue growth for Lockheed Martin, it's too early to say, and we're not yet in a position to attempt to quantify that. But we'll update you as we proceed forward, Rob, every quarter as to what our expectations are in the current period. But we'll also update you on where we see these trends going. But I think this is the right set of platforms and the right strategy to enhance and preserve Lockheed Martin's leadership in the defense and aerospace industry. Sheila, it's Jim. I'll start off and maybe turn it over to Jay for some more of the detail. But we're very confident in our ability to reach an agreement with the Joint Program Office in the U.S. government on our negotiations that are ongoing. But what's really important to us and for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders, is that we have a clear and shared understanding of the changes in the cost environment of the aircraft that have occurred over the last 12 months or so during this negotiation. And two of the biggest cost drivers in the upward direction are inflation and COVID effects that have actually been ongoing over the past couple of years. And so, we need and feel it's very, very important to take all those costs into consideration, make sure that there's a joint agreement on what those costs are and the magnitude of those, so that we can have a successful program for everyone in lot 15 to 17. There's also, as we touched on earlier, some lower quantities that were initially projected for that lot. We're working with the U.S. government and also the -- our international partners to see if there's ways to bolster that number. But right now, what we're working with is a lower number in negotiations. So, when you add all those things together, it's incumbent upon us to make sure we get an appropriate transaction or agreement for our shareholders and for the U.S. government and for our workforce as well. So, that's what the -- I wouldn't call it a holdup. I would just say that's the reality of the situation, and we're working closely and constructively with our government customers to collect on to that cost baseline and then we'll work from there on the contract. Ron, it's Jim. I'm an ex Air Force Aviator, maybe I can start off and Jay can add to it if he'd like. I've experienced this pretty close hand, and I've been involved in special ops helicopters, not as a pilot, but as a partner in my prior life a long time ago. What's most important to people that have to fly helicopters into hot landing zones is maneuverability and an ability to get into close quarters, let's say, into a landing zone surrounded by trees onto a rooftop in a crowded urban environment, things like that. And I would -- because I've seen the aircraft fly, I've flown the Matrix myself, which is our tech demonstrator in S-92, up in Stratford. That is the war fighter advantage, the maneuverability of the dual rotor X technology is head and shoulders above anything you could ever do with a tilt rotor. And the second question then would be, well, what about the speed -- max speed and sort of horizontal flight, if you will, cruise. We've got our aircraft up to over 230 knots, I believe, at this point. There's probably some upside to that. And that is not the differentiator. Getting the aircraft, the 100 miles that you need to go from base to target, 2 minutes faster is irrelevant versus when you get to the target, are you going to survive and live through that mission? And that's the differential. I think if it's war fighters and commanders making this decision, the only one they can make is future vertical out of Sikorsky and Boeing. Jay, anything else to add? So Kristine, this is Jim. And obviously, we're in a long-cycle business here from an authorization in the House Armed Services Committee, for example, to book of revenue -- booking of revenue at Lockheed Martin could be 12 months to 3 years, depending on the program. So, I think -- as I tried to lay out, the environment is more challenging from a security -- national security and global security perspective than it was before. That suggests that deterrence is a more valuable product than it's ever been, at least in the last 80 to 100 years, and that we feel we're really positioned well with our strategy to meet that need for national security and global security. But we can't quantify yet exactly how that's going to touch our revenue on a $66 billion base, for example. And until we get actual contracts that have order schedules and we get the funding to do the long lead time items and all of those nuances and specifics in defense contracting. So, we're not going to try to bracket what those growth numbers are going to be, because we want to keep the fidelity of our guidance process. And we give it a year at a time. I did that in my last company, too, because that's where we have real data upon which we can give you a reliable forecast. Yes. And remember, during the negotiation period, we've had significant changes in the underlying cost factors of bidding for the next three lots. And again, those -- it was concurrent. So, yes, we've been going at this for a number of quarters, but that's because that cost baseline has been moving during that time, and we both have to agree on where we think it's going to end up. And so, COVID impacts was cited and inflation, which is even a more recent phenomenon, so to speak. We've got to go all the way back to our supply chain, see what the impacts are going to be, then present that to the government. They have to vet those estimates and those cost assumptions. And that's what the basis of the negotiation to follow. So, this has been longer than normal because the underlying ground has been shifting on the most important assumptions that go into the negotiation. We are going to stay with our strategy, which is constructive, which they are, and progressing negotiations on the basis of actual cost information and data that provides our shareholders a fair margin and return as well as a government attractive contract. I can start with the theory and turn it over to Jay for the practice. The theory I have on capital deployment is what's some highest and best use every quarter of the dollars that are created by the company or that we could or should be borrowing from the capital markets. And the batting order for me here kind of continues from my prior experience, which is based on regression data on when we make decisions, how they turn out. And what's the best ROIC that we can expect for a given dollar of investment or a given $100 million of investment? It tends to have been in my experience in both, this and other companies that capital investments based on actual or anticipated contracts with real customers, tend to have the highest ROICs. And we've bolstered our CapEx budget and plans under John's leadership and now Jay's as well at Lockheed Martin because we've got good prospects for contracts we're winning that are going into production that we need to invest in. The other thing we've done and really stepped up our internal spending on and we expect to get good returns from is our digital transformation program which I would say really is in the major leads right now, frankly. We've got a great CIO running it. She's got a fantastic team. We have a well-thought-out plan. We have support from our Board to go do this on a multiyear basis. And it's going to make us more efficient, more competitive and higher quality products coming out of our plants. So those are -- that's the first area. Our highest ROIC tends to be in universe, so to speak. Second area I found to be most beneficial is inorganic investments, right? So, we're looking at really hard now, making investments in both, the U.S. and other countries in technologies and programs we think are going to have duration and traction. And again, some of those will be in the U.S. and some will be outside the U.S. I think you'll see us investing a little more by putting, say, let's call it, boots on -- and brick-and-mortar on the ground and other countries than we have in the past because we expect those ROIs to be pretty compelling. When it comes down to what's left, M&A tends to be the third in the batting order. That doesn't seem to be really wide open in our industry right now with the current administration. So, we're going to then look to what else can we do and it's share repurchases, the next thing in the batting order. And you've seen us step up to that as far as announcements and performance already this year. And if we've got excess capital, and we are at a reasonable leverage level, we'll go ahead and continue to buy back shares. And I'll let Jay talk about intrinsic value and how we weave that in. But we're going to put our capital to work, the cash flow we generate and what we can borrow and maybe even lever up if those opportunities with high ROICs get bigger than we thought. Sure. Well, we've got, as you've seen, a lot of success on the F-35. We also have international F-16 interest that's increasing. CH-53K is on the table in, say, Germany, for example. So, there's an across-the-board interest in these products, THAAD and PAC-3. Middle East has got to defend itself against missiles being fired at oil and gas infrastructure and even worse for populated major cities. And so, those kind of products have high demand in that part of the world and others as well. Sure, Matt. The first one is just the transfer of pension, what you've seen us do over the last few years. This is essentially matching assets and liabilities and having insurance, transferring these over to insurance companies from a liability management perspective. And so, we're contemplating doing another round of those. On the debt, it's just a matter of taking multiple years of debt and really refinancing that out just a little bit earlier than waiting for the maturities to occur in each particular year. And so, those may have some P&L impacts associated with them. Last year, we had a pretty sizable impact on the pension liability transfer I don't have that in front of me. We're still working through that right now. But just to say that those may happen here as early as in the second quarter, just to give you the heads up about that. Sure, Pete. Look, I'd like just to go back to the environment we're in. I think it's pretty evident leadership in Congress and the key committees, of course, are well aware of this environment. And they have points of view on what the defense budget ought to look like to meet that environment, and then, the specifics underneath that. So, for me to get ahead of them at this point is really not our place. But if you look in historical terms, recent or beyond, Congress does have a point of view in these matters and tends to take their own actions because they are the authorizers and appropriators at the end of the day, and they'll have a voice. But I can't predict what that outcome is going to be in a quantitative fashion yet. Sure, Rob. I mean, my personal view of this having been an aviator in military myself is that you can't really have an effective economy and protect human rights if authoritarian governments are not constrained in what they might do and how they might do it, frankly. So, I would put that national security and human security notion up equally with other ESG topics like corporate governance and global warming, climate change, which are also very important. But I'd put it in the same category. I recognize in Europe that before Ukraine occurred that that was not necessarily the trend. But, we've seen some increased interest from our international investors around the world because I think people are starting to recognize that this is not an anti-ESG industry. You could call it neutral or positive perhaps. But we're trying to maintain the conditions where people can live safe, happy, lives and the economy can flourish, especially a free market economy.

And by the way, that threat hasn't gone down either, it's getting greater instead of lesser, based on what Iran tends to do in that part of the world. Without the data to quantify it, Doug, you kind of -- I'm a little bit data-driven first. I don't want to speculate on that. But directionally, it sounds something that could come about, frankly.

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate the introduction, and it's an honor to be part of the Lockheed Martin team and represent our 114,000 employees on the first quarter earnings call. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated results, business area detail and discuss our 2022 outlook. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our consolidated first quarter results. As reported in our earnings release, results were largely in line with our expectations as the first quarter was impacted by program life cycle transitions. In addition to the expected program effects, we also saw some impacts to sales timing, mostly due to the spike in COVID early in Q1. Total segment operating profit was $1.7 billion, and segment operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 11.1%. Earnings per share were $6.44, and we delivered $1.1 billion of free cash flow. We also got off to a strong start to this year's capital allocation program, with $2 billion of shares repurchased in the quarter at an average price of approximately $427 per share. Along with almost $800 million in dividends paid, we returned greater than 2 times our free cash flow to stockholders. And we remain committed to our full year outlook. Turning to consolidated sales and segment operating profit results on chart 4. Total sales declined by 8%, mostly reflecting anticipated program reductions, with about 1.5 points coming from supply chain and internal operations delays, primarily associated with the recent COVID surge. Our operations and supply chain teams did a strong job of managing this latest challenge, and we expect these timing impacts to be recovered over the course of 2022. Segment operating profit declined 5% versus last year, and our segment operating margins expanded 30 basis points to 11.1%, reflecting solid underlying performance in spite of lower net profit adjustments versus last year. Turning to segment sales on chart 5. Three of our four business areas affected by expected program life cycle timing. Space declined by approximately $450 million due to the nationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment program. Rotary and Mission Systems sales were also lower, driven by approximately $300 million from the delivery of an Australian pilot training program in last year's first quarter as well as other mission system program transitions and COVID-related timing impacts. And Missiles and Fire Control was lower due to supply chain delays in integrated air and missile defense, reduced sustainment revenue for special ops following the troop withdrawal from Afghanistan, and program transitions in the tactical and strike missile business. Aeronautics was flat this quarter as expected, with increased F-16 production offsetting lower volume on F-35. Moving to segment operating profit on chart 6. Operating margins were higher at space and MFC with the increase in space driven by additional ULA equity earnings, and MFC expansion from solid program performance and successful contract negotiations on an international program. Both aero and RMS margins contracted, primarily due to lower net profit adjustment, but they met or exceeded our expectations for the quarter. Overall, solid performance across the operations. Turning to earnings per share on chart 7. Our first quarter EPS of $6.44 declined by 2% and reflected the impact of decreased sales volume, mark-to-market adjustments and lower FAS/CAS income, partially offset by benefits from the increased segment operating margin, reduced share count and a lower tax rate. Shifting to first quarter cash generation and deployment on chart 8. Free cash flow of $1.1 billion was ahead of our expectations, following the very strong $3.7 billion of free cash flow generated during the fourth quarter of 2021. Cash deployment continued to drive value for our stockholders as we returned $2 billion through share repurchases, leaving approximately $2 billion on our existing authorization and outlook for 2022. Combined with nearly $800 million in dividends paid, we returned over 240% of free cash flow to shareholders this quarter. Operational cash remains solid as the business looks to grow quarter-over-quarter through the rest of 2022. Okay. Moving over to our 2022 outlook on chart 9. We remain confident in our full year outlook as we have seen improvements since the Omicron variant spike. Our first quarter sales were approximately $250 million below our expectations, which equates to less than a single day of volume, and we expect this to be fully recouped throughout 2022. For the balance of the year, we project sales of slightly below $16 billion in the second quarter, around $17 billion in the third quarter and $18 billion in the fourth quarter. As our release stated, our outlook does not include any impacts from potential debt refinance or pension liability transfer actions that are currently under evaluation. On chart 10, and we break out our segment sales and operating profit outlook. Our segment estimates for 2022 remain consistent with the guidance we provided in January, and we continue to anticipate long-term growth for all four of our business areas. It's important to note that our consolidated and aero outlooks are dependent upon reaching agreement on F-35 lots 15 through 17 here in the second quarter, as funding constraints would likely cause a timing impact to our financial results beginning this quarter. Our teams are diligently working with their Joint Program Office counterparts to achieve closure on this critical milestone and both parties are striving to finish negotiations in the near term. So, we remain confident in our full year projections. Okay. To bring it all together on chart 11. The first quarter delivered solid operational performance that was largely in line with our expectations in spite of the effects of the recent COVID spikes. Our cash generation and deployment also got off to a good start with a focus on strategic investment for growth and fulfilling our capital allocation outlook for the year. Our solid performance and our four-pillar growth strategy have us well positioned to deliver long-term shareholder value. So with that, John, let's open up the call for Q&A. Thank you, Rob. It's great to have you covering the Company and the industry again. Welcome back. Jim, let me just add on a little bit. As far as the negotiation, Sheila, we're encouraged by the progress being made. There has been progress, and we're encouraged by that. As far as an acute impact, it could be $500 million plus in the quarter, which we'd expect to be timing that we would recover in the balance of the year, assuming a successful negotiation. There does remain a gap, and Jim alluded to that. The team has been working with a sense of urgency to really complete this negotiation. And again, as Jim mentioned, it's important to keep in mind that we need to reach the right agreement for our stakeholders, even if that means we have to endure some impacts in the short term. As far as the production question. I mean, we're pretty confident in the 156 three-year plan that we had laid out before from a delivery profile. As you mentioned, the international customers and these customers that Jim just mentioned in his prepared remarks, provide some level of flexibility to really shore up that production schedule. You may have seen in the unfunded priority list for the Air Force, the Navy and the Marines, there was about 19 aircraft added to that. So, when you mix that in with the international demand, we feel very comfortable in our ability to maintain a 156 production cycle over that three-year period. No, I think that was well said. I think that's it. Let me take that question first. The budget was beneficial. I think as Jim mentioned, the trends are favorable, directionally, it's moving in the right way. And again, you would expect it to be incremental from the low single-digit baseline that we had previously provided. And maybe a little bit of color you've seen in a lot of reference to integrated deterrents emphasis on all domain and interoperability. And there's quite a few things from a programmatic standpoint to be excited about things like nuclear command control and communications reentry -- future reentry vehicle systems, our TACAMO recapitalizations, Next-Gen Interceptor, Next-Gen OPIR and others. And so, directionally, as I mentioned, it feels pretty good. As Jim had mentioned, we're still compiling this, and we're going through the analysis. It's going to take us some time to work through exactly what that means from an impact. I think it's fair to say that it's beneficial. It's biased to the upside, the extent to which they'll really have to work through and at the appropriate time, we'll let you know what that is. Yes. I'll just add, Kristine, that there are conversations ongoing with our government customer, to Jim's point, and sensitivity analysis, scenario planning and things like that. And as those firm up, we'll provide clearer information to you. Kai, so at this point, we would not expect any type of profit hit based on our negotiation as it currently stands. And again, it's a dynamic discussion, but we wouldn't expect any type of charge there. Going forward, as I mentioned here, the impact would be up $500 million plus in the second quarter. To further extent, obviously, that will go up. I think that we'll probably have to revisit later in the quarter to see how things are progressing. And I think we can update accordingly then. I think let's just kind of get through the quarter. We're encouraged and really pleased with the progress we're making to date. I know it's been a long road, but there's been some significant progress that's been made. And so, we're encouraged that we can be able to close this in a relatively short period of time. If not, then we'll update you accordingly at that point in time. Let me just add -- let me just clarify, Seth, in terms of the debt. We don't plan on delevering. It would be just refinancing what we have. And so, the existing capacity we have really doesn't change at all. The use of the cash wouldn't change either. It's just taking multi -- potentially multiple years and refinancing that in various tranches here and doing it efficiently. As far as the prioritization of our capital, I agree wholeheartedly with what Jim just laid out. And so, we're going to go through that evaluation process. Keep in mind, I've been with the Company about 2.5 months now. And so, I would just ask for a little bit of time for us to just go through this process deliberately and analytically so that we can make the best decisions. If you look at the industry, we've seen an uptick in valuations in the industry as a whole. But I would say, our stock still remains undervalued on a relative basis. And from an intrinsic value, we're just -- we're going through that whole analysis right now. Based on some of the questions you asked, really taking another look at our growth outlook in determining what that comes up from a value for the company. So, we're going to go through that. We're going to be deliberate about it and then make the best decisions from a capital deployment. The key here is that we've got plenty of flexibility and plenty of opportunity, and we won't be afraid to use it. Ultimately, what we want to do is get to sustainable growth in free cash flow per share, and that's what our objective is. Thanks for the question, David. Let me just maybe put it in a little bit of context, and remind you, in Jim's comments, we are a long-cycle business. So, benefits that you may see in a particular budget year manifest themselves and get delivered from a revenue standpoint over multiple years. And the best example I can give you is the -- 2022 plus-ups. If you look at the plus-ups and the impacts to us, that was about a little bit over 2 points of growth in any given year. But the reality is the profile -- delivery profile of that revenue stream is going to be over 3 to 4 years. And so, it's going be spread over. And so, as we just had an opportunity to have this presidential budget dropped, we're in the first inning here. We need to see -- let the process play out and get a better understanding in terms of what these program increments mean to us and in what periods. And so, we're just going to need some time to really go through that. And as I mentioned before, we'll obviously keep you updated at the appropriate time, but it's just a little early to really make those calls right now. Peter, I'll just add -- I mean, F-35 Lot 15 to 16, orders we expect, those are -- actually, they will have some international volumes associated with those big numbers this year, and those will really move the dial. We've got Black Hawk Multi-Year X, which is a multibillion-dollar award as well. And we didn't really talk about it here in the first quarter results, but we had about a $4 billion award in our classified. And if you recall, it's one of our pillars of growth here in the first quarter. So, very excited about that program as well. And so, we're positioned pretty well for award growth for the balance of the year and heading into next year. I'd say, it's a combination of both, Myles. You're pretty close to that underlying recurring margin percentage. If you think about it, last year was a pretty good size year as far as net profit positive adjustments. And as you would expect, those carry forward into higher run rate margins moving forward as you recognize revenue. And so, part of it is also mixes plays in the game as well. But I would expect what you saw in the first quarter to generally be what we'll see for the balance of the year. And so, we expect our profit adjustments to be lower year-over-year. Last year, we did about 28% of our profit. This year, in the first quarter, we did about 24%. For the full year, we're expecting that to be closer to 25%. And so -- but again, it's -- we're very comfortable with our margin outlook. We're very comfortable with our EPS outlook, and we're just seeing a little bit of a transition here with recurring versus margins versus the profit adjustments. That's a good question, George. Look, the second quarter would have us down around 7% year-over-year, and so we'd be down around that ballpark for the first half of the year. We're still -- while it's still a dynamic environment, I guess, is the best way to describe it. And we're still dealing -- even though we've seen significant improvement since the beginning of the year is still we're not out of the woods. And so, we're holding it there. We would still expect to have some level of impact that will clear itself up in the back half of the year. And that's really the placeholder for that second quarter number. We still are dealing with through the first half of the year, the impact of the Atomic Weapons Establishment program from the UK. And so, it's just -- year-over-year compares are tough. It is sequentially a pretty big step-up. You're talking $1 billion nearly, around that ballpark. And we think that's the right place to be for the moment. And of course, if anything changes, we'll update you accordingly. Yes. I'll just add, Doug, we are planning on a multiyear up cycle on PAC-3, where this year we'll deliver around 450 units, and that's spiking up to 550. And so, it's well positioned and contemplates some of the things that you've talked about already."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. In 2023, the 122,000 men and women of Lockheed Martin, working closely with our customers, made excellent progress advancing our 21st Century security strategy and delivered strong financial results for our shareholders. Turning to Chart 3. Robust demand for our broad portfolio of aircraft, helicopters, satellites, radar systems and other products, services and advanced digital technologies boosted backlog to a record $161 billion. Full-year sales of $67.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year and came in stronger than anticipated, as did earnings per share of $27.55. To position the company to take full advantage of these future growth opportunities, we invested more than $3 billion across research and development and capital in 2023. We generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow, as expected, which resulted in year-over-year free cash flow per share percentage growth in the mid-single digits. We returned approximately 145% of free cash flow to shareholders over $9 billion through dividends and share repurchases combined. Our expectation for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook, include low single-digit growth in sales off of the higher 2023 base and a range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion of free cash flow. Our ongoing dividend and expectation for $4 billion of share repurchases will sustain our focus on returns to shareholders in 2024. We also plan to further advance our vision for 21st Century security in the year as we believe that it is our responsibility at Lockheed Martin to bring the best of U.S. and allied technology and industrial capability to help maintain an effective deterrent to arm conflict and to provide our armed forces with the capabilities to win should we need to. First, we work closely with our supply chain to apply anti-fragility measures and increased resilience. Through teaming arrangements to expand sources of supply and by making strategic investments in start-ups with cutting-edge technologies. For example, we are collaborating with a supplier in which we have a minority investment, to accelerate our additive manufacturing progress, reducing material and process dependencies and complex thermal management applications such as heat exchangers. We also stood up a wholly owned subsidiary called ForwardEdge ASIC to work with major semiconductor fabs to design and manufacture the cutting-edge microprocessors that we need. Second, we led the industry to broaden and strengthen the defense industrial base by making significant progress with our commercial technology collaborators to bring their innovations into the service and national defense. For example, in the fourth quarter, Lockheed Martin worked together with a team, including Intel, Verizon, Microsoft, Juniper Networks, Keysight and Radisys to successfully demonstrate a secure, resilient, hybrid 5G and military datalink network in a live field demonstration in Colorado. Our 5G.MIL unified network solutions performed as a tactical and commercial multi-node hybrid network for integrating land, air and space operations. Together, we demonstrated absolutely cutting-edge system capabilities, performance and operation for customers in a field setting by combining the best of our technology with those of our commercial teammates. Third, we deepened relationships internationally with partners and allies to ensure that the U.S. can drive maximum interoperability in both industry and in military operations. We are making progress towards a mission-centric approach that uses the latest digital technologies to network aircraft, satellites, command centers and other key elements together to vastly improve their effectiveness and deterrent value across our U.S. and allied customers. One example from 2023 is work with Australia to develop Phase 1 of AIR6500, that's a joint battle management system and the first of its kind in terms of situational awareness and interoperability. This increases collaboration with trusted allies and partners can also help reduce the fragility and increase the capacity of the defense production system. Last week, Lockheed Martin was awarded the guided weapons production capability Risk Reduction Activity contract, which will provide a mechanism for swift knowledge and technology transfer and serve as a path finder to manufacturing our suite of guided munitions in Australia with their workforce and with contributions from their society and their economy. Turning briefly now to the status of the U.S. defense budget. The current proposed agreement being discussed with the administration in Congress would support an $886 billion top line budget, 3% higher than 2023. We will continue to monitor the status of the U.S. budget process and strongly believe that Lockheed Martin programs will continue to be well supported as the process unfolds. I'll now review a few notable highlights from our operations. Starting with Aeronautics and the F-35. We delivered 18 F-35 aircraft in the Technology Refresh 2 or TR-2 configuration in the fourth quarter, bringing the 2023 total to 98 [Indiscernible]. We are making continued progress towards delivering the first TR-3 configured aircraft. Today, over 90% of the TR-3 functionality is currently in flight test, and we are further advancing the software integration to include additional aircraft and mission subsystems. While this system maturation process continues to advance, it is taking somewhat more time than we originally anticipated. A second quarter customer acceptance of delivery software remains our target. However, we now believe that the third quarter may be more likely scenario for a TR-3 software acceptance. We are taking the time and attention to get this technology insertion right the first time because it will be absolutely worth it. The step function technological advances of TR-3 will provide our customers with the onboard digital infrastructure of data storage, data processing and pilot user interface to provide unmatched capabilities for many years to come. These include increased types of capability for air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, advanced sensing, jamming and cybersecurity capabilities and more accurate target recognition. To achieve this level of reliable capability for the long run, the resulting aircraft delivery range for 2024 is between 75 and 110 and requires the TR-3 hardware suppliers to keep pace with production demands both this year and in the future. Given the increasing operational capability and digital connectivity of the aircraft is a cornerstone of all domain operations, international demand for the F-35 remains very strong. In December, the Republic of Korea made a decision to procure 20 additional F-35 aircraft. Also in December, we presented the first F-35A to the Belgian government, which will be one of more than 600 F-35 that will be stationed in Europe across NATO member bases by the 2030s. Aero also continued to advance the F-16 as the first European F-16 training center in Romania was inaugurated in November and a partnership with Romania and the Netherlands. This center will provide world-class training to enhance mission readiness and ensure safety of flying and operating F-16 fighter jets. In addition, we delivered the first two Slovakian F-16 Block 70 jets in the fourth quarter. Deliveries for Slovakia totaling 14 aircraft will continue through 2025. Aero Skunk Works continues to pioneer groundbreaking innovation as well. And for a change, I can actually tell you about one. The X59 experimental supersonic aircraft built by Skunk Works and NASA Aeronautics was selected as one of Time Magazine's best inventions of 2023. The X59 is expected to transform the future of commercial supersonic flight over land by quieting the sonic boom, one of aviation's most persistent challenges. The X59 was unveiled at a rollout ceremony earlier this month and is expected to take first flight later this year. Our MFC business continued to push technological advancements forward as well through modernization of air and missile defense and precision strike capabilities. In the fourth quarter, we delivered the first Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, to the U.S. Army and conducted system qualification test for an extended range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System or GMLRS, which will extend the range of the HIMARS system that many of you are familiar with. MFC also delivered the 800th THAAD, that's a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense interceptor to the U.S. government in October. And also, we successfully integrated the PAC-3 Patriot Missile with the U.S. Army's new air and missile defense radar system to defend against cruise missiles, tactical ballistic missiles as well as hypersonics. International demand for the PAC-3 remains strong too. This year, Switzerland and Romania each signed Letters of Offer and Acceptance for PAC-3 MFCs, marking 15 partner nations for this program. RMS also saw strong international interest in the fourth quarter. The U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Martin contract to produce eight MH-60 Romeo SEAHAWK helicopters for the Spanish Navy and six of them for the Norwegian government as well. To date, Sikorsky has delivered 330 MH-60 Romeo aircraft to five countries, including the United States, 67 more are on order or in production for India, Greece, South Korea, Australia and now Spain and Norway. Also in the quarter, Sikorsky installed the U.S. Army's improved turbine engine on our RAIDER X, designed for the Army's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft or FARA program. This final phase of the RAIDER X build brings us one step closer to completing the system that will support the Army's high-tech future missions requirements, and we anticipate the first flight of RAIDER X in late 2024. Finally, turning to space. United Launch Alliance successfully launched The Vulcan Centaur Rocket earlier in January. This launch was the first of two flights required to complete National Security Space Certification and the second planned mission could happen as soon as April. The U.S. Air Force awarded space a nearly $1 billion contract to develop a new reentry vehicle for the Sentinel Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. The reentry vehicle or Mk21A will be mounted on top to Sentinel. The award follows a technology maturation and risk reduction contract and the ICBM recapitalization contributes to modernizing strategic deterrents and reinforcing Lockheed Martin's critical technological contributions to the nuclear triad. And last week, the Space Development Agency announced Lockheed Martin was awarded an almost $900 million contract for Tranche 2 Tracking Layer to provide 18 small sats, 16 of those space vehicles are for missile warning and tracking and two space vehicles are for missile defense infrared sensors to be on board. The first group of nine satellites is expected to launch in April of 2027. A lot going on at Lockheed Martin, all of our operations. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions.\nJay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will recap our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial results and provide our initial guidance for 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. On Chart 4, we'll start with the fourth quarter results for consolidated sales and segment operating profit. We had a better-than-expected close to the year, nearly matching last year's record fourth quarter. Sales exceeded internal expectations by close to $1 billion, with the improvement largely due to material throughput, leading to a less than 1% year-over-year decline in the quarter and a sign of improving synchronization between Lockheed Martin's demand signals and supply chain fulfillment. The strong finish led to about 2.5% sales growth for the year, which was about $2 billion stronger on an absolute basis than originally expected last January. Overall segment operating profit in the quarter was also better than expected on the higher sales volume and was down 1% year-over-year due to lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings. Book-to-bill was 1.15 for the year with strength across all four segments. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS grew 2% year-over-year, with lower segment profit and higher interest expense more than offset by benefits from the lower share count and fewer mark-to-market losses. Excluding mark-to-market activity and other nonrecurring charges, adjusted EPS was up $0.11 year-over-year or 1%. For the year, adjusted EPS was $27.82, up 2% year-over-year and consistent with the sales growth. The steady improvement this year resulted in higher adjusted EPS by about $1 per share from our original expectations last January. Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $6.2 billion for the full-year, helped by approximately $625 million in working capital reductions in the fourth quarter from strong and timely conversion of operational milestone achievement to billings and collections. We maintained our commitment to shareholders by returning $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases this quarter and over $9 billion for the year or 145% of our free cash flow. Before getting into the segments, let me pause here to put the numbers in perspective. The key takeaway is that industry growth is crystallizing based on three converging demand cycles. First, to meet support requirements of the near and midterm security environment; second, to strengthen the effectiveness of existing security platforms and systems with improved sensing, connectivity, interoperability and embedded intelligence. And lastly, to recapitalize platforms and systems that maintain technological superiority in deterrence over a longer time frame. We expect these demand trends to endure and drive requirements to closely match with Lockheed Martin's advanced technology and systems integration capabilities. The long-cycle nature of Lockheed Martin Systems has in part, led to slower growth, but the 2023 results show that it is materializing as evidenced by our 7% increase in ending backlog to a record $161 billion as well as our return to top line growth a year earlier than originally expected. And we demonstrated our confidence in the company's positioning amongst these demand cycles and multiyear outlook by again delivering strong shareholder returns. Over the past two years, we have repurchased about 12% of the current market capitalization. Okay, back to the segment details and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Fourth quarter sales at Aero were comparable year-over-year with higher volume at Skunk Works and the F-16 production ramp offset by lower volume on F-35 primarily production cost timing. As expected, operating profit decreased 7% from the prior year due to lower net profit adjustments. For the year, sales were up 2% as growth in Skunk Works and F-16 more than offset a low single-digit decline on F-35. Profit declined by 1%, primarily due to lower profit adjustments. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.14, leading to 6% growth in the backlog to $60 billion, with nearly 600 aircraft across all production platforms in the backlog. Shifting to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales in the quarter decreased 4% year-over-year, driven by lower volume on PAC-3 due to supplier cost timing, partially offset by production ramps on JASSM and LRASM. Segment operating profit decreased 12% year-over-year as expected due to the lower volume and loss recognition related to a classified program. For the year, sales decreased 1% year-over-year as growth in tactical and strike missiles were offset by program transitions at Sensors and Global Sustainment and integrated air and missile defense supplier cost timing. Operating profit was down 6% due to lower profit adjustments and the classified program loss. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.3, leading to 12% growth in backlog to $32 billion, driven by strong demand for tactical and strike missiles. Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9. Sales declined 2% in the quarter, driven by lower volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors and training and logistics systems lines of business, partially offset by higher sales at Sikorsky from deliveries of International Blackhawks. Operating profit increased 2% mainly due to favorable contract mix within our IWSS portfolio. For the year, sales were up 1% as growth in IWSS from Radar and battle management system ramps, more than offset declines in the other lines of business. Operating profit declined 2%, primarily due to lower profit adjustments. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 with backlog growing 8% to $38 billion based on strong order intake on Sikorsky platforms as well as radar and battle management systems. On Chart 10, as expected, space growth moderated in the quarter with sales increasing 3% year-over-year, driven by higher volume in strategic and missile defense, primarily from Next Gen Interceptor as that program advances from its successful completion of preliminary design review towards the critical design review milestone. Operating profit increased 31% compared to 2022 driven by higher net profit adjustments across the portfolio. For the year, sales increased 9% with growth across all lines of businesses. And profit grew by 10% as benefits from higher profit adjustments and volume more than offset lower ULA equity income. Space backlog grew again in fourth quarter and remains at a solid $30 billion or almost 2.5x sales. Now shifting to the outlook for 2024 on Page 11. Before discussing our expectations, I'd like to highlight a few key assumptions embedded within our guidance for the year. First, based on recent progress made in budget negotiations, we assume the U.S. government passes appropriations bills by March, consistent with the funding levels within the President's FY '24 budget request, equating to approximately 3% top line growth for the DoD. On F-35, as Jim stated, we're targeting between 75 to 110 deliveries commencing in the third quarter. In addition, we anticipate sufficient progress being made on the MFC classified program to result in the recognition of losses from two production lots, amounting to approximately 50 basis points of margin headwind against our consolidated results. With that framework in mind, we anticipate sales between $68.5 billion and $70 billion, with the midpoint that represents approximately 2.5% growth. At the midpoint, we expect growth in three of the four segments with MFC leading the way at 7% growth from a strong munitions backlog. At the high end, all four segments would grow. Segment operating profit is expected to be between $7.175 billion and $7.375 billion down at the midpoint as lower expected profit adjustments and the MFC classified losses more than offset volume benefits. Excluding the MFC classified program, 50 basis points impact, underlying margins in the balance of the portfolio are expected to be approximately 11%. Our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment declines around $400 million from last year to a little less than $1.7 billion for 2024 due primarily to lower FAS pension income. The pension headwind, along with lower segment profit and higher interest expense lead to lower expected EPS year-over-year to be between $25.65 and $26.35. For purposes of clarity, on Page 12, we've included an EPS walk at the midpoint of the range. Benefits from volume mix provide about $0.55, with the impact of the MFC classified program losses, netting down segment operating profit to a $0.35 decline. Total FAS/CAS pension is about $1.40 headwind with higher taxes and interest more than offset by the lower share count. Our free cash flow estimate for 2024 has ranged between $6 billion and $6.3 billion. So bringing it all together, we expect continued sales growth in 2024 off the higher 2023 base, some profit and EPS pressure based on loss recognition timing, but with continued solid cash generation and capping it off with another year of capital deployment. So in summary, on Page 13. We closed out 2023 with record backlog and positive momentum that will carry us into 2024 with a line of sight to sustained out-year growth in sales, profit and free cash flow. Of course, we will continue to invest in 1LMX as part of our strategy to ensure our people, processes and systems remain the most advanced in the industry, and we remain committed to disciplined and dynamic capital returns to shareholders. With that, Luis, let's open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to lead off with Aero and F-35 in particular, in the margins, number one, that you're looking for in '24 are down about 40 basis points. Is that primarily on lower incentives as a result of the delays in delivery. And then more broadly, for the supply chain on the F-35, given the absence of deliveries, can you continue to simply build inventory, or is there a point at which you'd actually have to slow down the supply chain? Thanks.\nJay Malave: Okay. Thanks, Myles. On the margins for F-35, what we're seeing in 2024 are lower favorable profit adjustments, and so it's really twofold. One of it is the F-35, where as we make progress on the TR-3 program as well as getting ourselves into production, it's difficult to take risk and rely on risk retirements as we're still facing this program and the progress we're making there. And so we assume that the profit adjustments slowdown in 2024 on the F-35 program. There's also some headwinds on C-130 program, where we're seeing the effects of inflation and also some disruption related to supply chain, some pressures that we've had there. And so when you look at that decline year-over-year, you're talking about 30 basis points, say, half and half between C-130 and F-35. On the production cadence for F-35, yes, we feel pretty confident in where we are through the third quarter. To the extent that there were any delays beyond that, we would have to revisit our production cadence at that point in time. But right now, all signs are pointing to our production and delivery restart here in the third quarter.\nMyles Walton: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nJay Malave: Good morning, Scott.\nScott Deuschle: Jay, here to ask on 2025, but at a high level, is the 10.5% total company margin guide for '24, is that the right jumping off point for thinking about 25%, or is it the 11% underlying margin, or is it the 10.8% margin you did in '23, just in terms of identifying jumping off point for thinking about '25? Thank you.\nJay Malave: Yes, I think you do have to start at the 10.5% to jump off. And we do have a line of sight and a path to get overall back to 11%, including the absorption of these losses on the MFC classified program, but it's going to be a gradual march back up. And so I wouldn't expect it to snap back in 2025. I would expect there to be in the range of, say, 10 to 20 basis points of improvement starting in '25, and that to continue to grow at that rate until we get back up to 11.\nOperator: Thank you. And your next question is from Gavin Parsons from UBS Equity Research. Please go ahead.\nGavin Parsons: Hey, good morning.\nJay Malave: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Jay, what does the pension contribution schedule look like beyond 2024? And do you have any opportunity to pull that forward or use the balance sheet to offset that?\nJay Malave: Yes, a good question. That's something that we've contemplated. Just where we are from a baseline perspective, zero contributions required in 2024. 2025, we're looking at in the range of about $1 billion of required contributions there. And so we're always looking at whether or not there's an opportunity to pull forward. As you mentioned, the utilization of our strong balance sheet to potentially do that. We haven't made any firm decisions on that, but that's definitely an opportunity that's under consideration for us.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Please go ahead.\nPete Skibitski: Hey, good morning guys.\nJay Malave: Good morning.\nPete Skibitski: Jim or Jay, can you give us a sense for how much the '24 guide is impacted by what looks like on the order of a six-month delay here to the government's budget and still a little bit of lack of clarity in the supplementals?\nJay Malave: Yes, for the most part, Pete, it's not really impacted significantly. In our case, we're able to build up inventories. And then as we get the funding, we're able to take that to sales. And so for the most part, we've kept all of our processes intact up. That becomes more difficult if the process extends beyond March. And that's why I was very clear in my comments that we\u2019re dependent on this happening that the budget getting clarity and finalization in March. Because going beyond that makes it very -- just makes it difficult for things to get on contract and you run out of runway in the year to convert those into sales.\nPete Skibitski: Okay. Appreciate it. And then anything on big awards you're expecting in '24 and maybe the timing of NGAD?\nJay Malave: Well, just some key things that we're talking about from sales perspective. Lot '18, '19 is a big one for the F-35 program. We also have some long lead F-35 awards that we would be expecting as well. We've got things -- there are some classified contracts across the portfolio. I can't really get into any beyond that. But you're talking multi-billions of dollars there that we have in our order plan for this year. There are things like PAC-3 orders, which is multiple billions of dollars there for FY '24 requirements. And also, I would say hypersonics space, particularly on CPS is another one that can approach $2 billion. So there are a number there. As those get clicked off in the year, we'll certainly report on those and keep you appraised on the progress.\nPeter Skibitski: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi Research. Please go ahead.\nJason Gursky: Yes, hey, Jay, just a quick clarification then one for Jim and sorry if I missed this, but the deliveries that you're expecting for the F-35 this year with the acceptance on T-3 happening potentially in the third quarter. Can you discuss a little bit about the cadence throughout the year? Do you expect to deliver some F-35s throughout the year and maybe the older version of it in the first half of the year? I'm just trying to get a sense of whether you're truly doing 75 to 100 aircraft in the second half of the year? And what does that tell us about the potential for deliveries in 2025. Can you get to 200 in that year as a bit of a catch-up? And then, Jim, for you, just overall expectations on bookings, book-to-bill for this next year based on the pipeline that you're seeing and maybe just kind of update us on your current thoughts on the competitive environments and fixed price versus cost plus, and how you -- how the industry and you all specifically are kind of reacting to the contracting environment and what's being asked of you and whether you're toggling back more towards less risky programs? Thanks.\nJay Malave: So let me get into the deliveries. Jason, we do have a handful of deliveries we expect in the first half. But for the most part, you're talking 90% of the anticipated deliveries actually will happen in the back half of the year. And so I think that's just the way to think about just a handful, really in the first half. Maybe I'll kind of give a little bit of color and then hand it over to Jim. For the year, we still expect there to be strong demand, and we have a pretty solid line of sight to a book-to-bill that would be above one yet again in 2024. And so obviously, these things have to materialize. The budget has to be approved and all these things have to happen. But the line of sight is there for continued growth in orders as well as in our backlog. A couple of things, too, and you've just done the question about cost plus. The interesting thing is that part of the margin pressure that we saw in 2023 was due to mix. Our percent of sales of cost type contracts went from 38% in 2022 to 41% in 2023. That in itself caused some margin pressure of about 20 basis points relative to what we were anticipating in the year. And so we're actually seeing an uptick in cost plus contracts, which we think kind of bodes well from terms of risk tolerance in the way some of these stronger technological types of programs will be contracted for. And so I think that is, generally speaking, a favorable trend. Well, the other thing that we're -- just to talk about what we're thinking about contractually, and Jim has really led the way here is that we just are employing a lot more pricing discipline than we have more recently. And we're looking at things and ensuring that there's just a more analytical support for the way we approach pricing. Do we capture any types of technological advantages that we may have also that as we make an assessment of risk, a, the contracting vehicle is appropriate to that risk, but that our pricing accounts for that risk as well. And so that's the way we've been approaching things for really this year going into 2024. And I'll hand it over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. Sure, Jay. So look, there's a near-term and a long-term approach that we're taking to government contracting with industry. And the near-term piece of it is a lot of what Jay just described, really matching the pricing and the risk profile within our company, I'll say. Now I don't know what other companies doing and how they're making their decisions. But what we've recognized and I've said to our senior customer base, look, we're in a monopsony environment here, meaning there's a single buyer for the most part, for almost everything that we make or Boeing Defense makes or Gel Dynamics makes. And so I guess, the government's credit in a way, they've been taking advantage of that monopsony power, if you will, over the industry. And what's happened as a result of that over the last number of years or even decades is you have lots of programs which are over cost, cost overruns, right, whether fixed price or cost plus and you have scheduled delays because what that monopsony environment can do is give so much power to the buyer that some of the competitors feel that there are must-win programs for them that they will take tremendous risk on cost and pricing and tremendous cost on the ability to technically deliver these capabilities. So when you multiply those two risks together, you get a lot of cost overruns, a lot of schedule delays, programs reviewed by Congress, et cetera. So I've been advocating in the near term and certainly implementing with our company, we don't have any must-win programs at Lockheed Martin anymore. If we have a good business opportunity with a balanced price risk profile, we will bid. If not, we will not bid. If we hit our limit parameters, we won't go beyond those, a competitor may win, so be it. And so that's our near-term approach to this. The longer-term approach is in addition to delivering products that we and our cohorts in the traditional defense industry do so well, we need to start migrating towards delivering capabilities, right? So capability would include either products that are already fielded and/or new products, but especially digital technologies, which is why we are collaborating with so much effort with commercial tech companies large and small, because we can value price capabilities, right? If we sell products, and that's all we do as an industry, we are kind of locked into the far, the federal acquisition regulation as it is written today, which means even a fixed price contract, you've got to provide all your cost information, right? And you have to do it often every year even with a multi-year fixed price, and there can be adjustments. So we want to move as briskly as we can as an industry with our commercial partners to their kind of pricing, which is value-based subscription. That's going to take time. It's going to take changes in government. It's going to probably take literally act of Congress to do it. But that will be the thing that will make our industry healthier on one hand, the traditional defense and aerospace industry, but it will also invite in the commercial tech companies who are basically, if you look at the broad scope investing 10x what we are in R&D. And we want to bring a lot of that 10x R&D and all that talent over into the defense department as part of their supply chain, but it's really tough under the bar for those companies to put time and attention and effort into DoD. So that's the long-term -- a long-term solution, but the near-term solution will also continue.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nDouglas Harned: As you look at Tech Refresh 3, this delay and then going longer, as you really want to build out the full kind of Block 4 capabilities, which continue to seem to expand. First, as Tech Refresh 3 takes longer. And then as you look toward the kind of multi-year trajectory on Block 4 implementation, how do you see delays here affecting your production rate, knowing that you've been trying to produce sort of at the full 156 type rate. But can that continue as you look at these challenges if they get more difficult?\nJim Taiclet: Look Doug, it's Jim. I think we can continue at this rate. Demand from the U.S. services and our international customers, Air Forces, Navy's, et cetera, around the world is they need the aircraft, right? They've got to recapitalize the planes that they're still flying that I was trying to get when I went to pilot training in 1983, right? So this is essential that this production line keep up, it's the -- basically, it's the recapitalization of the Allied fighter aircraft for us is the F-35. And so I think the key to that is full transparency and realizing the reality of the situation. When you're trying to drive this much technology into an air vehicle, you've got to be honest about the schedule. What can industry do, what can the test and evaluation community handle in the various military to accept that technology and what's the supply chain capacity. And we're being brutally honest with our services and our joint program offices to what we think industry can do with us and our airplane. And industry is who makes the radar. Industry is who makes the EOT, the electrical optical system. The industry is who makes the electronic warfare suite. It's not us. So we have to be brutally honest as an industry and with our suppliers' inputs to that with the government and say what is feasible to keep the production rate up. I think that's starting to get traction. I hope it gets more traction, because we cannot afford to be overoptimistic in the ability to deliver these technologies as rapidly as one might like. There are real technical and physical challenges to doing this. And well our commitment to the government, meeting the service chiefs and our allies is I will tell you honestly, what we think industry can do with the jet. And if you want to push it beyond that, I'll tell you what the risks are and what the cost might be to do it. But let's agree on a feasible executable plan for exactly Doug, what you talked about.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Jim, I don't want to talk about what happened in 1983, but in terms of the puts and takes for MSC, if you could just talk about the 7% top line growth you guys have what are the biggest program drivers there between missile defense and tactical, and just on the margins, you've already highlighted the 50 bps from the classified programs. Are there any offsets? And I really appreciate your commentary about the government and how you plan to sell to them. So I was just thinking, where do you think that will manifest itself in its portfolio in your portfolio, the fact is, is it MFC? And specifically, can you give any specifics?\nJay Malave: Yes. Sure. I'll start with the growth drivers. And for MFC, you would expect, tactical and strike missiles. So the guided weapons, the HIMARS, JASSM, LRASM, all those will continue towards their march through these ramps by 2025 and in certain cases, 2026 and 2027. So that is the largest driver of the growth. And that's followed by Integrated Air and Missile Defense really on the back of PAC-3. So we'll start seeing a more significant spike in PAC-3 activity and deliveries over the next few years here as we get to 550 by 2025, and then ultimately 650 by 2027. So those are the two -- really the two businesses, the lines of business within MFC that are going to be driving it, which is really should be no surprise.\nJim Taiclet: And then when it gets to moving towards a value pricing model, Sheila. The first place that's already starting to happen is in command and control, command situational awareness, information advantages our customers would call it. So those are largely digital services, right? You've got sensors on satellites, aircraft, ships, radars out scanning the sky, infrared sensors in space looking for looms of heat when a missile is launched, things like that. That's data, right? So how do we gathered all the data from our sensors, whatever domain they happen to be in land airspace, et cetera. How do we make intelligent data fusion, and then present commanders and decision makers with options using AI and other digital services. So this will be probably the first place where we can value price because my goal is to bring in commercial technology to do that digital, digital data fusion, evaluation, AI application, et cetera. As I said a minute ago, commercial industry is investing 10x what our aerospace and defense industry could invest in these areas, and we need to take advantage of that. The only way they're going to participate in a material fashion in that industry is value pricing. They're not going to provide cost information. It's just not how their industry works. They're not delivering an airplane that you can add up all the costs that it took to make that airplane and give it to the government, so they can give you the margin on top. So these command and control systems, and they're real programs, by the way, defensive Blohm is a program like this, AIR6500 is one dimension. And also something called Joint Fires Network, which will be deployed in the Indo Paycom Command of the U.S. So this is where I think it will start. And then as we look at mission road maps that we've established and drawn out inside of Lockheed Martin, and we're now sharing and have been sharing with the U.S. services and VOD. We're looking for capability gaps where digital technology can really make a difference, right? So I'll give you one really quick one. So if we could get a direct feed from an orbiting satellite scanning a wide swath of the Pacific to find ships and actually directly provide that data link and that information to aircraft flying in the area, then those aircraft can vector towards those targets and turn on their radars and get a much more precise location and maybe even a tracking solution to sync the ship if that's what's needed. And so that's a mission gap, a capability gap that we would have in an antiship mission. And so how do we value price that because that's basically a data management exercise, which requires what we call 5G.MIL. It requires an artificial intelligence solution within it, and it requires the management of that data at various classifications, which is something not many companies can do besides those in our industry. So we can value price something like that. And I think it'd be a capability gap that would be interesting to the Department of Defense, and they might accept value pricing, but not to take too much time on this topic. But one of the things that we're really advocating for at Lockheed Martin, and we've got some friends of the court trying to work with us on this is, how do we set up an adjacent acquisition process in the Department of Defense to its traditional acquisition process, designed and reconstituted and originated to purchase digital services versus platforms and products, which is what the traditional acquisition system is built to do. That is a heavy lift. It is very complicated. It's what I've kind of referenced earlier, where you're literally going to need to act the contrast to do this. But if we want to value price as an industry, bringing commercial partners at scale, I think the government needs to consider and actually go do this with us.\nJay Malave: Let me just circle back, Sheila, on the margins in your question. I'll use MFC as an example in 2024. When you look at their headwind, the headwind is about 200 basis points of margin compression in the year 2024. The MSC classified program is actually accounted for 230. And so the rest of their business is actually expanding by 30 basis points. And so they're doing everything we would expect them to do in their core business. In general, across all of Lockheed Martin, the way we're approaching these headwinds is really threefold. First, we're just keeping a tight lid on overhead and indirect costs and streamlining that cost structure where the opportunities exist. The second is we're driving cost reduction in our direct cost base through supply chain optimization, factory productivity and also on 1LMX driven efficiencies. And then lastly, we talked about a little bit earlier in the call, is just making sure that we're employing pricing discipline across our bid and proposals. And so those three together will help us drive to a better result in the future and give us confidence that we'll be able to expand margins even with these headwinds.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Okay. Thanks very much. And good morning, everyone. Maybe one clarification and one question. Jay, on F-35, at the end of '24, should we think about there being maybe 120 undelivered aircraft in inventory based on the production rate of 150 plus and the deliveries you've told us, that's the clarification, and that inventory will have to be worked out over the subsequent year or two. And then as far as the question goes, I think you talked about 10 to 20 basis points of segment margin expansion in '25. If we thought about only one lot exercised on classified missile, that's probably 25 basis points. The margin in aeronautics seems pretty depressed in '24. So you think there may be some potential for expansion there. And you just talked about the efforts that you're making across the company to support margins. Are there other discrete headwinds that we're not aware of that wouldn't allow -- that would prevent more than that kind of 10 to 20 basis points that you outlined?\nJay Malave: Yes. Let me start with that question first, and I'll come back to the F-35. Just on the 2025 margins going forward, yes, it would be essentially one lot versus two. However, you got to take into account the volumes that are in that lot versus the volumes that we're in these first two lots. And so you really -- you think about it from a gross headwind, it doesn't necessarily change all that much, because you're -- there's more in there. And so that's what's keeping the pressure. There's not just an automatic lift, because we're going from two lots to one lot in a subsequent year. On the F-35, I mean, I think the way you've talked about it Seth is right, anywhere between 100 to 120 aircraft is in terms of undelivered -- against the 156 type of expected delivery rate is the right way to think about it, yes.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRonald Epstein: [indiscernible] question.\nJim Taiclet: Hey, Ron.\nRonald Epstein: I'll do the question first. What are you thinking about the opportunity for the Black Hawk going forward, meaning I don't know, we've kind of heard there's some challenges on future vertical lift. And what opportunities does that open to you for the Black Hawk?\nJim Taiclet: Ron, it's Jim. Look, the Black Hawk, and I've gotten a flight autonomously and by hand actually. I think has a lot of potential. There's interesting Congress for modernization of the Black Hawk. There's a huge fleet out there. And by adding some of these digital capabilities like autonomy and AI to the Black Hawk, which is a really reliable platform that's offline in units today in great numbers and across our allies. That's a real, I think, value opportunity for the Army's in ring cores and others that use the helicopter. So I do think there's a lot of upside there. I don't want to comment on anybody else's programs or how well or not they may be doing, but this is a proven scaled vehicle with digital technology upgrade and insertion can be very, very versatile. And that can be done much more rapidly than new production of new aircraft. So I do think that there is upside there. Now the services and Congress have to agree. And to that and fund those modernizations and keep those units flying. And that will be up to them. But we are trying to provide them every opportunity to make that decision by inserting digital and other technologies like autonomy that will really make the aircraft much more capable in doing missions like air evacuation, resupply of the hot landing zone, things like that, that when you put it into the entire equation, of completing a mission, it will be a good value to consider it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hey, Jay, Jim, I mean, there's been discussion in the public markets about the depletion of U.S. missiles ammunitions and a potential shortage mean that side from your commentary today, it sounds like supply chain issues continue to linger, weighing on the company's ability to convert the demand into revenue. So can you talk more about the additional actions you're taking to improve the supply chain's ability to get products through the system? And what metrics are you monitoring? And how much upside could you see in 2024 if things improve?\nJim Taiclet: I'll make a couple of comments and ask Jay to follow. The steps that we're taking to take the fragility out of the missile production system are varied. One of them is -- and it's very specific, we are endeavoring to stand up a third solid rocket motor supplier in the United States that can be additive to the industry supply chain we have today, which hasn't been performing well, right? That's one piece. More broadly, we're using additive manufacturing, and we're bringing in more varied suppliers into the supply chain, so that we can get the materials we need from a more diverse set of group of suppliers outside of solid rocket motors. And also, we're looking at international opportunities to build this equipment including in Australia and in Poland, U.K. and others are kind of on tap for coproduction or joint ventures with us to do these things, in Germany, I should mention as well. So these are some of the approaches we're taking. And it really comes down to these three areas, which is how can we on one hand take basic steps in anti-fragility to more suppliers, more diversity on the supply chain, different labor pools, better training, those kinds of things where it's just basic. Secondly, how can we insert technology to make this more reliable production system, which we just mentioned. And then thirdly is how do we get international countries and take advantage of their labor forces, their supply to sub-supply chains, et cetera, and get them into the production system. So we look at this in all three areas of our core company strategy and apply it to missile production. Jay, anything you want to add?\nJay Malave: Yes. I'll just say over the last year, Kristine, we've deployed resources. So we haven't just sat back and waiting for improvement. Depending on the supplier, depending on the issues, we have deployed manufacturing engineering resources. We've deployed quality engineering resources and program management resources as well as, in certain cases, we've actually deployed hourly workers to support suppliers in certain cases. And so we've taken an all-hands on deck approach, where we've seen the issues become more significant. And we've done everything we can to support these suppliers and help them get through. I would expect that to continue where we see these bottlenecks. But as I mentioned earlier, we did see some general improvement. We are expecting that improvement to continue. And in terms of potential upside, what I would point you to is that if we're able to unlock and see a little bit better performance and that what drives to the high end of our sales profit and EPS range.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Akers: Hey, good morning. Thanks guys. Could you touch on F-16 real quick, just latest thoughts on the ramp rate here and also just margins on that program that compares to the segment now? And then sort of do they get better over time as you kind of come back down learning curve?\nJay Malave: Yes. So we delivered five aircrafts in 2023. We would expect that to triple potentially quadruple here in 2024. And so we're -- the ramp is certainly in full force. We've got over 30 aircraft there in WIP as we ended the year. And so that is, I think, from a delivery standpoint, increasing the production cadence is all trending well. From a profitability standpoint, you may recall, we've had some pressure because it's taken us longer to get to this point. And so that puts some pressure on our initial contracts. Here, as we fully deliver those out and deliver on the subsequent contracts, we will see profitability improve on the F-16 over the next few years.\nOperator: Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes, hello.\nJim Taiclet: Hey, George.\nGeorge Shapiro: I'm talking at a longer-term perspective here. If I look at the margins like from 10 years ago, MFC made 18%, aeronautics made 11%, space made 13%. And so we're obviously down in all of those categories overall, maybe 200 basis points in 10 years ago. So my question is, was this due to a lot of the fixed price development, more aggressive bidding. And now you're trying to change that. So when we look towards 2025, we actually could see margins go up from where they'd be in 2024 for kind of -- are they just lower margins overall that we expect to see from what we used to see?\nJim Taiclet: George, hey, it's Jim here. I think the story, I told a little bit earlier today is what caused that. There was margin compression in the whole industry here, driven by the [indiscernible] [1:00:20] customer, if you will. So they got pretty good at figuring out how to use their position in the quarter analysis of how they should negotiate contracts. And what I think you're seeing is boards and management of companies in our traditional space, I'll call it, are understanding this now, the management tends to not necessarily -- senior management tends not to necessarily be historically wedded to this business model and looking at other ways to run these companies. And so we are taking the shareholders' interest into account and all the things we talked about, which should help improve our margins, even though it may result in some difficult discussions with some of the customer base. We're prepared to do that. But I think over the last 10 years, as you said, there's been a decline and it needs to reverse to have a healthy industry.\nMaria Ricciardone: Okay. Luis, I think we're at the top of the hour. So I'm just going to turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\nJim Taiclet: Okay. Thanks, Maria. So over the past 12 months, again, I mentioned the people of Lockheed Martin have worked relentlessly to advance this vision we have for 21st Century security and transform our company internally, and they created produced and delivered cutting-edge capabilities that are focused on what the defense department says as its own strategy that they call integrated deterrence. And we're trying to maintain our company values along the way, and that's to do what's right, respect others and perform with excellence. And all this yields positive results for our employees at work here, our customers and our suppliers and especially our shareholders. So thanks again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. Luis, that concludes the call. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 earnings call. In 2023, the 122,000 men and women of Lockheed Martin, working closely with our customers, made excellent progress advancing our 21st Century security strategy and delivered strong financial results for our shareholders. Turning to Chart 3. Robust demand for our broad portfolio of aircraft, helicopters, satellites, radar systems and other products, services and advanced digital technologies boosted backlog to a record $161 billion. Full-year sales of $67.6 billion increased 2% year-over-year and came in stronger than anticipated, as did earnings per share of $27.55. To position the company to take full advantage of these future growth opportunities, we invested more than $3 billion across research and development and capital in 2023. We generated $6.2 billion of free cash flow, as expected, which resulted in year-over-year free cash flow per share percentage growth in the mid-single digits. We returned approximately 145% of free cash flow to shareholders over $9 billion through dividends and share repurchases combined. Our expectation for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook, include low single-digit growth in sales off of the higher 2023 base and a range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion of free cash flow. Our ongoing dividend and expectation for $4 billion of share repurchases will sustain our focus on returns to shareholders in 2024. We also plan to further advance our vision for 21st Century security in the year as we believe that it is our responsibility at Lockheed Martin to bring the best of U.S. and allied technology and industrial capability to help maintain an effective deterrent to arm conflict and to provide our armed forces with the capabilities to win should we need to. First, we work closely with our supply chain to apply anti-fragility measures and increased resilience. Through teaming arrangements to expand sources of supply and by making strategic investments in start-ups with cutting-edge technologies. For example, we are collaborating with a supplier in which we have a minority investment, to accelerate our additive manufacturing progress, reducing material and process dependencies and complex thermal management applications such as heat exchangers. We also stood up a wholly owned subsidiary called ForwardEdge ASIC to work with major semiconductor fabs to design and manufacture the cutting-edge microprocessors that we need. Second, we led the industry to broaden and strengthen the defense industrial base by making significant progress with our commercial technology collaborators to bring their innovations into the service and national defense. For example, in the fourth quarter, Lockheed Martin worked together with a team, including Intel, Verizon, Microsoft, Juniper Networks, Keysight and Radisys to successfully demonstrate a secure, resilient, hybrid 5G and military datalink network in a live field demonstration in Colorado. Our 5G.MIL unified network solutions performed as a tactical and commercial multi-node hybrid network for integrating land, air and space operations. Together, we demonstrated absolutely cutting-edge system capabilities, performance and operation for customers in a field setting by combining the best of our technology with those of our commercial teammates. Third, we deepened relationships internationally with partners and allies to ensure that the U.S. can drive maximum interoperability in both industry and in military operations. We are making progress towards a mission-centric approach that uses the latest digital technologies to network aircraft, satellites, command centers and other key elements together to vastly improve their effectiveness and deterrent value across our U.S. and allied customers. One example from 2023 is work with Australia to develop Phase 1 of AIR6500, that's a joint battle management system and the first of its kind in terms of situational awareness and interoperability. This increases collaboration with trusted allies and partners can also help reduce the fragility and increase the capacity of the defense production system. Last week, Lockheed Martin was awarded the guided weapons production capability Risk Reduction Activity contract, which will provide a mechanism for swift knowledge and technology transfer and serve as a path finder to manufacturing our suite of guided munitions in Australia with their workforce and with contributions from their society and their economy. Turning briefly now to the status of the U.S. defense budget. The current proposed agreement being discussed with the administration in Congress would support an $886 billion top line budget, 3% higher than 2023. We will continue to monitor the status of the U.S. budget process and strongly believe that Lockheed Martin programs will continue to be well supported as the process unfolds. I'll now review a few notable highlights from our operations. Starting with Aeronautics and the F-35. We delivered 18 F-35 aircraft in the Technology Refresh 2 or TR-2 configuration in the fourth quarter, bringing the 2023 total to 98 [Indiscernible]. We are making continued progress towards delivering the first TR-3 configured aircraft. Today, over 90% of the TR-3 functionality is currently in flight test, and we are further advancing the software integration to include additional aircraft and mission subsystems. While this system maturation process continues to advance, it is taking somewhat more time than we originally anticipated. A second quarter customer acceptance of delivery software remains our target. However, we now believe that the third quarter may be more likely scenario for a TR-3 software acceptance. We are taking the time and attention to get this technology insertion right the first time because it will be absolutely worth it. The step function technological advances of TR-3 will provide our customers with the onboard digital infrastructure of data storage, data processing and pilot user interface to provide unmatched capabilities for many years to come. These include increased types of capability for air-to-air and air-to-ground munitions, advanced sensing, jamming and cybersecurity capabilities and more accurate target recognition. To achieve this level of reliable capability for the long run, the resulting aircraft delivery range for 2024 is between 75 and 110 and requires the TR-3 hardware suppliers to keep pace with production demands both this year and in the future. Given the increasing operational capability and digital connectivity of the aircraft is a cornerstone of all domain operations, international demand for the F-35 remains very strong. In December, the Republic of Korea made a decision to procure 20 additional F-35 aircraft. Also in December, we presented the first F-35A to the Belgian government, which will be one of more than 600 F-35 that will be stationed in Europe across NATO member bases by the 2030s. Aero also continued to advance the F-16 as the first European F-16 training center in Romania was inaugurated in November and a partnership with Romania and the Netherlands. This center will provide world-class training to enhance mission readiness and ensure safety of flying and operating F-16 fighter jets. In addition, we delivered the first two Slovakian F-16 Block 70 jets in the fourth quarter. Deliveries for Slovakia totaling 14 aircraft will continue through 2025. Aero Skunk Works continues to pioneer groundbreaking innovation as well. And for a change, I can actually tell you about one. The X59 experimental supersonic aircraft built by Skunk Works and NASA Aeronautics was selected as one of Time Magazine's best inventions of 2023. The X59 is expected to transform the future of commercial supersonic flight over land by quieting the sonic boom, one of aviation's most persistent challenges. The X59 was unveiled at a rollout ceremony earlier this month and is expected to take first flight later this year. Our MFC business continued to push technological advancements forward as well through modernization of air and missile defense and precision strike capabilities. In the fourth quarter, we delivered the first Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, to the U.S. Army and conducted system qualification test for an extended range Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System or GMLRS, which will extend the range of the HIMARS system that many of you are familiar with. MFC also delivered the 800th THAAD, that's a Terminal High Altitude Area Defense interceptor to the U.S. government in October. And also, we successfully integrated the PAC-3 Patriot Missile with the U.S. Army's new air and missile defense radar system to defend against cruise missiles, tactical ballistic missiles as well as hypersonics. International demand for the PAC-3 remains strong too. This year, Switzerland and Romania each signed Letters of Offer and Acceptance for PAC-3 MFCs, marking 15 partner nations for this program. RMS also saw strong international interest in the fourth quarter. The U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Martin contract to produce eight MH-60 Romeo SEAHAWK helicopters for the Spanish Navy and six of them for the Norwegian government as well. To date, Sikorsky has delivered 330 MH-60 Romeo aircraft to five countries, including the United States, 67 more are on order or in production for India, Greece, South Korea, Australia and now Spain and Norway. Also in the quarter, Sikorsky installed the U.S. Army's improved turbine engine on our RAIDER X, designed for the Army's Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft or FARA program. This final phase of the RAIDER X build brings us one step closer to completing the system that will support the Army's high-tech future missions requirements, and we anticipate the first flight of RAIDER X in late 2024. Finally, turning to space. United Launch Alliance successfully launched The Vulcan Centaur Rocket earlier in January. This launch was the first of two flights required to complete National Security Space Certification and the second planned mission could happen as soon as April. The U.S. Air Force awarded space a nearly $1 billion contract to develop a new reentry vehicle for the Sentinel Intercontinental Ballistic Missile. The reentry vehicle or Mk21A will be mounted on top to Sentinel. The award follows a technology maturation and risk reduction contract and the ICBM recapitalization contributes to modernizing strategic deterrents and reinforcing Lockheed Martin's critical technological contributions to the nuclear triad. And last week, the Space Development Agency announced Lockheed Martin was awarded an almost $900 million contract for Tranche 2 Tracking Layer to provide 18 small sats, 16 of those space vehicles are for missile warning and tracking and two space vehicles are for missile defense infrared sensors to be on board. The first group of nine satellites is expected to launch in April of 2027. A lot going on at Lockheed Martin, all of our operations. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions. Good morning. Yes. Sure, Jay. So look, there's a near-term and a long-term approach that we're taking to government contracting with industry. And the near-term piece of it is a lot of what Jay just described, really matching the pricing and the risk profile within our company, I'll say. Now I don't know what other companies doing and how they're making their decisions. But what we've recognized and I've said to our senior customer base, look, we're in a monopsony environment here, meaning there's a single buyer for the most part, for almost everything that we make or Boeing Defense makes or Gel Dynamics makes. And so I guess, the government's credit in a way, they've been taking advantage of that monopsony power, if you will, over the industry. And what's happened as a result of that over the last number of years or even decades is you have lots of programs which are over cost, cost overruns, right, whether fixed price or cost plus and you have scheduled delays because what that monopsony environment can do is give so much power to the buyer that some of the competitors feel that there are must-win programs for them that they will take tremendous risk on cost and pricing and tremendous cost on the ability to technically deliver these capabilities. So when you multiply those two risks together, you get a lot of cost overruns, a lot of schedule delays, programs reviewed by Congress, et cetera. So I've been advocating in the near term and certainly implementing with our company, we don't have any must-win programs at Lockheed Martin anymore. If we have a good business opportunity with a balanced price risk profile, we will bid. If not, we will not bid. If we hit our limit parameters, we won't go beyond those, a competitor may win, so be it. And so that's our near-term approach to this. The longer-term approach is in addition to delivering products that we and our cohorts in the traditional defense industry do so well, we need to start migrating towards delivering capabilities, right? So capability would include either products that are already fielded and/or new products, but especially digital technologies, which is why we are collaborating with so much effort with commercial tech companies large and small, because we can value price capabilities, right? If we sell products, and that's all we do as an industry, we are kind of locked into the far, the federal acquisition regulation as it is written today, which means even a fixed price contract, you've got to provide all your cost information, right? And you have to do it often every year even with a multi-year fixed price, and there can be adjustments. So we want to move as briskly as we can as an industry with our commercial partners to their kind of pricing, which is value-based subscription. That's going to take time. It's going to take changes in government. It's going to probably take literally act of Congress to do it. But that will be the thing that will make our industry healthier on one hand, the traditional defense and aerospace industry, but it will also invite in the commercial tech companies who are basically, if you look at the broad scope investing 10x what we are in R&D. And we want to bring a lot of that 10x R&D and all that talent over into the defense department as part of their supply chain, but it's really tough under the bar for those companies to put time and attention and effort into DoD. So that's the long-term -- a long-term solution, but the near-term solution will also continue. Good morning. Look Doug, it's Jim. I think we can continue at this rate. Demand from the U.S. services and our international customers, Air Forces, Navy's, et cetera, around the world is they need the aircraft, right? They've got to recapitalize the planes that they're still flying that I was trying to get when I went to pilot training in 1983, right? So this is essential that this production line keep up, it's the -- basically, it's the recapitalization of the Allied fighter aircraft for us is the F-35. And so I think the key to that is full transparency and realizing the reality of the situation. When you're trying to drive this much technology into an air vehicle, you've got to be honest about the schedule. What can industry do, what can the test and evaluation community handle in the various military to accept that technology and what's the supply chain capacity. And we're being brutally honest with our services and our joint program offices to what we think industry can do with us and our airplane. And industry is who makes the radar. Industry is who makes the EOT, the electrical optical system. The industry is who makes the electronic warfare suite. It's not us. So we have to be brutally honest as an industry and with our suppliers' inputs to that with the government and say what is feasible to keep the production rate up. I think that's starting to get traction. I hope it gets more traction, because we cannot afford to be overoptimistic in the ability to deliver these technologies as rapidly as one might like. There are real technical and physical challenges to doing this. And well our commitment to the government, meeting the service chiefs and our allies is I will tell you honestly, what we think industry can do with the jet. And if you want to push it beyond that, I'll tell you what the risks are and what the cost might be to do it. But let's agree on a feasible executable plan for exactly Doug, what you talked about. Good morning. And then when it gets to moving towards a value pricing model, Sheila. The first place that's already starting to happen is in command and control, command situational awareness, information advantages our customers would call it. So those are largely digital services, right? You've got sensors on satellites, aircraft, ships, radars out scanning the sky, infrared sensors in space looking for looms of heat when a missile is launched, things like that. That's data, right? So how do we gathered all the data from our sensors, whatever domain they happen to be in land airspace, et cetera. How do we make intelligent data fusion, and then present commanders and decision makers with options using AI and other digital services. So this will be probably the first place where we can value price because my goal is to bring in commercial technology to do that digital, digital data fusion, evaluation, AI application, et cetera. As I said a minute ago, commercial industry is investing 10x what our aerospace and defense industry could invest in these areas, and we need to take advantage of that. The only way they're going to participate in a material fashion in that industry is value pricing. They're not going to provide cost information. It's just not how their industry works. They're not delivering an airplane that you can add up all the costs that it took to make that airplane and give it to the government, so they can give you the margin on top. So these command and control systems, and they're real programs, by the way, defensive Blohm is a program like this, AIR6500 is one dimension. And also something called Joint Fires Network, which will be deployed in the Indo Paycom Command of the U.S. So this is where I think it will start. And then as we look at mission road maps that we've established and drawn out inside of Lockheed Martin, and we're now sharing and have been sharing with the U.S. services and VOD. We're looking for capability gaps where digital technology can really make a difference, right? So I'll give you one really quick one. So if we could get a direct feed from an orbiting satellite scanning a wide swath of the Pacific to find ships and actually directly provide that data link and that information to aircraft flying in the area, then those aircraft can vector towards those targets and turn on their radars and get a much more precise location and maybe even a tracking solution to sync the ship if that's what's needed. And so that's a mission gap, a capability gap that we would have in an antiship mission. And so how do we value price that because that's basically a data management exercise, which requires what we call 5G.MIL. It requires an artificial intelligence solution within it, and it requires the management of that data at various classifications, which is something not many companies can do besides those in our industry. So we can value price something like that. And I think it'd be a capability gap that would be interesting to the Department of Defense, and they might accept value pricing, but not to take too much time on this topic. But one of the things that we're really advocating for at Lockheed Martin, and we've got some friends of the court trying to work with us on this is, how do we set up an adjacent acquisition process in the Department of Defense to its traditional acquisition process, designed and reconstituted and originated to purchase digital services versus platforms and products, which is what the traditional acquisition system is built to do. That is a heavy lift. It is very complicated. It's what I've kind of referenced earlier, where you're literally going to need to act the contrast to do this. But if we want to value price as an industry, bringing commercial partners at scale, I think the government needs to consider and actually go do this with us. Hey, Ron. Ron, it's Jim. Look, the Black Hawk, and I've gotten a flight autonomously and by hand actually. I think has a lot of potential. There's interesting Congress for modernization of the Black Hawk. There's a huge fleet out there. And by adding some of these digital capabilities like autonomy and AI to the Black Hawk, which is a really reliable platform that's offline in units today in great numbers and across our allies. That's a real, I think, value opportunity for the Army's in ring cores and others that use the helicopter. So I do think there's a lot of upside there. I don't want to comment on anybody else's programs or how well or not they may be doing, but this is a proven scaled vehicle with digital technology upgrade and insertion can be very, very versatile. And that can be done much more rapidly than new production of new aircraft. So I do think that there is upside there. Now the services and Congress have to agree. And to that and fund those modernizations and keep those units flying. And that will be up to them. But we are trying to provide them every opportunity to make that decision by inserting digital and other technologies like autonomy that will really make the aircraft much more capable in doing missions like air evacuation, resupply of the hot landing zone, things like that, that when you put it into the entire equation, of completing a mission, it will be a good value to consider it. I'll make a couple of comments and ask Jay to follow. The steps that we're taking to take the fragility out of the missile production system are varied. One of them is -- and it's very specific, we are endeavoring to stand up a third solid rocket motor supplier in the United States that can be additive to the industry supply chain we have today, which hasn't been performing well, right? That's one piece. More broadly, we're using additive manufacturing, and we're bringing in more varied suppliers into the supply chain, so that we can get the materials we need from a more diverse set of group of suppliers outside of solid rocket motors. And also, we're looking at international opportunities to build this equipment including in Australia and in Poland, U.K. and others are kind of on tap for coproduction or joint ventures with us to do these things, in Germany, I should mention as well. So these are some of the approaches we're taking. And it really comes down to these three areas, which is how can we on one hand take basic steps in anti-fragility to more suppliers, more diversity on the supply chain, different labor pools, better training, those kinds of things where it's just basic. Secondly, how can we insert technology to make this more reliable production system, which we just mentioned. And then thirdly is how do we get international countries and take advantage of their labor forces, their supply to sub-supply chains, et cetera, and get them into the production system. So we look at this in all three areas of our core company strategy and apply it to missile production. Jay, anything you want to add? Hey, George. George, hey, it's Jim here. I think the story, I told a little bit earlier today is what caused that. There was margin compression in the whole industry here, driven by the [indiscernible] [1:00:20] customer, if you will. So they got pretty good at figuring out how to use their position in the quarter analysis of how they should negotiate contracts. And what I think you're seeing is boards and management of companies in our traditional space, I'll call it, are understanding this now, the management tends to not necessarily -- senior management tends not to necessarily be historically wedded to this business model and looking at other ways to run these companies. And so we are taking the shareholders' interest into account and all the things we talked about, which should help improve our margins, even though it may result in some difficult discussions with some of the customer base. We're prepared to do that. But I think over the last 10 years, as you said, there's been a decline and it needs to reverse to have a healthy industry. Okay. Thanks, Maria. So over the past 12 months, again, I mentioned the people of Lockheed Martin have worked relentlessly to advance this vision we have for 21st Century security and transform our company internally, and they created produced and delivered cutting-edge capabilities that are focused on what the defense department says as its own strategy that they call integrated deterrence. And we're trying to maintain our company values along the way, and that's to do what's right, respect others and perform with excellence. And all this yields positive results for our employees at work here, our customers and our suppliers and especially our shareholders. So thanks again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in April. Luis, that concludes the call. Thank you."

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will recap our fourth quarter and full-year 2023 financial results and provide our initial guidance for 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. On Chart 4, we'll start with the fourth quarter results for consolidated sales and segment operating profit. We had a better-than-expected close to the year, nearly matching last year's record fourth quarter. Sales exceeded internal expectations by close to $1 billion, with the improvement largely due to material throughput, leading to a less than 1% year-over-year decline in the quarter and a sign of improving synchronization between Lockheed Martin's demand signals and supply chain fulfillment. The strong finish led to about 2.5% sales growth for the year, which was about $2 billion stronger on an absolute basis than originally expected last January. Overall segment operating profit in the quarter was also better than expected on the higher sales volume and was down 1% year-over-year due to lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings. Book-to-bill was 1.15 for the year with strength across all four segments. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS grew 2% year-over-year, with lower segment profit and higher interest expense more than offset by benefits from the lower share count and fewer mark-to-market losses. Excluding mark-to-market activity and other nonrecurring charges, adjusted EPS was up $0.11 year-over-year or 1%. For the year, adjusted EPS was $27.82, up 2% year-over-year and consistent with the sales growth. The steady improvement this year resulted in higher adjusted EPS by about $1 per share from our original expectations last January. Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. We generated $1.7 billion of free cash flow in the quarter and $6.2 billion for the full-year, helped by approximately $625 million in working capital reductions in the fourth quarter from strong and timely conversion of operational milestone achievement to billings and collections. We maintained our commitment to shareholders by returning $3.8 billion through dividends and share repurchases this quarter and over $9 billion for the year or 145% of our free cash flow. Before getting into the segments, let me pause here to put the numbers in perspective. The key takeaway is that industry growth is crystallizing based on three converging demand cycles. First, to meet support requirements of the near and midterm security environment; second, to strengthen the effectiveness of existing security platforms and systems with improved sensing, connectivity, interoperability and embedded intelligence. And lastly, to recapitalize platforms and systems that maintain technological superiority in deterrence over a longer time frame. We expect these demand trends to endure and drive requirements to closely match with Lockheed Martin's advanced technology and systems integration capabilities. The long-cycle nature of Lockheed Martin Systems has in part, led to slower growth, but the 2023 results show that it is materializing as evidenced by our 7% increase in ending backlog to a record $161 billion as well as our return to top line growth a year earlier than originally expected. And we demonstrated our confidence in the company's positioning amongst these demand cycles and multiyear outlook by again delivering strong shareholder returns. Over the past two years, we have repurchased about 12% of the current market capitalization. Okay, back to the segment details and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Fourth quarter sales at Aero were comparable year-over-year with higher volume at Skunk Works and the F-16 production ramp offset by lower volume on F-35 primarily production cost timing. As expected, operating profit decreased 7% from the prior year due to lower net profit adjustments. For the year, sales were up 2% as growth in Skunk Works and F-16 more than offset a low single-digit decline on F-35. Profit declined by 1%, primarily due to lower profit adjustments. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.14, leading to 6% growth in the backlog to $60 billion, with nearly 600 aircraft across all production platforms in the backlog. Shifting to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales in the quarter decreased 4% year-over-year, driven by lower volume on PAC-3 due to supplier cost timing, partially offset by production ramps on JASSM and LRASM. Segment operating profit decreased 12% year-over-year as expected due to the lower volume and loss recognition related to a classified program. For the year, sales decreased 1% year-over-year as growth in tactical and strike missiles were offset by program transitions at Sensors and Global Sustainment and integrated air and missile defense supplier cost timing. Operating profit was down 6% due to lower profit adjustments and the classified program loss. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.3, leading to 12% growth in backlog to $32 billion, driven by strong demand for tactical and strike missiles. Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9. Sales declined 2% in the quarter, driven by lower volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors and training and logistics systems lines of business, partially offset by higher sales at Sikorsky from deliveries of International Blackhawks. Operating profit increased 2% mainly due to favorable contract mix within our IWSS portfolio. For the year, sales were up 1% as growth in IWSS from Radar and battle management system ramps, more than offset declines in the other lines of business. Operating profit declined 2%, primarily due to lower profit adjustments. Book-to-bill for the year was 1.14 with backlog growing 8% to $38 billion based on strong order intake on Sikorsky platforms as well as radar and battle management systems. On Chart 10, as expected, space growth moderated in the quarter with sales increasing 3% year-over-year, driven by higher volume in strategic and missile defense, primarily from Next Gen Interceptor as that program advances from its successful completion of preliminary design review towards the critical design review milestone. Operating profit increased 31% compared to 2022 driven by higher net profit adjustments across the portfolio. For the year, sales increased 9% with growth across all lines of businesses. And profit grew by 10% as benefits from higher profit adjustments and volume more than offset lower ULA equity income. Space backlog grew again in fourth quarter and remains at a solid $30 billion or almost 2.5x sales. Now shifting to the outlook for 2024 on Page 11. Before discussing our expectations, I'd like to highlight a few key assumptions embedded within our guidance for the year. First, based on recent progress made in budget negotiations, we assume the U.S. government passes appropriations bills by March, consistent with the funding levels within the President's FY '24 budget request, equating to approximately 3% top line growth for the DoD. On F-35, as Jim stated, we're targeting between 75 to 110 deliveries commencing in the third quarter. In addition, we anticipate sufficient progress being made on the MFC classified program to result in the recognition of losses from two production lots, amounting to approximately 50 basis points of margin headwind against our consolidated results. With that framework in mind, we anticipate sales between $68.5 billion and $70 billion, with the midpoint that represents approximately 2.5% growth. At the midpoint, we expect growth in three of the four segments with MFC leading the way at 7% growth from a strong munitions backlog. At the high end, all four segments would grow. Segment operating profit is expected to be between $7.175 billion and $7.375 billion down at the midpoint as lower expected profit adjustments and the MFC classified losses more than offset volume benefits. Excluding the MFC classified program, 50 basis points impact, underlying margins in the balance of the portfolio are expected to be approximately 11%. Our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment declines around $400 million from last year to a little less than $1.7 billion for 2024 due primarily to lower FAS pension income. The pension headwind, along with lower segment profit and higher interest expense lead to lower expected EPS year-over-year to be between $25.65 and $26.35. For purposes of clarity, on Page 12, we've included an EPS walk at the midpoint of the range. Benefits from volume mix provide about $0.55, with the impact of the MFC classified program losses, netting down segment operating profit to a $0.35 decline. Total FAS/CAS pension is about $1.40 headwind with higher taxes and interest more than offset by the lower share count. Our free cash flow estimate for 2024 has ranged between $6 billion and $6.3 billion. So bringing it all together, we expect continued sales growth in 2024 off the higher 2023 base, some profit and EPS pressure based on loss recognition timing, but with continued solid cash generation and capping it off with another year of capital deployment. So in summary, on Page 13. We closed out 2023 with record backlog and positive momentum that will carry us into 2024 with a line of sight to sustained out-year growth in sales, profit and free cash flow. Of course, we will continue to invest in 1LMX as part of our strategy to ensure our people, processes and systems remain the most advanced in the industry, and we remain committed to disciplined and dynamic capital returns to shareholders. With that, Luis, let's open up the call for Q&A. Okay. Thanks, Myles. On the margins for F-35, what we're seeing in 2024 are lower favorable profit adjustments, and so it's really twofold. One of it is the F-35, where as we make progress on the TR-3 program as well as getting ourselves into production, it's difficult to take risk and rely on risk retirements as we're still facing this program and the progress we're making there. And so we assume that the profit adjustments slowdown in 2024 on the F-35 program. There's also some headwinds on C-130 program, where we're seeing the effects of inflation and also some disruption related to supply chain, some pressures that we've had there. And so when you look at that decline year-over-year, you're talking about 30 basis points, say, half and half between C-130 and F-35. On the production cadence for F-35, yes, we feel pretty confident in where we are through the third quarter. To the extent that there were any delays beyond that, we would have to revisit our production cadence at that point in time. But right now, all signs are pointing to our production and delivery restart here in the third quarter. Good morning, Scott. Yes, I think you do have to start at the 10.5% to jump off. And we do have a line of sight and a path to get overall back to 11%, including the absorption of these losses on the MFC classified program, but it's going to be a gradual march back up. And so I wouldn't expect it to snap back in 2025. I would expect there to be in the range of, say, 10 to 20 basis points of improvement starting in '25, and that to continue to grow at that rate until we get back up to 11. Good morning. Yes, a good question. That's something that we've contemplated. Just where we are from a baseline perspective, zero contributions required in 2024. 2025, we're looking at in the range of about $1 billion of required contributions there. And so we're always looking at whether or not there's an opportunity to pull forward. As you mentioned, the utilization of our strong balance sheet to potentially do that. We haven't made any firm decisions on that, but that's definitely an opportunity that's under consideration for us. Good morning. Yes, for the most part, Pete, it's not really impacted significantly. In our case, we're able to build up inventories. And then as we get the funding, we're able to take that to sales. And so for the most part, we've kept all of our processes intact up. That becomes more difficult if the process extends beyond March. And that's why I was very clear in my comments that we're dependent on this happening that the budget getting clarity and finalization in March. Because going beyond that makes it very -- just makes it difficult for things to get on contract and you run out of runway in the year to convert those into sales. Well, just some key things that we're talking about from sales perspective. Lot '18, '19 is a big one for the F-35 program. We also have some long lead F-35 awards that we would be expecting as well. We've got things -- there are some classified contracts across the portfolio. I can't really get into any beyond that. But you're talking multi-billions of dollars there that we have in our order plan for this year. There are things like PAC-3 orders, which is multiple billions of dollars there for FY '24 requirements. And also, I would say hypersonics space, particularly on CPS is another one that can approach $2 billion. So there are a number there. As those get clicked off in the year, we'll certainly report on those and keep you appraised on the progress. So let me get into the deliveries. Jason, we do have a handful of deliveries we expect in the first half. But for the most part, you're talking 90% of the anticipated deliveries actually will happen in the back half of the year. And so I think that's just the way to think about just a handful, really in the first half. Maybe I'll kind of give a little bit of color and then hand it over to Jim. For the year, we still expect there to be strong demand, and we have a pretty solid line of sight to a book-to-bill that would be above one yet again in 2024. And so obviously, these things have to materialize. The budget has to be approved and all these things have to happen. But the line of sight is there for continued growth in orders as well as in our backlog. A couple of things, too, and you've just done the question about cost plus. The interesting thing is that part of the margin pressure that we saw in 2023 was due to mix. Our percent of sales of cost type contracts went from 38% in 2022 to 41% in 2023. That in itself caused some margin pressure of about 20 basis points relative to what we were anticipating in the year. And so we're actually seeing an uptick in cost plus contracts, which we think kind of bodes well from terms of risk tolerance in the way some of these stronger technological types of programs will be contracted for. And so I think that is, generally speaking, a favorable trend. Well, the other thing that we're -- just to talk about what we're thinking about contractually, and Jim has really led the way here is that we just are employing a lot more pricing discipline than we have more recently. And we're looking at things and ensuring that there's just a more analytical support for the way we approach pricing. Do we capture any types of technological advantages that we may have also that as we make an assessment of risk, a, the contracting vehicle is appropriate to that risk, but that our pricing accounts for that risk as well. And so that's the way we've been approaching things for really this year going into 2024. And I'll hand it over to Jim. Yes. Sure. I'll start with the growth drivers. And for MFC, you would expect, tactical and strike missiles. So the guided weapons, the HIMARS, JASSM, LRASM, all those will continue towards their march through these ramps by 2025 and in certain cases, 2026 and 2027. So that is the largest driver of the growth. And that's followed by Integrated Air and Missile Defense really on the back of PAC-3. So we'll start seeing a more significant spike in PAC-3 activity and deliveries over the next few years here as we get to 550 by 2025, and then ultimately 650 by 2027. So those are the two -- really the two businesses, the lines of business within MFC that are going to be driving it, which is really should be no surprise. Let me just circle back, Sheila, on the margins in your question. I'll use MFC as an example in 2024. When you look at their headwind, the headwind is about 200 basis points of margin compression in the year 2024. The MSC classified program is actually accounted for 230. And so the rest of their business is actually expanding by 30 basis points. And so they're doing everything we would expect them to do in their core business. In general, across all of Lockheed Martin, the way we're approaching these headwinds is really threefold. First, we're just keeping a tight lid on overhead and indirect costs and streamlining that cost structure where the opportunities exist. The second is we're driving cost reduction in our direct cost base through supply chain optimization, factory productivity and also on 1LMX driven efficiencies. And then lastly, we talked about a little bit earlier in the call, is just making sure that we're employing pricing discipline across our bid and proposals. And so those three together will help us drive to a better result in the future and give us confidence that we'll be able to expand margins even with these headwinds. Yes. Let me start with that question first, and I'll come back to the F-35. Just on the 2025 margins going forward, yes, it would be essentially one lot versus two. However, you got to take into account the volumes that are in that lot versus the volumes that we're in these first two lots. And so you really -- you think about it from a gross headwind, it doesn't necessarily change all that much, because you're -- there's more in there. And so that's what's keeping the pressure. There's not just an automatic lift, because we're going from two lots to one lot in a subsequent year. On the F-35, I mean, I think the way you've talked about it Seth is right, anywhere between 100 to 120 aircraft is in terms of undelivered -- against the 156 type of expected delivery rate is the right way to think about it, yes. Yes. I'll just say over the last year, Kristine, we've deployed resources. So we haven't just sat back and waiting for improvement. Depending on the supplier, depending on the issues, we have deployed manufacturing engineering resources. We've deployed quality engineering resources and program management resources as well as, in certain cases, we've actually deployed hourly workers to support suppliers in certain cases. And so we've taken an all-hands on deck approach, where we've seen the issues become more significant. And we've done everything we can to support these suppliers and help them get through. I would expect that to continue where we see these bottlenecks. But as I mentioned earlier, we did see some general improvement. We are expecting that improvement to continue. And in terms of potential upside, what I would point you to is that if we're able to unlock and see a little bit better performance and that what drives to the high end of our sales profit and EPS range. Yes. So we delivered five aircrafts in 2023. We would expect that to triple potentially quadruple here in 2024. And so we're -- the ramp is certainly in full force. We've got over 30 aircraft there in WIP as we ended the year. And so that is, I think, from a delivery standpoint, increasing the production cadence is all trending well. From a profitability standpoint, you may recall, we've had some pressure because it's taken us longer to get to this point. And so that puts some pressure on our initial contracts. Here, as we fully deliver those out and deliver on the subsequent contracts, we will see profitability improve on the F-16 over the next few years."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us on our third quarter 2023 earnings call. All of us on the line today are well aware that since our last call, the world is now seeing yet another terrible conflict. Everyone in our company remains dedicated to fully supporting the United States government's policy and efforts to deter aggression, restore security and achieve peace. Today, I will first highlight our third quarter results as we pursue our vision of 21st Century Security, designed to support the U.S. Department of Defense Strategy of Integrated deterrents and then I'll turn it over to Jay to provide additional detail before taking your questions. Starting on Page 3 of the slides. Sales increased 2% year-over-year to $16.9 billion and backlog remains at historically high levels at $156 million. EPS of $6.73 exceeded prior year and free cash flow was a strong $2.5 billion. We returned approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Earlier in October, we announced a $0.15 increase in our dividend which reflects 5% growth and is the 21st consecutive year of dividend increases for Lockheed Martin. At the same time, our Board also approved a $6 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $13 billion, reconfirming our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We are also reaffirming our full year 2023 financial outlook for sales, profit, EPS and free cash flow. Given the current status of the 2024 U.S. defense budget, global geopolitical tensions and the macroeconomic environment, we will provide our expectations for our 2024 financial outlook during our full year 2023 earnings call in January. On the U.S. budget, though the specific trajectory of the future U.S. defense budget is still in process between the administration and Congress, the global threat landscape is increasingly elevated. Our robust backlog reflects the relevance and importance of the Lockheed Martin portfolio and elevating deterrence to great power conflict involving the United States and its allies and the solid positioning of our business to serve our domestic and international customers. From a process standpoint and government, the current continuing resolution or CR is in place through November 17. At that point, one of the following could occur. FY '24 appropriations bills will be enacted, Congress will enact another partial or whole CR or there could be a partial or full government shutdown. In any of these scenarios, there continues to be the option also for supplemental requests related to support Ukraine, Israel and potentially Taiwan. As Congress continues to work through the FY '24 appropriations bills, we are optimistic that there will be consistent support for the National Defense strategy and funding for its priorities. In the meantime, we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to minimize any potential disruptions due to the process. And we will press on with executing our 21st Century security strategy of building capacity, efficiency and resilience into our production operations, driving advanced digital technologies to enhance integrated deterrents and expanding our international business and operations. Turning to the F-35 program. We delivered 30 F-35 aircraft in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 80 jets. Consistent with our announcement in September, we continue to expect to deliver a total of 97 aircraft this year, all in the Technology Refresh 2 or TR2 configuration. We are producing F-35s at a rate of 156 per year, and expect to continue at that pace while simultaneously working to finalize TR3 software development testing. And we recently began flight test evaluations of the next software release that encompasses major systems upgrades such as improved RADAR, next-gen distributed aperture system and weapons capability. As previously announced, we continue to expect to deliver the first TR3 configured aircraft between April and June of 2024. The superior technological capabilities of the F-35 continue to generate strong interest both domestically and internationally. In September, Denmark's first four locally based F-35 aircraft arrived on their home soil. Denmark's program of record calls for 27 F-35A aircraft. Also in September, the Czech Republic chose to become part of the global F-35 Lightning II program, and the U.S. State Department approved a possible $5 billion foreign military sale to South Korea for up to 25 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Earlier in the quarter, Israel announced that we'll buy an additional 25 F-35, which will add a third squadron and increased its F-35 fleet to 75 aircraft. Additionally, in August, Lockheed Martin was selected by the Australian Department of Defense, as their strategic partner for their Air 6500 program Phase 1. This transformational Pathfinder program will deliver the broadest scope of Joint All Domain Operations, JADO in the free world, and will completely revolutionize the way the Australian defense force operates. By connecting Australian systems and platforms that operate across air, space, land, sea and cyber domains, we expect that Air 6500 will set the blueprint for future military operations worldwide. This proven technology will provide greater situational awareness and defense against increasingly advanced air and missile threats and enables significantly greater interoperability between Australia and allied nations. Lockheed Martin will lead this first phase which will provide the core architecture and multi-domain integration for the program. This is just one recent win that demonstrates the business success of our 21st Century security cornerstone, trusted and reliable battle management and command and control systems that integrate across multiple domains, military services and allied forces. Late last year, Lockheed Martin also won the $500 million Defense of Guam award. And in late September, we were also awarded a potential seven-year, over $1 billion contract for systems engineering and software integration to the integrated combat system across the surface force portfolio of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. This will link together systems and software across the services and a JADO construct and it not only enables faster decision-making and better capabilities but also serves as a much more effective global deterrent strategy. Beyond these awards, we continue to develop 21st Century security technologies to advance interoperability between Lockheed Martin product lines. The 5G.MIL hybrid base station that our engineers invented is the 1 LM initiative that includes teams at MFC and Aeronautics. We recently transferred data from a sniper targeting pod that was set up in Orlando, Florida to the Tactical Missile Simulation Lab in Grand Prairie, Texas to provide real-time updates to a simulated missile in-flight. This event significantly advanced efforts towards upcoming live fire demonstrations across the main platforms operating in a joint environment that will use data from multiple sources across an open architecture. Also, Skunk Works partnered with the University of Iowa's Operator Performance Laboratory to demonstrate an AI commanded jamming capability. In this, we successfully used artificial intelligence on two air systems to provide jamming support to a simulated strike against enemy air defenses. This demonstration showed how AI agents with high performance and reliable behavior can operate in close coordination with and be controlled by human crude aircraft. We also conducted a successful test of the prototype radio for the PAC-3 MSC missile that will enable communications with the SPY-1 radar, the key sensor in the Aegis Weapon System. This test performed by a 1 LM team across MFC and RMS paves the way for the design of a multifrequency radio data link for PAC-3 MSC. In turn, that will enable the U.S. Navy for the first time to have the ability to integrate the state-of-the-art PAC-3 missile onto its warships and open up another opportunity for Lockheed Martin in the future. International interest in PAC-3 also remains strong. As demonstrated by our deepening partnership with Poland, which signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 644 PAC-3 MSCs and related equipment in the quarter. In our RMS business, Sikorsky CH-53K helicopter is expected to grow meaningfully also over the coming years. In August, we won a $2.7 billion contract to build and deliver 35 additional CH-53K helicopters and it's the largest procurement to date for this multi-mission aircraft. Another longstanding major Lockheed Martin program, this one is space is also poised for significant growth ramp. In late September, the Fleet Ballistic Missile program won a $1.2 billion contract for the Navy's Trident II D5 life extension. For nearly seven decades, Lockheed Martin has supported the U.S. Navy as a critical partner for its mission to provide sea-based strategic deterrents. The TRIDENT II D5 LE missile will be in service through the 2040s, maintaining the proven performance of the D5 system for significantly less cost to the government than of designing a new missile. Also in our Space business, Lockheed Martin's Next Generation Interceptor or NGI program, executed its digital preliminary design review in partnership with the Missile Defense Agency customer. That happened on September 29. During this review, the MDA assessed the NGI program's readiness and maturity to continue into the detailed design phase, confirming that our solution continues to meet the requirements for this crucial and demanding mission. Finally, the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule touched down in the Utah Desert on September 24, returning NASA's first ever sample from an asteroid. After a seven-year mission traveling approximately, I believe is 4 billion miles in space. The capsule holds material from Bennu, a carbon-rich asteroid and scientists hope it will teach us more about the origins of organics that led to life on earth, plus the mechanics behind overall planet formation After release of the capsule, the spacecraft was set on a new course to investigate the asteroid Apophis under the mission name OSIRIS-REx. So with that interesting and exciting news, I'll turn it over the call to Jay and join you later for questions. Jay?\nJay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our third quarter 2023 financial results. I'll also provide an update to our full year 2023 guidance, and offer a few comments on 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Starting on Chart 4, with consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Third quarter sales increased 2% year-over-year with three of the four business areas delivering growth. Segment operating profit was down 6% year-over-year due to lower net favorable profit adjustments and lower equity earnings, resulting in segment margins of 10.7%. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS was comparable year-over-year, with lower segment profit and higher net interest expense offset by favorable below-the-line items, including lower share count, lower tax rate and fewer mark-to-market losses. On an adjusted basis, EPS was down $0.10 year-over-year, primarily due to the lower profit. Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. Our free cash flow was strong at over $2.5 billion in the quarter or 150% of net income, helped in part by our focus on working capital, primarily due to better collections at the end of the government fiscal year. Once again, we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning 99% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we've returned almost $5.3 billion or 116% of free cash flow. As Jim mentioned, our Board approved a 5% increase to the quarterly dividend and an additional $6 billion in share repurchase authorization. These tools remain a key part of our total shareholder return strategy. Okay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Third quarter sales at Aero decreased 5% driven by lower volume on F-35, partially offset by higher volume at Skunk Works. F-35 production was down due to the previously mentioned Lot 15 through 17 sales catch up in the third quarter of 2022, and an overall more linear throughput this year. Both development and sustainment saw solid year-over-year growth in the quarter. Operating profit decreased 12% from the prior year due to the lower volume and lower net profit adjustments. On the F-16 program, international interest remains strong. We delivered the second Block 70 aircraft to Bahrain in July and in September, the first Block 70 aircraft for the Slovak Republic was unveiled at our facility in Greenville, South Carolina. The Slovak Republic will be the first European country to receive this newest and most capable version of the Fighting Falcon. Today's latest version, the Block 772 will be flown by six countries and counting. With a backlog of 126 aircraft as of the third quarter, the F-16 program continues to play a crucial role in 21st Century security missions for international allies. It will be a key contributor to growth over the coming years. Shifting to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales increased 4% year-over-year driven by higher sales volumes on munitions programs within tactical strike missiles, partially offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense. Segment operating profit also increased 4% year-over-year due to the higher net profit adjustments. Margins were comparable at 13.5%. MSC has built a strong backlog and we continue to see strong demand for our missiles and munitions with allied nations seeking to improve the security posture amidst today's complex threat environment. This backlog provides a foundation for growth over the coming years across several of our product lines, including PAC-3, GMLRS, HIMARS, Javelin and JASSM and LRASM. Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9. Sales were up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors and C6ISR lines of business. Operating profit increased 2% due to higher sales volume and was partially offset by lower net profit adjustments. RMS backlog increased in the quarter, primarily due to the $2.7 billion CH-53K award, which is pictured for Lot 7 and 8, the first full rate production launch as part of the U.S. Marine Corps 200 aircraft program of record. This significant contract bolsters Sikorsky and its partners creates additional production efficiencies and provides the U.S. Marine Corps with transformative capabilities. On Chart 10, we continue to see strong growth across our space portfolio with sales increasing 8% year-over-year driven by higher volume on NGI, fleet ballistic missile, GPS and Orion programs. Operating profit decreased 15%, as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Space backlog grew slightly to over $30 billion at the end of the third quarter helped by the $800 million transport layer tranche two award for 36 beta satellites. Transport Layer is part of the proliferated space architecture and will strengthen deterrents with more resilient space architectures for beyond line of sight targeting, data transport and advanced missile detection and tracking. With this award, we will build and deliver a total of 88 data communication satellites to the Space Development Agency in support of their low-earth orbit constellations. Okay, now shifting to our 2023 expectations on Page 11. For the full year, we're holding the outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We've successfully driven and delivered more linear results in 2023 than prior years, which enables more efficient use of our capacity, but sets up for a difficult compares to last year's fourth quarter. In conjunction with our recent announcement of increased share repurchase authorization, we're increasing our share repurchase forecast for 2023 to $6 billion, provided there is not an extended shutdown scenario. These repurchases along with dividends, are expected to return nearly 150% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. And between 2022 and 2023, we are on track to repurchase nearly 13% of our current market cap. We're also set to deliver mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth in 2023, and we're positioning the company to continue that level of growth in the future. Okay. A few comments on 2024. While we don't have a formal outlook to share, I'll provide a few directional markers as we see them today, barring any environmental setbacks. We still anticipate low single-digit sales growth as we convert our strong backlog position. As I previously mentioned, the backlog supports a higher growth rate, but the value chain remains constrained by extended lead times that have yet to compress. On segment margins, we expect the underlying business to be relatively flat year-over-year, but anticipate variability caused by the timing of impacts from the MFC classified program. And at free cash flow, we're following the budget process to determine whether it will have an impact on the timing of our program schedules and milestones but are continuing to set internal targets that deliver mid-single-digit growth and free cash flow per share. Okay. Let's wrap it up. Results through the first three quarters have been solid with a long-term demand environment that is favorable to Lockheed Martin's 21st Century security capabilities. Our focus on linearity and working capital is helping to drive more consistent sales and improved cash flow. We're maintaining our full year outlook while increasing our planned share repurchases, further demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. And finally, we're executing our 21st Century security strategy through improving capacity and resilience in the defense enterprise, accelerating the adoption and insertion of 21st Century digital technologies, and collaborating more closely with international partners and allies to improve security solutions. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDoug Harned: Good morning. Thank you.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning, Doug.\nDoug Harned: I wanted to see if - just could I understand the F-35 situation a little bit more. Now the TR3 deliveries of F-35, those are now expected at some point in Q2 next year. But I think it's difficult for us to have like total confidence in that time frame. And what I'm trying to understand is as you continue to produce F-35s, which will need software upgrades before delivery, you're recognizing revenues on percent completion, so revenue should continue to be solid. But when you look at, say, a June delivery date, what's the impact on your production recognition of revenues, earnings and cash flow, should that date move around, how should we think about the timing here?\nJay Malave: So Doug, the timing on sales and the profits associated with the sales, the booking margin, I really shouldn't expect much variability with that. As we've mentioned, that really doesn't get impacted. What you could see and what we are seeing today is that our risk retirements are obviously dependent upon successful completion of the test program. And so that will - could limit our ability to take profit adjustments on a Lot 15 to 17 program. But as I've said in the past, we are performing and expect to continue to perform profitability stronger on Lot 15 to 17 than we did on Lot 12 through 14. And so we might see some short-term limitations on our ability to take profit rate adjustments, we still expect and have confidence will drive higher profitability on this contract lot than the prior one.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai Von Rumohr: Yes. Thanks so much. So Jay, I think recently, you made a comment about gravity on margins, and you haven't provided a guide for '24. But I think one of the issues that kind of you mentioned has been the classified missile program at MFC, where you have some LRIP options coming up. Could you maybe give us some color in terms of the status of that and how that impacts could impact next year? And any other items we should be watchful of that might exert gravity on margins? Thank you.\nJay Malave: Sure, Cai. Thanks. So yes, I mean, that's the question we've talked about. It's been a headwind. It's something that we've talked about for the upcoming number of years, including next year. And in fact, we are seeing some of the headwind this year, and it really - it's dependent upon an analysis really the timing of recognition of these losses. And there are certain things that need to be met from a performance standpoint on the program. And then it becomes an assessment on the probability of an option being exercised. And so there's just variability in that timing. It could be as early as, frankly, as this quarter, or into next quarter. What we could find ourselves in a situation is that we're recording multiple lots in 2024, which would put some downward pressure on next year's margins. So we'll have a better feel for that next year, and it could be in the range of anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points of headwind from where we are and where we end today or this year from a margin perspective. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of color on the impact of that program. Is that - as far as any others, look, we - if you look at this year, we had lower profit adjustments this year. We expect there to be in the low 20s in 2023. We're evaluating what that means for 2024 in general. But again, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting the underlying business to be pretty much flattish, which would include recurring margins as well as profit rate adjustments in 2024.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. And Cai, it's Jim. Just to add on the classified program. First of all, given my Air Force filed experience, I can tell you that this is a really important capability for the country. It should continue on as an important capability for many, many years and even decades, assuming the program is successful, which we think we're on track to be and it will be massively NPV positive over that longer time frame. So we're working our way through the schedule and the performance in the early phases of the contract, but at the end of the day, it will be worth it for the country and the company. But we will keep you all updated as Jay just did on the path to get there.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hi. Good morning, everyone. So maybe an F-35 question. We've seen a lot of new countries express interest in the F-35 and current partners like Israel, have indicated plans to add to existing orders. What are your thoughts on expanding capacity to meet all the international demand? And is there demand from the customers to potentially bring forward their deliveries? And should you increase capacity, what level of investments?\nJim Taiclet: So Kristine, it's Jim. I'll start off and Jay can maybe speak to the required investment level. We're in sync with our Joint Program Office customer, which represents the international cohort indirectly of the F-35 customer base and directly the U.S. services. We've all settled on the 156 per year rate as the joint investment that we're all willing to make, given the demand that's out there. There is the annual sort of slotting priorities discussion that happens within the Joint Program Office and the international partners, and that will keep the line full for many, many years. If we were to get significantly more international orders that might motivate us jointly, and I mean us meaning the government and industry, including our suppliers, by the way to make an incremental investment. But I think that, that would have to be a significant increase in the order book above what we see today. So Jay, any other...\nJay Malave: Yes. I mean, the investments, it's probably in the low hundreds of millions. It's manageable. But again, to Jim's point, it needs to be coordinated with the customer.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. Jay, on the F-35, can you discuss a little bit where we stood in the quarter in terms of sustainment revenue versus production because the decremental margin on the production was pretty high at 22%? And I'll sneak in one other one, which is in RMS, the implication is that you'd have a 14% margin in Q4 to meet your guide, yet revenues would be relatively flat. So if you can just kind of tell us what's going on to cause that to occur? Thanks.\nJay Malave: Okay. I'll start with the second one first on RMS margins and then come back on the F-35. On the margins for RMS, you're right, George, we're expecting an increase in profitability there. It's really a twofold function of higher profit adjustments. And there are - and I think I've talked about this in the past, we do have some mix benefits through some delivery - program deliveries here in the fourth quarter, which will give them some lift. As far as the F-35, just really from a sales perspective in the quarter, production was down pretty substantially, really close to 20%. Development was up quite substantially and sustainment was up in the high teens. So with solid there on sustainment, that's been strong all year long. We expect that to grow for the year around 10%.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Ron Epstein.\nJim Taiclet: Lois, are you still there?\nOperator: Yes. One moment. We're opening his line. I'm sorry, the next person that we will go to is David Straus from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning, David.\nDavid Strauss: Jay, I think the IRS came up with some recent updated guidance around Section 174. I want to see what your interpretation of that was, whether it's supported your position or your peers that are taking, I think, higher levels of - or a higher associated with Section 174. And then any updated thoughts on where pension might come out for you guys next year given what appears to be much higher discount rates and weak asset returns? Thanks.\nJay Malave: Sure. Thank you, David. The first one on the R&D capitalization, the draft guidelines that came out, we view those as promising. We believe that they support our position of continuing to deduct the costs associated with cost plus contracts. And just as you remember, we treat that and view it as a cost of sale, not really as an R&D activity. The risk is really borne by the acquirer of those services. The rights are short-lived and they're also restricted. And so we believe the draft language is, at least thus far, appears to be consistent with our approach. And so we view it positively. As far as pension, a couple of things going on with pension, I'll go on the P&L. FAS pension will see a significant reduction next year. We're going to go from about $375 million of income in '23 to about $50 million of loss in 2024. It's a function of two things. One is the returns. And the second is essentially the expiration of benefits that we're amortizing since - from the 2014 salary plan freeze. And so those run out, and so we'll see a significant increase. As you know, that's pretty much noncash, but it will affect EPS. On the cash side of it, we'll see a little bit of a slight reduction anywhere between $25 million to $50 million reduction. But again, the biggest piece there is on FAS. From a cash contribution, we talked about anywhere between $500 million to $1 billion of contributions required starting in 2025. Right now, given where things are, we would expect that to be in the higher range, if not higher for 2025. And if we stay where we are, it could trigger some contributions in 2024. But I will say, when you think about cash contribution to pension and what that means, we've got an enviable position in our balance sheet. We've demonstrated that we're willing to use it. And so I wouldn't view that higher pension contributions as limiting, otherwise limiting our ability to continue our cash deployment strategies, and that's the key point.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKen Herbert: Yes, hi. Good morning, Jay and Jim. Maybe, Jay, just to follow up on a comment you made in the prepared remarks. I think you made a comment around the buyback activity in the fourth quarter sort of dependent upon timing of the fiscal '24 budget and whether or not there is a shutdown potentially. Can you just talk about how you're thinking about the timing of the '24 budget, but very specifically, if there's any sort of shutdown, how much does that put at risk sort of the buyback activity expected in the fourth quarter? Or if it's very short, does that not impact me? Maybe you can walk through how you're viewing sort of the risks around that and impact on the fourth quarter cash deployment?\nJay Malave: Sure. So year-to-date, 0we've done $3 billion with this new guide at $6 billion, that's $3 billion in the fourth quarter. We're monitoring the status of the budget discussions and resolution of that. If we do find ourselves in a shutdown scenario, would cause us to take a pause in another relook at that share repurchase. And what we would probably do is just defer it, so it would be more of an issue of timing versus anything else until such time that the budget gets clarified. So history tells us, these things are fairly short-lived. We believe that we'll be able to get through it here in the fourth quarter. If not, then it would just push probably into the first quarter and the like and really won't see a meaningful impact there. But again, in a shutdown scenario, you just take a look at what does that mean. It does - you can't have new starts. It could be disrupted to programs. It could also put us in a situation where we're doing some self-funding to keep programs on track. And to the extent that occurs, it could be a limiting factor on share repurchase.\nOperator: The next question will come from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Sheila's line did drop from the Q&A. So we'll move to Rob Stallard, and he's from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Stallard: A question for Jim or Jay. On the balance sheet, you noted that you're returning more than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders at the moment. But we do have this ongoing U.S. budget uncertainty and you're going to put more money into the pension fund. So how sustainable do you think it is to be returning more than 100% to shareholders going forward?\nJay Malave: It's a good question. If you look at just the profile with this incremental authorization that we have, the way we're looking at it is $6 billion here in 2023, $4 billion in 2024 and then essentially $3 billion in '25 and $3 billion in '26, which puts us equal to free cash flow in that ballpark, assuming kind of a $6 billion placeholder offer free cash flow in those given years. And so that's the way we're viewing it, Rob. So over time, over the next few years, it will revert back to more of a 100% of free cash flow. But again, we'll look at it year-by-year. As you've seen in the last two years, we did increase it here in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities as they present themselves, the reality of what happens with actual pension funding, what progress we make in our working capital reduction initiatives and all those will go into the mix master and provide the inform what we formally do in any given year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question will come from the line of Richard Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nRichard Safran: Thanks. Jim, Jay, Maria, good morning. How are you?\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nRichard Safran: So if we take an optimistic scenario here on what happens with the budget outlook, I wanted to know if you could discuss the 2024 bookings and the opportunity set both classified and unclassified. Again, if we assume no shutdown and we assume to get funding, I'm interested in what the major competitions are next year is, what was - how you see backlog growth and the book-to-bill is better than 1?\nJay Malave: Richard, we've got a pretty decent line of sight to continuing growth in our backlog. There's a lot of activity happening in classified, which I can't speak to specifics about, but we do see some award decisions next year there. We'll continue to see orders strength in MFC over this time period. And we've talked about orders between 2023 and 2027 of $10 billion. We have not seen all of those orders come to fruition yet. So we would expect those to be continued opportunities for us. We'll continue to have F-35, so Lot 18 next year is probably something that we should probably consider coming into the backlog in 2024. In addition to the performance-based logistics program on the F-35 program, we've submitted our proposal to the customer. We continue to have dialogue. And we're cautiously optimistic that we can get under contract in the first half of next year. So those are some key awards to think about for 2024.\nRichard Safran: Thanks.\nJay Malave: Welcome.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Can you guys hear me?\nJim Taiclet: Yes. We can hear you fine, Sheila. Good morning.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks for taking the question. So just wanted to ask Jim and Jay, you're a pretty confident management team just given your big backlog, $150 billion. You're returning 150% to shareholders, which is a big number. So you've talked about low single-digit growth and 11% margins for some time. So I just kind of wanted to know what's changed given the backdrop is seemingly better, is it just a budget uncertainty? Is it supply chain? Is it F-35? Maybe if you can just comment on that.\nJay Malave: Well, not much has really changed, to be honest, we talked about low single digits for a while now. We - I talked about that in my prepared remarks. On the margins, underlying margin is generally flattish because we could be in a situation next year where we have multiple lots of the classified program, that could cause some variability. But that doesn't fundamentally alter what we've been really talking about. Same thing with free cash flow. We've been targeting mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth. And we still see a path there. We know there are some headwinds, whether it's pension and the like, but we still believe that that we have a line of sight to be able to do that. And that's what we're going to be working through on a year-by-year basis since starting with 2024 over the next couple of months. We'll work through, solidify our plans, and we'll present them formally to you in January.\nJim Taiclet: In the longer term, there are some things that are changing significantly. One is the global threat environment and the geopolitical situations getting more concerning and challenging. That's refocusing the U.S. and certainly our allies around the world on national defense in increasing manner. The second big trend that's going on is the continued evolution of both physical and digital technology at a rate never seen before serving human history, frankly. And so the opportunity for our company to take the leadership role in integrating those technologies, whether they're hypersonics, hypersonic defense, space technologies that are advanced as well as 5G, distributed cloud, artificial intelligence, we're investing in all those technologies to try to drive them in and pull through using this 21st Century concept, the technology driving concept we have is to pull through our platforms and enable them quickly on the open architecture that we're advocating for that will be quickly and widely adoptable, making our platforms more compelling as we go forward in time. And then the third thing is the notion that we have international defense strategy, and I think our allies are increasingly embracing is international cooperation, which drives interoperability and also linking command and control systems, all of which comport with our strategy. So I think there are some megatrends that are going on over a longer term that won't necessarily affect us quarter-to-quarter as Jay was stating, but will give us opportunities that I think the company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of over that long term.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Hi. Thanks very much and good morning, everyone.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nJay Malave: Good morning.\nSeth Seifman: Maybe, Jay, one quick housekeeping question and then one broader question for both of you. The mid-single-digit growth you talked about for free cash flow per share next year, did that assume any kind of pension contribution next year? And how big might that be or not? And then just more broadly, when you guys talk about seeking out additional suppliers of solid rocket motors, is that something for maybe developing hypersonics programs for late in the decade and into the 2030s? Or is that about replacing your suppliers on kind of today's existing programs? Thanks.\nJim Taiclet: I'll talk to solid rocket motors and Jay can take the free cash flow per share part of your question there. So our objective is to bring antifragility into our own supply chain first and to broadly apply that to the DoD in partnership with them as well. And so when it comes to solid rocket motors, I mean we're actually starting with GMLRS, for example, a legacy technology where we want to augment our existing supplier and have a dual source, frankly. And then that will extend into other systems, large and small and legacy in advance. So this is not a onetime objective. This is a broad, in a way, campaign like approach to strengthening our own supply chain and enabling multiple sources really for even beyond our company for our industry, which I think is important. So I do think that this is not a one-shot deal. We're in negotiations and discussions with a counterparty. We think we can start us off with on this journey, but it's going to be a long journey, and we'll probably have additional participants and programs as the years and even decades roll on.\nJay Malave: On the question of the free cash flow per share for 2024, Seth, what I mentioned is that we're setting up internal targeting and internal actions to be able to arrive at that incremental. Pension contribution would obviously put pressure on that. And we'll go through that over the next coming months and determine what the art of what's possible and what our plans would be, and again we'll present that in January.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Jay, a quick clarification and then a question for Jim. The clarification on the margins for next year, 25 to 50 basis points of risk, I guess, is what you're seeing on the MFC. Should we anticipate that there's a way around that? Or is that the base case? And then, Jim, in the press release, you talked about digital services revenue over time. And I'm just curious, maybe you could touch on your vision of what digital services revenue is today and where you want to take it over the next several years?\nJim Taiclet: So digital services will be a wide range, but we're starting with this notion of trusted, reliable mission systems engineering for command and control and battle management systems. That is a business we're already in, actually. It is largely digital already. And it's these kind of programs like Defense of Guam. We have a program in the UAE that's based on this technology as well called DIAMONDShield. We're using that core technology to then expand into other programs like AIR6500. So we're already in that business. It's in, I think, the mid-low to mid-single-digit billions at this point. And we're going to try to ramp that up in and of itself, add other technologies to that for networking, connecting again our platforms as well as other platforms from other OEMs to provide mission solutions for the DoD. So the digital and the physical technologies will ultimately come together in a way that can advance mission capability for our customers in, say, air-to-air combat, surface warfare, et cetera, and air and missile defense integration. Those kinds of missions, we want to advance every three to six months of the combination of digital and physical technologies of our own and from others, partners, etc., that we will work with. So this is, again, long-term broad approach, but we've already got a very, very good starting point that's material in the command and control and battle management systems that we have today and how we're augmenting them and modernizing those for the future.\nJay Malave: Okay. Going back to the question on margins for next year. Just as I mentioned, underlying margins, and let me for sake of clarity, margins, excluding the impact of the MFC program, we expect to be flattish. The MFC programs, it will provide a drag on the margins next year, and it's a question of timing. So it could be anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points. And again, we'll have a lot more clarity on that as we close out the year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hello, everyone.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nJay Malave: Hi.\nNoah Poponak: Jay, I guess I also wanted to ask about margins, and you sort of did there, but I don't know if you would just state where you expect the MFC margin to shake out for the year next year or what it looks like in the quarters with the more concentrated losses? And then I just wondered if you could talk about how - a little bit more about how this got here. I know you've talked about having the fixed price LRIPs here with prices fixed a little while ago. Was - is that something that's been going on longer than I realized? I know you - my understanding is you also no bid missile program that was awarded recently because it had fixed price development. Is the customer shifting the risk a little bit towards the contractor? Or am I overreading what I'm seeing out there?\nJay Malave: Well, let me maybe take the second part of it and then circle back. There are really two different programs. I think you're referring to the standard Stand-in Attack Weapon award, and that was a fixed price development program that we decided not to pursue because of the risk posture over there. And each program and pursuit really stands on its own, and we review those individually. In this case, we thought the risk profile was just too much. And so we backed off. On this particular program, on the classified program, that was a cost-plus development program. So there really was not much risk associated what the development cycle. There are these production low rate initial production lots that were priced pretty aggressively. And hence, we're starting - we're going to start to see the headwinds associated with that. As Jim mentioned, these are - this would be a long-term program. And we know what it takes to make sure that we provide accretive NPV on these types of programs. And so we track that and monitoring that, and we're confident over the long term, we'll be able to deliver that. So again, these are case-by-case type of situations that we pursue. On the - we'll probably have to get back to you on the specific MFC margins for next year. I think we can back into 25 to 50 on the total company, you can back into what that impact is for MFC. But I just don't have it in front of me.\nJim Taiclet: And Noah, just to give you context here, the approach we're taking no matter what the customer's initiative is on risk balancing or imbalancing, the approach that Jay and I are taking here, as we look at programs going forward and opportunities is really a holistic one where we do take the long-term total program value into account, but we also take - we'll take into account seriously short and midterm risk management. And especially when it comes to fixed price either development or initial rate production because if you look at the concept of fixed price initial rate production on a program, this technology is not settled in the first place yet because the development hasn't been done. We would ascribe a higher risk factor to that I think, going forward here based on both experience and just our own perspectives on these kinds of things.\nMaria Ricciardone Lee: Okay. And Lois, I think we have time for one more as we approach the top of the hour.\nOperator: Thank you so much. And that question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Gursky: Yes. Good morning, everybody. Jim, you mentioned in your prepared remarks, the idea of a supplemental for Taiwan. I'm wondering if you would do us a favor, just kind of remind us of what you're shipping into Taiwan today. And in the context of a supplemental, what kinds of things do you think are going to be in high demand and would lead to more revenue for you all? And then Jay, related to international here, I was wondering if you could just give us a quick update on the margin profile of your international business, kind of writ large today outside the F-35 program. If international is growing faster, is the expectation here that we would, all else be equal, see margin expansion in light of international historically being higher margin than domestic business? Thanks.\nJim Taiclet: Jason, on Taiwan, I think the signature program that everybody is aware of is F-16 in both production and modernization. So that's ongoing. But we also provided a kind of comprehensive defensive Taiwan, like Defense of Guam award we won last year, approach to integrating these digital technologies with the aircraft available that we provide and others, the missile systems that we provide and others and integrate them into sort of this porcupine approach to defending Taiwan just like we're designing for Guam. So there could be a wide range of digital and physical products that would come with this over time. The U.S. government will help define with the Taiwanese government, what, when if any of those will be procured and released for export to Taiwan to the FMS program and other vehicles. So I can't speak for the government as to what that will look like. But I think it's, again, a possibility that given the rising tensions there could be supplementals for Taiwan in addition to, as we said, Israel and Ukraine.\nJay Malave: And on the international margins, historically, the margins have been higher than they are for U.S. government customers. But in this case, it's so what I would expect the base business to continue this higher margin. But a lot of the incremental opportunities that we've been talking about are really going through foreign military sales contracting which are more like U.S. DoD-type margins. And so while we will see kind of a net blended margin profile that's probably higher than the kind of base U.S. DoD, it will be limited - at least the incremental business is going to be limited because they are FMS.\nMaria Ricciardone Lee: All right. Great. Thanks, everybody. So I think we're at the top of the hour. I'll turn the call back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\nJim Taiclet: Sure. Thanks, Maria. I think before we conclude today, I do want to thank all of our employees around the world and across the country for their continued dedication. They're supporting our signature programs. They're going after new pursuits, advancing these digital technologies. And all that together will really enhance deterrents globally, especially in the more sort of dangerous world we live in. I want to really congratulate and thank our teams for everything they're doing. We also want to make sure that the shareholders are reminded yet again that everything we're doing here is designed to deliver a compelling value to you all for many years to come. Jay and I really focus on free cash flow per share, along with the dividend to make sure that you're getting an interesting return over time, and we're trying to expand the business as we go as well. So thank you again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you on our next earnings call in January. And Lois, that concludes the call for this morning. Bye-bye.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Event Conference, and you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Maria, and good morning, everyone. Thank you all for joining us on our third quarter 2023 earnings call. All of us on the line today are well aware that since our last call, the world is now seeing yet another terrible conflict. Everyone in our company remains dedicated to fully supporting the United States government's policy and efforts to deter aggression, restore security and achieve peace. Today, I will first highlight our third quarter results as we pursue our vision of 21st Century Security, designed to support the U.S. Department of Defense Strategy of Integrated deterrents and then I'll turn it over to Jay to provide additional detail before taking your questions. Starting on Page 3 of the slides. Sales increased 2% year-over-year to $16.9 billion and backlog remains at historically high levels at $156 million. EPS of $6.73 exceeded prior year and free cash flow was a strong $2.5 billion. We returned approximately 100% of free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases during the quarter. Earlier in October, we announced a $0.15 increase in our dividend which reflects 5% growth and is the 21st consecutive year of dividend increases for Lockheed Martin. At the same time, our Board also approved a $6 billion increase in our share repurchase authorization, bringing our total authorization to $13 billion, reconfirming our continued commitment to returning capital to shareholders. We are also reaffirming our full year 2023 financial outlook for sales, profit, EPS and free cash flow. Given the current status of the 2024 U.S. defense budget, global geopolitical tensions and the macroeconomic environment, we will provide our expectations for our 2024 financial outlook during our full year 2023 earnings call in January. On the U.S. budget, though the specific trajectory of the future U.S. defense budget is still in process between the administration and Congress, the global threat landscape is increasingly elevated. Our robust backlog reflects the relevance and importance of the Lockheed Martin portfolio and elevating deterrence to great power conflict involving the United States and its allies and the solid positioning of our business to serve our domestic and international customers. From a process standpoint and government, the current continuing resolution or CR is in place through November 17. At that point, one of the following could occur. FY '24 appropriations bills will be enacted, Congress will enact another partial or whole CR or there could be a partial or full government shutdown. In any of these scenarios, there continues to be the option also for supplemental requests related to support Ukraine, Israel and potentially Taiwan. As Congress continues to work through the FY '24 appropriations bills, we are optimistic that there will be consistent support for the National Defense strategy and funding for its priorities. In the meantime, we will continue to work with our customers and suppliers to minimize any potential disruptions due to the process. And we will press on with executing our 21st Century security strategy of building capacity, efficiency and resilience into our production operations, driving advanced digital technologies to enhance integrated deterrents and expanding our international business and operations. Turning to the F-35 program. We delivered 30 F-35 aircraft in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to 80 jets. Consistent with our announcement in September, we continue to expect to deliver a total of 97 aircraft this year, all in the Technology Refresh 2 or TR2 configuration. We are producing F-35s at a rate of 156 per year, and expect to continue at that pace while simultaneously working to finalize TR3 software development testing. And we recently began flight test evaluations of the next software release that encompasses major systems upgrades such as improved RADAR, next-gen distributed aperture system and weapons capability. As previously announced, we continue to expect to deliver the first TR3 configured aircraft between April and June of 2024. The superior technological capabilities of the F-35 continue to generate strong interest both domestically and internationally. In September, Denmark's first four locally based F-35 aircraft arrived on their home soil. Denmark's program of record calls for 27 F-35A aircraft. Also in September, the Czech Republic chose to become part of the global F-35 Lightning II program, and the U.S. State Department approved a possible $5 billion foreign military sale to South Korea for up to 25 F-35 Joint Strike Fighters. Earlier in the quarter, Israel announced that we'll buy an additional 25 F-35, which will add a third squadron and increased its F-35 fleet to 75 aircraft. Additionally, in August, Lockheed Martin was selected by the Australian Department of Defense, as their strategic partner for their Air 6500 program Phase 1. This transformational Pathfinder program will deliver the broadest scope of Joint All Domain Operations, JADO in the free world, and will completely revolutionize the way the Australian defense force operates. By connecting Australian systems and platforms that operate across air, space, land, sea and cyber domains, we expect that Air 6500 will set the blueprint for future military operations worldwide. This proven technology will provide greater situational awareness and defense against increasingly advanced air and missile threats and enables significantly greater interoperability between Australia and allied nations. Lockheed Martin will lead this first phase which will provide the core architecture and multi-domain integration for the program. This is just one recent win that demonstrates the business success of our 21st Century security cornerstone, trusted and reliable battle management and command and control systems that integrate across multiple domains, military services and allied forces. Late last year, Lockheed Martin also won the $500 million Defense of Guam award. And in late September, we were also awarded a potential seven-year, over $1 billion contract for systems engineering and software integration to the integrated combat system across the surface force portfolio of the U.S. Navy and Coast Guard. This will link together systems and software across the services and a JADO construct and it not only enables faster decision-making and better capabilities but also serves as a much more effective global deterrent strategy. Beyond these awards, we continue to develop 21st Century security technologies to advance interoperability between Lockheed Martin product lines. The 5G.MIL hybrid base station that our engineers invented is the 1 LM initiative that includes teams at MFC and Aeronautics. We recently transferred data from a sniper targeting pod that was set up in Orlando, Florida to the Tactical Missile Simulation Lab in Grand Prairie, Texas to provide real-time updates to a simulated missile in-flight. This event significantly advanced efforts towards upcoming live fire demonstrations across the main platforms operating in a joint environment that will use data from multiple sources across an open architecture. Also, Skunk Works partnered with the University of Iowa's Operator Performance Laboratory to demonstrate an AI commanded jamming capability. In this, we successfully used artificial intelligence on two air systems to provide jamming support to a simulated strike against enemy air defenses. This demonstration showed how AI agents with high performance and reliable behavior can operate in close coordination with and be controlled by human crude aircraft. We also conducted a successful test of the prototype radio for the PAC-3 MSC missile that will enable communications with the SPY-1 radar, the key sensor in the Aegis Weapon System. This test performed by a 1 LM team across MFC and RMS paves the way for the design of a multifrequency radio data link for PAC-3 MSC. In turn, that will enable the U.S. Navy for the first time to have the ability to integrate the state-of-the-art PAC-3 missile onto its warships and open up another opportunity for Lockheed Martin in the future. International interest in PAC-3 also remains strong. As demonstrated by our deepening partnership with Poland, which signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 644 PAC-3 MSCs and related equipment in the quarter. In our RMS business, Sikorsky CH-53K helicopter is expected to grow meaningfully also over the coming years. In August, we won a $2.7 billion contract to build and deliver 35 additional CH-53K helicopters and it's the largest procurement to date for this multi-mission aircraft. Another longstanding major Lockheed Martin program, this one is space is also poised for significant growth ramp. In late September, the Fleet Ballistic Missile program won a $1.2 billion contract for the Navy's Trident II D5 life extension. For nearly seven decades, Lockheed Martin has supported the U.S. Navy as a critical partner for its mission to provide sea-based strategic deterrents. The TRIDENT II D5 LE missile will be in service through the 2040s, maintaining the proven performance of the D5 system for significantly less cost to the government than of designing a new missile. Also in our Space business, Lockheed Martin's Next Generation Interceptor or NGI program, executed its digital preliminary design review in partnership with the Missile Defense Agency customer. That happened on September 29. During this review, the MDA assessed the NGI program's readiness and maturity to continue into the detailed design phase, confirming that our solution continues to meet the requirements for this crucial and demanding mission. Finally, the OSIRIS-REx Sample Return Capsule touched down in the Utah Desert on September 24, returning NASA's first ever sample from an asteroid. After a seven-year mission traveling approximately, I believe is 4 billion miles in space. The capsule holds material from Bennu, a carbon-rich asteroid and scientists hope it will teach us more about the origins of organics that led to life on earth, plus the mechanics behind overall planet formation After release of the capsule, the spacecraft was set on a new course to investigate the asteroid Apophis under the mission name OSIRIS-REx. So with that interesting and exciting news, I'll turn it over the call to Jay and join you later for questions. Jay? Good morning, Doug. Yes. And Cai, it's Jim. Just to add on the classified program. First of all, given my Air Force filed experience, I can tell you that this is a really important capability for the country. It should continue on as an important capability for many, many years and even decades, assuming the program is successful, which we think we're on track to be and it will be massively NPV positive over that longer time frame. So we're working our way through the schedule and the performance in the early phases of the contract, but at the end of the day, it will be worth it for the country and the company. But we will keep you all updated as Jay just did on the path to get there. So Kristine, it's Jim. I'll start off and Jay can maybe speak to the required investment level. We're in sync with our Joint Program Office customer, which represents the international cohort indirectly of the F-35 customer base and directly the U.S. services. We've all settled on the 156 per year rate as the joint investment that we're all willing to make, given the demand that's out there. There is the annual sort of slotting priorities discussion that happens within the Joint Program Office and the international partners, and that will keep the line full for many, many years. If we were to get significantly more international orders that might motivate us jointly, and I mean us meaning the government and industry, including our suppliers, by the way to make an incremental investment. But I think that, that would have to be a significant increase in the order book above what we see today. So Jay, any other... Lois, are you still there? Good morning, David. Good morning, Rob. Good morning. Yes. We can hear you fine, Sheila. Good morning. In the longer term, there are some things that are changing significantly. One is the global threat environment and the geopolitical situations getting more concerning and challenging. That's refocusing the U.S. and certainly our allies around the world on national defense in increasing manner. The second big trend that's going on is the continued evolution of both physical and digital technology at a rate never seen before serving human history, frankly. And so the opportunity for our company to take the leadership role in integrating those technologies, whether they're hypersonics, hypersonic defense, space technologies that are advanced as well as 5G, distributed cloud, artificial intelligence, we're investing in all those technologies to try to drive them in and pull through using this 21st Century concept, the technology driving concept we have is to pull through our platforms and enable them quickly on the open architecture that we're advocating for that will be quickly and widely adoptable, making our platforms more compelling as we go forward in time. And then the third thing is the notion that we have international defense strategy, and I think our allies are increasingly embracing is international cooperation, which drives interoperability and also linking command and control systems, all of which comport with our strategy. So I think there are some megatrends that are going on over a longer term that won't necessarily affect us quarter-to-quarter as Jay was stating, but will give us opportunities that I think the company is uniquely positioned to take advantage of over that long term. Good morning. I'll talk to solid rocket motors and Jay can take the free cash flow per share part of your question there. So our objective is to bring antifragility into our own supply chain first and to broadly apply that to the DoD in partnership with them as well. And so when it comes to solid rocket motors, I mean we're actually starting with GMLRS, for example, a legacy technology where we want to augment our existing supplier and have a dual source, frankly. And then that will extend into other systems, large and small and legacy in advance. So this is not a onetime objective. This is a broad, in a way, campaign like approach to strengthening our own supply chain and enabling multiple sources really for even beyond our company for our industry, which I think is important. So I do think that this is not a one-shot deal. We're in negotiations and discussions with a counterparty. We think we can start us off with on this journey, but it's going to be a long journey, and we'll probably have additional participants and programs as the years and even decades roll on. So digital services will be a wide range, but we're starting with this notion of trusted, reliable mission systems engineering for command and control and battle management systems. That is a business we're already in, actually. It is largely digital already. And it's these kind of programs like Defense of Guam. We have a program in the UAE that's based on this technology as well called DIAMONDShield. We're using that core technology to then expand into other programs like AIR6500. So we're already in that business. It's in, I think, the mid-low to mid-single-digit billions at this point. And we're going to try to ramp that up in and of itself, add other technologies to that for networking, connecting again our platforms as well as other platforms from other OEMs to provide mission solutions for the DoD. So the digital and the physical technologies will ultimately come together in a way that can advance mission capability for our customers in, say, air-to-air combat, surface warfare, et cetera, and air and missile defense integration. Those kinds of missions, we want to advance every three to six months of the combination of digital and physical technologies of our own and from others, partners, etc., that we will work with. So this is, again, long-term broad approach, but we've already got a very, very good starting point that's material in the command and control and battle management systems that we have today and how we're augmenting them and modernizing those for the future. Good morning. And Noah, just to give you context here, the approach we're taking no matter what the customer's initiative is on risk balancing or imbalancing, the approach that Jay and I are taking here, as we look at programs going forward and opportunities is really a holistic one where we do take the long-term total program value into account, but we also take - we'll take into account seriously short and midterm risk management. And especially when it comes to fixed price either development or initial rate production because if you look at the concept of fixed price initial rate production on a program, this technology is not settled in the first place yet because the development hasn't been done. We would ascribe a higher risk factor to that I think, going forward here based on both experience and just our own perspectives on these kinds of things. Jason, on Taiwan, I think the signature program that everybody is aware of is F-16 in both production and modernization. So that's ongoing. But we also provided a kind of comprehensive defensive Taiwan, like Defense of Guam award we won last year, approach to integrating these digital technologies with the aircraft available that we provide and others, the missile systems that we provide and others and integrate them into sort of this porcupine approach to defending Taiwan just like we're designing for Guam. So there could be a wide range of digital and physical products that would come with this over time. The U.S. government will help define with the Taiwanese government, what, when if any of those will be procured and released for export to Taiwan to the FMS program and other vehicles. So I can't speak for the government as to what that will look like. But I think it's, again, a possibility that given the rising tensions there could be supplementals for Taiwan in addition to, as we said, Israel and Ukraine. Sure. Thanks, Maria. I think before we conclude today, I do want to thank all of our employees around the world and across the country for their continued dedication. They're supporting our signature programs. They're going after new pursuits, advancing these digital technologies. And all that together will really enhance deterrents globally, especially in the more sort of dangerous world we live in. I want to really congratulate and thank our teams for everything they're doing. We also want to make sure that the shareholders are reminded yet again that everything we're doing here is designed to deliver a compelling value to you all for many years to come. Jay and I really focus on free cash flow per share, along with the dividend to make sure that you're getting an interesting return over time, and we're trying to expand the business as we go as well. So thank you again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with all of you on our next earnings call in January. And Lois, that concludes the call for this morning. Bye-bye."

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our third quarter 2023 financial results. I'll also provide an update to our full year 2023 guidance, and offer a few comments on 2024. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Starting on Chart 4, with consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Third quarter sales increased 2% year-over-year with three of the four business areas delivering growth. Segment operating profit was down 6% year-over-year due to lower net favorable profit adjustments and lower equity earnings, resulting in segment margins of 10.7%. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 5. GAAP EPS was comparable year-over-year, with lower segment profit and higher net interest expense offset by favorable below-the-line items, including lower share count, lower tax rate and fewer mark-to-market losses. On an adjusted basis, EPS was down $0.10 year-over-year, primarily due to the lower profit. Moving to cash flow on Chart 6. Our free cash flow was strong at over $2.5 billion in the quarter or 150% of net income, helped in part by our focus on working capital, primarily due to better collections at the end of the government fiscal year. Once again, we demonstrated our commitment to shareholders by returning 99% of our free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases this quarter. On a year-to-date basis, we've returned almost $5.3 billion or 116% of free cash flow. As Jim mentioned, our Board approved a 5% increase to the quarterly dividend and an additional $6 billion in share repurchase authorization. These tools remain a key part of our total shareholder return strategy. Okay. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on Chart 7. Third quarter sales at Aero decreased 5% driven by lower volume on F-35, partially offset by higher volume at Skunk Works. F-35 production was down due to the previously mentioned Lot 15 through 17 sales catch up in the third quarter of 2022, and an overall more linear throughput this year. Both development and sustainment saw solid year-over-year growth in the quarter. Operating profit decreased 12% from the prior year due to the lower volume and lower net profit adjustments. On the F-16 program, international interest remains strong. We delivered the second Block 70 aircraft to Bahrain in July and in September, the first Block 70 aircraft for the Slovak Republic was unveiled at our facility in Greenville, South Carolina. The Slovak Republic will be the first European country to receive this newest and most capable version of the Fighting Falcon. Today's latest version, the Block 772 will be flown by six countries and counting. With a backlog of 126 aircraft as of the third quarter, the F-16 program continues to play a crucial role in 21st Century security missions for international allies. It will be a key contributor to growth over the coming years. Shifting to Missiles and Fire Control on Page 8. Sales increased 4% year-over-year driven by higher sales volumes on munitions programs within tactical strike missiles, partially offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense. Segment operating profit also increased 4% year-over-year due to the higher net profit adjustments. Margins were comparable at 13.5%. MSC has built a strong backlog and we continue to see strong demand for our missiles and munitions with allied nations seeking to improve the security posture amidst today's complex threat environment. This backlog provides a foundation for growth over the coming years across several of our product lines, including PAC-3, GMLRS, HIMARS, Javelin and JASSM and LRASM. Turning to Rotary and Mission Systems on Page 9. Sales were up 9% in the quarter, driven by higher volume across a handful of programs within our integrated warfare systems and sensors and C6ISR lines of business. Operating profit increased 2% due to higher sales volume and was partially offset by lower net profit adjustments. RMS backlog increased in the quarter, primarily due to the $2.7 billion CH-53K award, which is pictured for Lot 7 and 8, the first full rate production launch as part of the U.S. Marine Corps 200 aircraft program of record. This significant contract bolsters Sikorsky and its partners creates additional production efficiencies and provides the U.S. Marine Corps with transformative capabilities. On Chart 10, we continue to see strong growth across our space portfolio with sales increasing 8% year-over-year driven by higher volume on NGI, fleet ballistic missile, GPS and Orion programs. Operating profit decreased 15%, as the benefit from higher sales volume was more than offset by lower net profit adjustments and lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Space backlog grew slightly to over $30 billion at the end of the third quarter helped by the $800 million transport layer tranche two award for 36 beta satellites. Transport Layer is part of the proliferated space architecture and will strengthen deterrents with more resilient space architectures for beyond line of sight targeting, data transport and advanced missile detection and tracking. With this award, we will build and deliver a total of 88 data communication satellites to the Space Development Agency in support of their low-earth orbit constellations. Okay, now shifting to our 2023 expectations on Page 11. For the full year, we're holding the outlook for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We've successfully driven and delivered more linear results in 2023 than prior years, which enables more efficient use of our capacity, but sets up for a difficult compares to last year's fourth quarter. In conjunction with our recent announcement of increased share repurchase authorization, we're increasing our share repurchase forecast for 2023 to $6 billion, provided there is not an extended shutdown scenario. These repurchases along with dividends, are expected to return nearly 150% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. And between 2022 and 2023, we are on track to repurchase nearly 13% of our current market cap. We're also set to deliver mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth in 2023, and we're positioning the company to continue that level of growth in the future. Okay. A few comments on 2024. While we don't have a formal outlook to share, I'll provide a few directional markers as we see them today, barring any environmental setbacks. We still anticipate low single-digit sales growth as we convert our strong backlog position. As I previously mentioned, the backlog supports a higher growth rate, but the value chain remains constrained by extended lead times that have yet to compress. On segment margins, we expect the underlying business to be relatively flat year-over-year, but anticipate variability caused by the timing of impacts from the MFC classified program. And at free cash flow, we're following the budget process to determine whether it will have an impact on the timing of our program schedules and milestones but are continuing to set internal targets that deliver mid-single-digit growth and free cash flow per share. Okay. Let's wrap it up. Results through the first three quarters have been solid with a long-term demand environment that is favorable to Lockheed Martin's 21st Century security capabilities. Our focus on linearity and working capital is helping to drive more consistent sales and improved cash flow. We're maintaining our full year outlook while increasing our planned share repurchases, further demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. And finally, we're executing our 21st Century security strategy through improving capacity and resilience in the defense enterprise, accelerating the adoption and insertion of 21st Century digital technologies, and collaborating more closely with international partners and allies to improve security solutions. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A. So Doug, the timing on sales and the profits associated with the sales, the booking margin, I really shouldn't expect much variability with that. As we've mentioned, that really doesn't get impacted. What you could see and what we are seeing today is that our risk retirements are obviously dependent upon successful completion of the test program. And so that will - could limit our ability to take profit adjustments on a Lot 15 to 17 program. But as I've said in the past, we are performing and expect to continue to perform profitability stronger on Lot 15 to 17 than we did on Lot 12 through 14. And so we might see some short-term limitations on our ability to take profit rate adjustments, we still expect and have confidence will drive higher profitability on this contract lot than the prior one. Sure, Cai. Thanks. So yes, I mean, that's the question we've talked about. It's been a headwind. It's something that we've talked about for the upcoming number of years, including next year. And in fact, we are seeing some of the headwind this year, and it really - it's dependent upon an analysis really the timing of recognition of these losses. And there are certain things that need to be met from a performance standpoint on the program. And then it becomes an assessment on the probability of an option being exercised. And so there's just variability in that timing. It could be as early as, frankly, as this quarter, or into next quarter. What we could find ourselves in a situation is that we're recording multiple lots in 2024, which would put some downward pressure on next year's margins. So we'll have a better feel for that next year, and it could be in the range of anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points of headwind from where we are and where we end today or this year from a margin perspective. So hopefully, that provides a little bit of color on the impact of that program. Is that - as far as any others, look, we - if you look at this year, we had lower profit adjustments this year. We expect there to be in the low 20s in 2023. We're evaluating what that means for 2024 in general. But again, I think, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're expecting the underlying business to be pretty much flattish, which would include recurring margins as well as profit rate adjustments in 2024. Yes. I mean, the investments, it's probably in the low hundreds of millions. It's manageable. But again, to Jim's point, it needs to be coordinated with the customer. Okay. I'll start with the second one first on RMS margins and then come back on the F-35. On the margins for RMS, you're right, George, we're expecting an increase in profitability there. It's really a twofold function of higher profit adjustments. And there are - and I think I've talked about this in the past, we do have some mix benefits through some delivery - program deliveries here in the fourth quarter, which will give them some lift. As far as the F-35, just really from a sales perspective in the quarter, production was down pretty substantially, really close to 20%. Development was up quite substantially and sustainment was up in the high teens. So with solid there on sustainment, that's been strong all year long. We expect that to grow for the year around 10%. Sure. Thank you, David. The first one on the R&D capitalization, the draft guidelines that came out, we view those as promising. We believe that they support our position of continuing to deduct the costs associated with cost plus contracts. And just as you remember, we treat that and view it as a cost of sale, not really as an R&D activity. The risk is really borne by the acquirer of those services. The rights are short-lived and they're also restricted. And so we believe the draft language is, at least thus far, appears to be consistent with our approach. And so we view it positively. As far as pension, a couple of things going on with pension, I'll go on the P&L. FAS pension will see a significant reduction next year. We're going to go from about $375 million of income in '23 to about $50 million of loss in 2024. It's a function of two things. One is the returns. And the second is essentially the expiration of benefits that we're amortizing since - from the 2014 salary plan freeze. And so those run out, and so we'll see a significant increase. As you know, that's pretty much noncash, but it will affect EPS. On the cash side of it, we'll see a little bit of a slight reduction anywhere between $25 million to $50 million reduction. But again, the biggest piece there is on FAS. From a cash contribution, we talked about anywhere between $500 million to $1 billion of contributions required starting in 2025. Right now, given where things are, we would expect that to be in the higher range, if not higher for 2025. And if we stay where we are, it could trigger some contributions in 2024. But I will say, when you think about cash contribution to pension and what that means, we've got an enviable position in our balance sheet. We've demonstrated that we're willing to use it. And so I wouldn't view that higher pension contributions as limiting, otherwise limiting our ability to continue our cash deployment strategies, and that's the key point. Sure. So year-to-date, 0we've done $3 billion with this new guide at $6 billion, that's $3 billion in the fourth quarter. We're monitoring the status of the budget discussions and resolution of that. If we do find ourselves in a shutdown scenario, would cause us to take a pause in another relook at that share repurchase. And what we would probably do is just defer it, so it would be more of an issue of timing versus anything else until such time that the budget gets clarified. So history tells us, these things are fairly short-lived. We believe that we'll be able to get through it here in the fourth quarter. If not, then it would just push probably into the first quarter and the like and really won't see a meaningful impact there. But again, in a shutdown scenario, you just take a look at what does that mean. It does - you can't have new starts. It could be disrupted to programs. It could also put us in a situation where we're doing some self-funding to keep programs on track. And to the extent that occurs, it could be a limiting factor on share repurchase. It's a good question. If you look at just the profile with this incremental authorization that we have, the way we're looking at it is $6 billion here in 2023, $4 billion in 2024 and then essentially $3 billion in '25 and $3 billion in '26, which puts us equal to free cash flow in that ballpark, assuming kind of a $6 billion placeholder offer free cash flow in those given years. And so that's the way we're viewing it, Rob. So over time, over the next few years, it will revert back to more of a 100% of free cash flow. But again, we'll look at it year-by-year. As you've seen in the last two years, we did increase it here in the fourth quarter, and we'll continue to evaluate those opportunities as they present themselves, the reality of what happens with actual pension funding, what progress we make in our working capital reduction initiatives and all those will go into the mix master and provide the inform what we formally do in any given year. Richard, we've got a pretty decent line of sight to continuing growth in our backlog. There's a lot of activity happening in classified, which I can't speak to specifics about, but we do see some award decisions next year there. We'll continue to see orders strength in MFC over this time period. And we've talked about orders between 2023 and 2027 of $10 billion. We have not seen all of those orders come to fruition yet. So we would expect those to be continued opportunities for us. We'll continue to have F-35, so Lot 18 next year is probably something that we should probably consider coming into the backlog in 2024. In addition to the performance-based logistics program on the F-35 program, we've submitted our proposal to the customer. We continue to have dialogue. And we're cautiously optimistic that we can get under contract in the first half of next year. So those are some key awards to think about for 2024. Welcome. Well, not much has really changed, to be honest, we talked about low single digits for a while now. We - I talked about that in my prepared remarks. On the margins, underlying margin is generally flattish because we could be in a situation next year where we have multiple lots of the classified program, that could cause some variability. But that doesn't fundamentally alter what we've been really talking about. Same thing with free cash flow. We've been targeting mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth. And we still see a path there. We know there are some headwinds, whether it's pension and the like, but we still believe that that we have a line of sight to be able to do that. And that's what we're going to be working through on a year-by-year basis since starting with 2024 over the next couple of months. We'll work through, solidify our plans, and we'll present them formally to you in January. Good morning. On the question of the free cash flow per share for 2024, Seth, what I mentioned is that we're setting up internal targeting and internal actions to be able to arrive at that incremental. Pension contribution would obviously put pressure on that. And we'll go through that over the next coming months and determine what the art of what's possible and what our plans would be, and again we'll present that in January. Okay. Going back to the question on margins for next year. Just as I mentioned, underlying margins, and let me for sake of clarity, margins, excluding the impact of the MFC program, we expect to be flattish. The MFC programs, it will provide a drag on the margins next year, and it's a question of timing. So it could be anywhere between 25 to 50 basis points. And again, we'll have a lot more clarity on that as we close out the year. Hi. Well, let me maybe take the second part of it and then circle back. There are really two different programs. I think you're referring to the standard Stand-in Attack Weapon award, and that was a fixed price development program that we decided not to pursue because of the risk posture over there. And each program and pursuit really stands on its own, and we review those individually. In this case, we thought the risk profile was just too much. And so we backed off. On this particular program, on the classified program, that was a cost-plus development program. So there really was not much risk associated what the development cycle. There are these production low rate initial production lots that were priced pretty aggressively. And hence, we're starting - we're going to start to see the headwinds associated with that. As Jim mentioned, these are - this would be a long-term program. And we know what it takes to make sure that we provide accretive NPV on these types of programs. And so we track that and monitoring that, and we're confident over the long term, we'll be able to deliver that. So again, these are case-by-case type of situations that we pursue. On the - we'll probably have to get back to you on the specific MFC margins for next year. I think we can back into 25 to 50 on the total company, you can back into what that impact is for MFC. But I just don't have it in front of me. And on the international margins, historically, the margins have been higher than they are for U.S. government customers. But in this case, it's so what I would expect the base business to continue this higher margin. But a lot of the incremental opportunities that we've been talking about are really going through foreign military sales contracting which are more like U.S. DoD-type margins. And so while we will see kind of a net blended margin profile that's probably higher than the kind of base U.S. DoD, it will be limited - at least the incremental business is going to be limited because they are FMS."

These charts also include information regarding non-GAAP measures that may be used in today\u2019s call. Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I\u2019d begin today with a few key strategic and operational highlights and then Jay will discuss our quarterly financial results and full-year 2023 outlook. Starting on page 3 of this slide our Q2 financial results were strong, with sales of $16.7 billion up 8% year-over-year and double-digit growth at both aeronautics and space. Backlog reached a record level of $158 billion, up $8 billion from year-end resulting from a book-to-bill of $1.7 in the quarter. Orders included an approximately $8 billion option of [Indiscernible] for the 126 F-35 for production lot 17 as well as significant awards to ramp up emissions [Ph] at MSC. This highest ever backlog gives us visibility into multiyear sales of our key programs and enables our suppliers to be better positioned to meet growing demand. Segment operating profit of $1.9 million in the quarter reflected an operating margin of 11.1%. Free cash flow was $771 million and we remain committed to advancing technology and expanding production capacity. So in Q2, we invested $356 million of company funded R&D and $329 million of capital expenditures to address our customer\u2019s needs and requirements. Meanwhile, we returned almost two times free cash flow to the shareholders. Given the strong results in the first half of this year, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 financial outlook. For sales we\u2019re raising the midpoint of our range by $1 billion to revise expectation of between $66.25 billion to $66.75 billion and free EPS we are raising the midpoint of our range by $0.35, to revise the expectation of between $27 to $27.20 per share. We are confident in our ability to achieve these higher expectations and return to growth sooner than previously anticipated. Turning to the state of the defense budget, the outcome of the debt ceiling negotiations preserve top line defense spending at the President\u2019s budget request for FY 2024. It also stipulated defense budget growth in FY 2025 while allowing for additional support through supplemental funding. The Embedded 3% growth in the proposed FY 2024 defense budget included funding for 83 F-35 aircraft with supplemental funding to support munitions investment that will enable us to ramp up production rates under new multiyear contracting authorities. While there are still numerous steps to reach final approval and funding for the FY 2024 budget, we\u2019re encouraged by the strong support for our programs so far, and we look forward to the completion of committee reviews in the full appropriations process. On the F-35 program, we continue to see strengthening customer demand both domestically and internationally. The Czech Republic has expressed interest in the aircraft and Israel has formally decided to add 25 More F-35s, expanding their fleet by 50%. We delivered 50 F-35s in the first half of 2023, all of which were delivered and the technology refresh to or TR2 configuration. During the first quarter earnings call we indicated that in anticipated reduction to 2023 deliveries from what we initially thought last year, due to software maturation, acceptance and certification related to the Technology Refresh Three or TR3 configuration and hardware delivery timing. Our current view is we expected to deliver 100 to 120 F-35 aircraft in 2023. Importantly, there is no change to our longer term delivery outlook of 156 aircraft in 2025 in the foreseeable future, and the supply chain and production system continues to execute at a rate to support these future delivery targets. Our team remains fully dedicated to delivering the first TR3 aircraft in 2023. We have completed 58 flight tests on four different aircraft in the TR3 configuration, including a successful flight test for the most recent software release that happened in May. That software update brought in the next set of critical capabilities, such as upgraded data links, the new electro optical targeting system and radar. In the coming weeks and months, we will begin testing multi shift missions, sensor fusion, and additional weapons among other capabilities as part of the next software release. TR3 significantly updates core processing power and memory capacity, as well as modernizes the computational core of the F-35 to enable block four capabilities. It is a significant hardware and software upgrade that will greatly enhance the mission capability of the aircraft, which is on track to be the free world\u2019s predominant fighter for many decades into the future. Meanwhile, we are continuing the long tradition of leading the development of the next generation of military aviation in this time, with both piloted and unpiloted aircraft and our Skunk Works operation in California's high desert. Skunk Works just celebrated its 80th year anniversary in June. That\u2019s 80 years of pushing the innovation envelope from the year [Ph] to in the 1950s that continues to fly today to the Mach three plus SR-71 to pioneering stealth aircraft, and beyond by advancing hypersonic artificial intelligence and other revolutionary technologies. Skunk Works continues to create exciting feats of engineering and goes beyond the edge of known science for our customers. A prime example today that we can discuss is our partnership with NASA to develop and build the X-59, the prototype that will quiet the supersonic boom and lead someday perhaps to supersonic commercial flights over land. This elegant and amazing airplane is advancing a pace towards its first test flight. And our company\u2019s pioneering spirit has lived even longer in the world of rotorcraft and helicopters. At the Paris Air Show, Sikorsky celebrated its 100th anniversary. Yes, 100 years ago, Igor founded Sikorsky aero engineering company on a chicken farm in Long Island, New York, with a small team of engineers and craftsmen, many of whom were immigrants like himself, who fled the Russian Revolution. In 1939, he brought his dream to reality when he piloted the first practical helicopter, the VS-300 as it left the ground for all 10 seconds. His passion for innovation and perseverance to achieve his vision carry on in the Sikorsky culture today and throughout Lockheed Martin. Sikorsky signature product line the H-60 Black Hawk family of military helicopters, also perseveres around the world. The U.S. State Department is approved a possible foreign military sale to Norway for 6 MH-60 Romeo multimission, helicopters and related equipment and Spain signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 8 MH-60R Seahawk aircraft as well. We achieve several milestones in the quarter in support of other NATO allies as well. The German air force successfully launched a PAC-3 missiles segment enhancement or MSC interceptor from a German modified launcher. This flight test was the last step before delivering PAC-3 MSC to Germany later this year. We also entered into an agreement with Rheinmetall Defence to collaborate on a unique rocket artillery system to be produced in Germany. And earlier in July, Rheinmetall selected a site in Germany to build a factory to manufacture F-35A center fuselages. This partnership, which was first announced in February between Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Rheinmetall expand supply chain capacity for the F-35. Production is expected to start with our new German partner in 2025. In addition, our relationship with Poland continues to progress with the first F-35 Lightning II for the Polish Air Force formerly entering production and the initial shipment of HIMARS launchers to Poland. The U.S. State Department also approved the multibillion dollar potential foreign military sale to Poland for PAC-3 with modernized sensors and components. On top of that, our partnership with Australia continues to advance as well. In April, as mentioned on our last earnings call, the Commonwealth of Australia selected Lockheed Martin as a preferred bidder for Project 9102, a sovereign military satellite communication system for the Australian Defence Force, we\u2019re excited at the prospect of deepening our relationship with a diverse team of Australian companies and helping establish Victoria as the engineering and technical hub for Australian Defence. Also in space, Lockheed Martin will be taking on a major role in Blue Origin\u2019s national team to develop and demonstrate a human lunar landing system for the Artemis program. Our Space Operations will be building humanity\u2019s first Cislunar Transporter, which will enable recurring astronaut expeditions to the moon surface and back from NASA\u2019s gateway space station. Finally, we continue to advance our integrated 21st century security digital technology architecture during the quarter. In May, as part of the U.S. Indo Pacific commands joint fires network, we successfully demonstrated Digital Command Control or C-2 to synchronize joint all domain operations during the northern edge exercise near Alaska. The exercise demonstrated the ability to successfully integrate with both Lockheed Martin and third party platforms and aircraft, including F-35s. The system performed C-2 functions across all the military services, all levels of operation and across multiple domains from space to air to surface. This is the first time Joint Force synchronization has been demonstrated at this scale. It was a major milestone for all joint all domain command and control interoperability, and our company\u2019s vision for 21st century security. The results of this demonstration will help shape future JADC2 capabilities and continue Igor Sikorsky and Skunk Works pioneering legacy into the digital world. Also, as part of the northern edge exercise, the Lockheed Martin aeronautics and RMS teams demonstrated the first use of artificial intelligence capabilities on a stocker unmanned aircraft system for recognition and tracking of ships at sea. This capability showcase the value of using relatively cheap drones to greatly enhance the capability of and improve the survivability of much more valuable manned aircraft and ships. All these types of digital technology enhancements require reliable access to advanced semiconductors. In support of this crucial priority, I recently had the opportunity to join Global Foundries CEO Tom Caulfield and Senate Majority Leader Schumer to announce a collaboration that will advance us semiconductor manufacturing and strengthen resiliency within America supply chain. This partnership enables us to more quickly and affordably produce 21st century security technologies that increase deterrence for the United States and its allies, alongside Senator Schumer and other leaders and industry, Congress and the administration, we remain strongly supportive of the bipartisan chips and Science Act signed into law last year. The Lockheed Martin team will work closely with Global Foundries as we expand our critical manufacturing line in New York and with our semiconductor, other semiconductor and tech industry partners across the country to ensure access to made in America microelectronics for our platforms and systems. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions.\nJay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I\u2019ll walk you through our consolidated results and business area performance for the second quarter of 2023. I\u2019ll also provide an update to our full year guidance. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings released today. Beginning at chart 4, let\u2019s take a closer look at second quarter results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Second quarter sales increased 8% year-over-year driven by aeronautics and space, both with double digit growth in the quarter. This growth partly benefited from last year\u2019s $325 million impact from unrecognized F-35. sales. Excluding that benefit sales were up 6% year-over-year, with Arrow still up 12%. Segment operating profit was up 5% year-over-year, driven by the sales growth, which more than offset lower net favorable profit adjustments aligned to risk retirement timing. As expected, segment margins are 11.1%. Moving to earnings per share, on chart 5, on an adjusted basis, EPS was up 6.5% driven by higher profit and a lower share count partially offset by increased interest expense. Moving to cash flow on chart 6, we generated $771 million of free cash flow in the quarter with nearly $330 million of capital expenditures. On a year-over-year basis, our free cash flow included $330 million of higher tax payments from the R&D capitalization legislation. Once again, dividends and share repurchases exceeded free cash flow in the quarter, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. For the first half of 2023, we returned almost $2.8 billion or 137% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. In the quarter we issued $2 billion of debt across three tranches for a weighted coupon of 4.8%. We had intended to raise the debt early in 2024 to support share repurchases, but accelerated the issuance to give us flexibility in coverage going into the debt ceiling negotiations. Okay, let's turn over to moving to the segment results. And starting with aeronautics on chart 7, second quarter sales at Arrow increased $1 billion driven by higher volume on the F-35, C-130 and classified programs. On F-35 we saw strong year-over-year growth in production and sustainment with some of the favourability due to the previously mentioned impact in the second quarter of 2022 to the lot 15 to 17 funding timing. Excluding that benefit aeronautics was up 12%. Operating profit increased 17% over the prior year based on the higher sales. As Jim mentioned, we were pleased that the joint program office exercise the next option, Lot 17 on the F-35 contract in the quarter. F-35 backlog now stands at 421 aircraft at the end of the quarter and offers longer term clarity for our production operations and provide stability to our supply chain partners. Looking at missiles and fire control on page 8, sales were comparable to last year as higher sales volume on tactical strike missile programs were offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense. As expected, segment operating profit and margins were down year-over-year, driven by lower net profit adjustments. MFC increased the backlog by $6.5 billion in the second quarter reflecting a record $9 billion of orders in the quarter and a 3.3 book-to-bill ratio. The orders were increases were broad based across several of our key programs, including PAC-3, GMLRS. HIMARS, JASSM LRASM, and Javelin. At Rotary and Mission Systems on page 9, sales declined 3% in the quarter driven by lower volume on Black Hawk as the program continues to transition from multi-year nine to multi-year 10. This decline was partially offset by favorable volume across several radar programs within integrated warfare systems and sensors. Operating profit decreased slightly to the lower sales volume and net profit adjustments, partially offset by higher equity earnings. There were a few significant offsetting items that drove net profit adjustments down $40 million year-over-year. We recorded an unfavorable adjustment of $100 million in the Canadian maritime helicopter program, due to updated forecasts partially offset by a $65 million benefit on an International Airborne Surveillance Program. Turning to chart 10. In our space business area, sales were up 12% year-over-year, driven by continued development activity on a Next-Gen Interceptor and classified programs, with additional upside coming from Orion. Operating profit increased 15% and margins were up 30 basis points driven by the increased volume and higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance year-over-year. Now shifting to the outlook for 2023 on page 11. For the full year, we\u2019ve increased our sales segment operating profit and earnings per share outlook, while also tightening the ranges based on our strong year-to-date performance. At a consolidated levels, sales are up $1 billion at the midpoint to $66.5 billion, allowing us to return a growth in 2023 earlier than previously anticipated, and segment operating profit is up $45 million at the midpoint to $7.35 billion. At the business area level, we\u2019ve increased Arrow\u2019s outlook for sales by $250 million, with profit of $25 million based on higher volume on F-35, sustainment and classified work at Skunk Works. As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, we expect minimal impact to our cost throughput in 2023 as a result of the lower F-35 aircraft deliveries. And while we expect there to be some pressure on cash collections we are driving offset opportunities to make up any shortfalls. At space, we\u2019re raising the sales midpoint by $750 million on higher development volume and the profit midpoint by $20 million, as the benefit from higher sales is partially offset by a lower ULA earning earnings outlook. Lastly, we\u2019re maintaining our free cash flow guidance at or above $6.2 billion and remained committed to $4 billion of share repurchases with $2.7 billion in the back half of the year. We continue to expect that these repurchases along with dividends will generate a return more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. Looking at the 2023 earnings per share expectation changes on page 12 we\u2019ve increased the EPS midpoint by $0.35, with the largest portion $0.14 coming from improved business area profit. We expect $0.11 benefit from a lower share count and we also expect the $0.06 benefit from a lower tax rate to 15% of or about 20 basis points. The remaining $0.04 comes from mix of miscellaneous offsetting items. Finally on page 13, and to summarize and close out our comments. Our first half [Ph] results were strong driving our return to growth a year earlier than anticipated, and leading to the increased outlook for sales, profit and EPS. Our backlog gives us confidence in our expected growth acceleration in 2024 and beyond. In addition, we remain committed to reward shareholders through industry leading dividends, and robust share repurchases. And finally, we continue to focus on our strategic initiatives 21st century security and 1LMX in order to transform a business and extend our industry leadership, while delivering consistent and reliable shareholder returns. With that, Lois let\u2019s open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. [Operator Instructions] And that first question comes from Robert Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRobert Spingarn: Hi, good morning.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nRobert Spingarn: So, Jim and Jay, you both talked a bit about the strong backlog expansion at MFC and how that helps the second half of this year, perhaps a bit earlier than expected. I wanted to see if you could get into a little more color on how that drives 24 and beyond. And how sustainable this is? And then lastly, Jay, can the rising volumes on some of these legacy programs mitigate that margin pressure from the classified work at MFC?\nJay Malave: Sure, if you look at where we are, and maybe take us back to I think it was the fourth quarter call in January. I was asked about our outlook for 2024 growth and at the time, what I said was to expect a low single digit growth. And I think that that\u2019s just right now we\u2019re going to park there, although that\u2019ll be on a higher base here in 2023 because 2023 is better. But we still need to go through and get a feel for what the site supply chain performance clearly with the backlog? It's not a question of demand; it\u2019ll be a question of supply. And we need to go through that analysis over the next few months. And determine to what extent our growth outlook will change, if anything from this baseline of low single digit. And so if anything, what I would say the backlog gives us a lot of confidence that we are going to return to growth. The demand signal itself would indicate a higher rate than low single digit. But we need to wait and watch the supplies part of it to make sure that that can catch up to that demand. As far as the margin profile at MFC, we do expect there to be continued pressure over the next number of years. I would agree that some of the upside that we\u2019ve seen in this incremental demand are from higher margin products and should provide some level of mitigation, but we will really get a feel for exactly what that means until again, as we go through this over the next few months as we understand specifically, what type what contribution each of these different programs will have in 2024 and beyond and what their timing will be and what that mixed benefit may be.\nJim Taiclet: And Rob, I can give you some long-term context here. So first, from a process perspective with the U.S. government. There\u2019s multiyear procurement authority now for a whole set of sort of Lockheed Martin products, and I\u2019ll just run through them really quick. It\u2019s joint air ground missile, HIMARS, ATACMS, which is a longer range GMLRS for the HIMARS. PAC-3 MSC, the GMLRS itself, which is the you, get the HIMARS primary munition, Javelin, and LRASM and JASSM. So all of those programs have multiyear procurement authorities. And so far the GMLRS PAC-3 LRASM and JASSM are in pursuit of multiyear contracts with us currently already. And then, if you look at the corpus, the Ukraine supplemental, and what they\u2019re targeted for, the overall amount has been $62 billion in four bills, the DoD regarding the Ukraine support, about two thirds of that or 44 billion is for the purpose of restoring the Presidential drawdown, for the train to security assistance initiative, essentially meaning the restocking of U.S. munitions. Now a lot of those munitions are going to be upgraded from what was in the stockpile, to the capability that we can produce today. So that\u2019s another motivation for the U.S. to go through with that. And we\u2019ve kind of derived at about 7 billion of those funds can be allocated at some of that Lockheed Martin programs that I just talked about. So there are significant long-term upside opportunities for our MFC business. And as Jay said, they\u2019re fairly high margin and there\u2019s increasing international demand for a lot of those products too. So I think it\u2019s a really good long-term foundation for growth for the company.\nRobert Spingarn: Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Akers: Yes. Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to follow up on the commentary on Tech Refresh 3. Can you just touch on the cash impact of that? How big was that, how were you able to offset that and kind of hold this year\u2019s guidance? And then I guess is it fair to assume sort of additional deliveries above the 150 level for 2024 and sort of cash and benefits associated with that next year?\nJim Taiclet: Yes Matt so the impact on a per aircraft basis, around $7 million per aircraft. So if you go to, when we came into the year we were expecting between our range was 147 to 153. So you go for the midpoint there off for 150. 30 aircraft would be a $210 million impact and all the way down to 100 would be 50, about 350. So you\u2019re talking between 200 and $350 million impact to this year. As I mentioned, we\u2019re diligently working to manage that and offset it with tailwinds elsewhere in the portfolio. And to your point, to the extent that that does slip into next year, it\u2019s really a matter of timing. So yes, it would as we deliver aircraft, to for those who slip into next year will recover those remaining payments that are upon acceptance of the aircraft in 2024.\nJay Malave: Yes, and just as a kind of to, again put it all in context, we can actually deliver more than 156 aircraft in 2024, because the factory is going to be producing at the rate of 156. So there\u2019s some carryover, we might actually deliver more in 2024, then what the on-going run rate will be because the factory will still be performing, right while those aircraft are waiting to be accepted. I just want to make sure that everybody knows what we\u2019re applying to this problem to make sure that we minimize it. And this is the same conversation that I\u2019m having with the senior seniors in military and civilian roles in government. So first of all, we are not suppliers are applying all the needed resources to this, it\u2019s a top priority for our company and few others as well. We\u2019re running extra shifts, and we\u2019re deploying subject matter experts into other companies or suppliers, operations to make sure this stays on track, flight test programs on schedule. And we\u2019ve got the sufficient pilots, both in the company and in the Department of Defense, for acceptance, as we move forward on all of that. And then finally, the purpose of the flight test program is to base continuously narrow the funnel of testing of all the aircraft functions and mission capabilities in a really methodical fashion sort of narrowing a funnel. And so we\u2019re just moving through that and methodical way. Our latest estimate is that\u2019ll all be completed by the end of the fourth quarter this year. Could it move a little bit into early 2024? Yes, it could. But we think we\u2019re on track to really get all the dimensions of resources, commitment, and schedule to give that option for the December delivery everything we can.\nMatthew Akers: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Yes, good morning, Jim and Jay. Hey Jay, thanks for all the color on the F-35. I was wondering just regarding like when we think about all the backlog growth you have now you\u2019ve got a pretty big step up in CapEx this year, mid-teens growth? How are we thinking about just kind of supporting the backlog? Are you expecting kind of the CapEx profile to kind of level off here? Or are you expect that to increase and maybe also related to how you\u2019re thinking about working capital in the same context? Thanks.\nJay Malave: Yes, on CapEx, I would definitely expect it to increase in the back half of the year. We\u2019re still holding our forecast of $1.95 billion for the year. And we\u2019re going to that\u2019s going to essentially stay elevated for the next few years. So a lot of that is investment in capacity and production capability, as Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks. And so we expect that to return kind of remained fairly level. On the working capital side, that for us is a is a source of opportunity. We expect that to really to what we\u2019re trying to do is take it back down to what we performed, from a day\u2019s perspective over the past, say 2020 2021, and some period of 2022. And so, while we\u2019re increasing volumes, you would expect working capital to increase as well. We believe there\u2019s efficiency opportunities to perform at levels we\u2019ve been able to perform in the past and make that at a minimum, not a use of cash. And if we\u2019re fully successful, make it a source of cash in spite of growth. And so that\u2019s our view, particularly the back half of the year as well as over the next few years.\nPeter Arment: Appreciate that. Thanks Jay.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question is from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Jim and Jay. Thank you. So maybe just some space given it drove your guidance raise. You know what drove the improved outlook, you called out 700 million of higher revenues related to development in space. Can you just give us a little bit of color there was that competitive win or any more detail on what was driving that?\nJay Malave: Yes, it\u2019s just in many cases Sheila it\u2019s earlier than anticipated ramps on some of the programs. So the first half, we ran higher than we expected. And we were expecting to run at those levels in the back half of the year. This includes classified programs, also protected communications, international security space business, as well as an NGINS [Ph] in our strategic and missile defense business within space. We\u2019ve also had a little bit of growth in the Next Gen OPIR Program. And so all of those together, really drove the increase versus where we were coming into the year. And much of that we\u2019ve really realized in the first half of the year with a little bit to come in the back half, but we had already planned ramping up those programs in the back half.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, great. Thank you.\nJay Malave: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Rich Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nRichard Safran: Jim, Jay, Maria. Good morning. So there\u2019s been a lot of press around the F-35. And an engine upgrade both during and after Paris. I just want to know if you could clarify your remarks a bit discuss where you stand on the new engine program. But also, I\u2019d like to know what this kind of means for Lockheed and for the F-35. In general, since the engine as I thought was government furnished equipment.\nJim Taiclet: You\u2019re absolutely right, Rich. This is Jim here. It\u2019s government first equipments, a decision of the U.S. government as to what engine is selected for every block of aircraft and what modernization program goes along with that engine. So Lockheed Martin\u2019s role and responsibility in this is simply to receive the engine performance data from the manufacturers, and their anticipated performance improvements, whether it\u2019s a modernization or replacement option for the future. And then we translate that data to aircraft performance data and information that we then supply to our U.S. government customers. And then we are available to answer questions for their decision making process. So we\u2019re not involved in that decision making process. And therefore, Lockheed Martin does not have a formal company position on engine selection or modernization. We implement that this U.S. government decision. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing now. So that is very clearly our role and responsibility. And anything outside of that is not an official company position.\nRichard Safran: Thanks. Got it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hi, good morning, everyone.\nJay Malave: Morning.\nNoah Poponak: Jay. We\u2019ve talked about this dynamic where the outlays have lagged the authorization. In the second quarter, outlays finally grew a decent amount, your revenue then grew at the fastest rate in a while organically year-over-year. I know in the back half, you have tougher comps. But the updated guidance and the revenue would have to be down in the back half organically. So I guess I\u2019m curious to hear you talk about is the outlay to authorization gap going to keep closing, is supply chain or whatever else was impacting that resolved? And are you building guidance assuming that continues to close? Or would that create upside if it were to play out that way?\nJay Malave: We think no, the outlays will continue to increase it is just a function of us, we always have a back half is still higher than the first half. And that\u2019s still the case here. When you look at our overall sales in the back half sequentially versus the first half, it\u2019s about a billion dollars higher. And a lot of that is in aeronautics is going to be driving that. And so I would expect the outlays to continue to increase on an absolute basis over that period of time. The compares, it\u2019s a function where our this year sales are more level loaded than they were last year. So we yes, we are having will have a step up and sales. But it won\u2019t be as significant as it was a year later, or sorry, to last year. And part of that is if you recall last year, we had the $325 million in the second quarter that slipped into the third quarter in 2022. We also had a late award on the F-35 program that we weren\u2019t anticipating in the fourth quarter. We were expecting that in the first quarter. And we\u2019re able to convert pre contract inventory to sales immediately in the quarter. And so when you combine those that in of itself last year was about $500 million So when you normalize those for those things on much of a memorial level load here in 2023 versus 2022, it drives you to this. The compare just is going to be more difficult because on a year-over-year basis last year in the fourth quarter, partly for these reasons, we had 7% growth in the fourth quarter. So we won\u2019t see that we will see the back half of the year organically declined, relative to the from a year-over-year perspective, but again, still putting us in a position to deliver growth a year earlier than we expected. It\u2019s also just a function of our program timing. Yes, it\u2019s still higher, but just we\u2019re just not at the at the ramp up rate that we had in 2022.\nNoah Poponak: Got it. And Jay pension on the cash flow statement, I think it\u2019s been a bit since you\u2019ve updated the beyond 2023 contribution and cash recovery. Could you give us updated numbers for that?\nJay Malave: Sure. For cash for cash contributions, we\u2019re right now we\u2019re anticipating that we would have a required cash contribution in 2025, anywhere between $500 million to $1 billion. As I noted earlier in the call, our objective is to really offset that really through three things. More net income, cash base net income and contribution. We\u2019re going to see a tailwind in terms of dissipation of the R&D capitalization headwinds that we\u2019ve seen. And it will also be driving working capital performance to a higher productivity level. So we can offset that our goal over this period of time is to continue to deliver a low single digit free cash flow growth on an absolute basis. And that combined with our share repurchase program, should result in a mid-single digit free cash flow per share growth. So that\u2019s our objective, not over the next few years, really over a longer period of time as well. But that\u2019s really where we stand right now on pension contributions, and how we\u2019re planning for it.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Back in April, the DoD said the center fuselage production was the limiter to higher production on the F-35 above 156 per year. So with Rheinmetall, excuse me, now it\u2019s signed up for fuselage is starting in 2025. Can you talk about the upside towards the end of the decade above the 156 level as Rheinmetall steps up to maybe 10% capacity?\nJay Malave: Well, that\u2019s one important element miles of being able to expand past 156. But there are a lot of other elements that would have to be essentially funded between our suppliers, ourselves and the U.S. government to build the rate in the entire supply chain above the 156 level that we\u2019ve all agreed on so far with the government. So if the demand continues for the aircraft, which it seems to be re-joining [Ph] continuously, and the U.S. authorizes export of the aircraft to either more countries or more in more in more numbers to existing countries, there might be a business case for the government and industry to go beyond the 156. The Rheinmetall center fuselage expansion will definitely be constructive to that, let\u2019s say.\nMyles Walton: And just a clarification, despite the lower deliveries, you haven\u2019t slowed the production system on the F-35 on this TR3 issue, correct?\nJay Malave: No, we haven\u2019t. So the whole production system, especially the long lead time parts, are tracking through the supply chain, as if we\u2019re, going on our ramp up of between, 100, mean 140s, and ultimately to 156. The deliveries will be that of their delays, if there are delays of aircraft will be fully completed aircraft on the ramp waiting for not just not even the software load. But the confirmation that the software load they have for TR3 passed all the flight test points. And that\u2019s really what they\u2019ll be caught waiting for. There won\u2019t be a production lag. There\u2019ll be just a delivery lag based on the completion of the software integration testing that has to be done in the air on not only on the aircraft, but among numerous aircraft flying together at the same time. That\u2019s they\u2019ll be waiting for.\nMyles Walton: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKen Herbert: Yes, hi, good morning, Jim and Jay. A two part question, if I could on the back hog. Is there any well, can you first help us understand how much of the backlog growth is maybe directly Ukraine related and is there any risk to this based on either sort of timing of the war or funding ultimately, going to allied partners and put in place for the obviously for the restocking. And then as part of the long-term agreement, you have in place on munitions and around a lot of this, how should we think about the potential margin positive margin impact from these longer term agreements?\nJay Malave: Let me Ken go to the with the backlog, much of the backlog particularly here, what we saw in the second quarter, were 20%, only 23 contracting requirements. There was something there was also GMLRS, which, which also included some 24 requirements. But, as Jim mentioned, we\u2019re working towards multiyear contracting, but are not yet under any multiyear contracting agreements yet. And so, what we put into the backlog is pretty high confidence, it\u2019s going to convert to sales. And so we\u2019re continue to do it. As Jim mentioned, having a dialogue with a customer to the dry multiyear requirements beyond that. As far as the marginal in terms of long-term agreements, we essentially, many cases will enter into agreements with our supply chain, with over that period of time of these requirements, so we\u2019ll go back to back with our customer. So as we enter into agreements with our customer, that will cover multi years, we will also get into contracts with our suppliers for those same multi year. So any benefits that we get from that probably is going to drop through to our customer in favorable terms and pricing. So I wouldn\u2019t expect there to be any type of margin upside from where we are today. So I would expect consistent margins from those. But again, those are pretty solid.\nKen Herbert: Great, thanks, Jay.\nJay Malave: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Jason Gursky from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJason Gursky: Good morning, everybody. Jay, Jim, give you an opportunity to maybe offer up some comments on the other segments. Jay you\u2019ve talked a little bit about low single digits, expectation and MFC. I mean if you could walk us through the other segments as we move out into 2024 and beyond and kind of your baseline assumptions for those at this point. And then also, maybe talk a little bit about margins, you made some comments during the quarter about the 1LMX initiative that you have going on, particularly around supply chain, and consolidating your purchasing and maybe getting some better purchasing power and pricing, and just kind of how that's informing your outlook for margins in the future.\nJay Malave: Okay, so just start with the growth rates and 24 and beyond. Just to make sure, I was clear, when I said low single digit, I meant for the entire company, total consolidated sales. MFC should be significantly better than that. And we would expect them to be our highest growth segment. And I\u2019ll go from there. The others will see some growth from the remainders, but really, the driver will be MFC over the next few years, given this demand, incremental demand that we\u2019ve seen. On 1LMX, on the margins, we\u2019ve been, this is a initiative for us, which is very significant, it\u2019s more than an ERP upgrade. It\u2019s our engineering tools, product lifecycle tools, it\u2019s our manufacturing execution system tools, it\u2019s our customer relationship management tools, our HR system tools, and it\u2019s intended to make or make us a more competitive company. Many of those benefits that we\u2019re going to obtain, we will pass those through in pricing and our forward pricing rates to our customer. And so we won\u2019t necessarily see some more our margin benefit from it. But it will make us more competitive to capture more business and stay in front of the industry and maintain our leadership. And so that\u2019s the way we\u2019re approaching 1LMX and a really more of a financial view of it.\nJason Gursky: So fair to say then, that margin outcomes will depend largely on mix going forward between development work and fixed.\nJay Malave: Yes, that\u2019s I would say that\u2019s, that\u2019s accurate. The mix will definitely be a factor in, in future margins.\nJason Gursky: Okay, thanks.\nJay Malave: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from David Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Thanks, good morning.\nJay Malave: Good morning, David.\nDavid Strauss: Once we get an update on your position on section 174, see if anything\u2019s changed there, based on feedback you might have gotten from any of the tax authorities. And then the second one, Aerojet Lockheed L-3s potential acquisition there of Aerojet I think recently you\u2019ve been out to with some comments around just reviewing whether LHX has been able to or where they are in terms of being able to satisfy your concerns around that deal. Thanks.\nJay Malave: Sure. I\u2019ll take the sections 174 question. In over the past, I\u2019d say probably six months, the IRS has acknowledged that this is an issue they need to provide guidance to, we\u2019re hopeful that we\u2019ll see some guidance by the end of the year from them related to our position, there\u2019s been no change in our position there. And so, what we eagerly await any type of guidance that they may have and still feel confident in the position that we\u2019ve taken. And I\u2019ve laid out in the past of why we\u2019ve taken our position that we have today. There has been some legislation proposed that could defer the implementation of section 174 to 2026, it would be retroactive to 2022. So we\u2019ve we\u2019re optimistic, of course, we believe that it should be repealed. But at least a deferral would be a good start. And so we'll monitor that legislation. Obviously, we\u2019re supportive of that. And we\u2019ll see how it works through Congress. And then when it comes to Aerojet Rocketdyne, we have two interests and only two. And those are the reliable access to propulsion, especially solid rocket motors is critical of critical importance to the entire aerospace and defense industry. And so the two sided benefit that we need to preserve of Aerojet Rocketdyne\u2019s current structure is that it\u2019s a merchant supplier of propulsion to the industry. And that means it treats all of the -- I\u2019ll call them prime contractors for the end products, the OEMs equally. And that\u2019s what we feel we need to preserve, even if AJRD goes into the ownership hands of another company. Secondly, the performance of AJRD has been improving, but it needs to get significantly better nonetheless. And so whether it\u2019s on its own or part of another company, it\u2019s really important that resources be applied to AJRD\u2019s operations, so that it becomes a more capable supplier for on time, deliveries, quality, etcetera. So those are our two interests, maintaining the merchant supplier status, and also having higher performance of the operations of that company. So we have not received any commitments from L3Harris at this time, that would assure us that they are going to keep AJRD as a merchant supplier. And that\u2019s the one thing we really are looking for.\nDavid Strauss: Right, thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.\nJay Malave: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nRonald Epstein: Yes, hey, good morning guys. Maybe a broader big picture question here. As we as we look out to the fiscal 2024 budget, and what so what was in fiscal 2023? And the trajectory, maybe even, fiscal 2025. And 2024, it looks like there's going to be maybe 6 billion or so of spending on classified aircraft programs, everything from NGAD, F/A-XX. Now there\u2019s been chatter about replacing U-2 with the hypersonic platform. I know you\u2019re limited in what you can say, but can you just give us a feel for what kind of what that means for Lockheed Martin? How you think about it? And as outsiders kind of model this and think about it, how would you guide us to think about it?\nJim Taiclet: Well, I\u2019d start with there Ron is that, we\u2019re got and our experiencing significant growth in our classified portfolio already. It\u2019s a bright spot for the company. I think recently, we\u2019ve been when we aggregate all of our classified programs together sort of a 7% growth rate. So it is a place where because of Skunk Works, our space operations, some segments of RMS and MSC even where we have significant talent and capability to work in those kinds of really advanced spaces. I\u2019d basically said in the prepared remarks, there are areas of this company where we are endeavoring to move into areas beyond known science to address what our customers kind of challenges are that they are facing. And so we have the capability to take advantage of a larger classified program growth rate on the part of government spending if that\u2019s what happens. So we\u2019re in good shape to do that. There are missions that you need to differentiate though when it comes to aircraft, right. There\u2019s the reconnaissance and surveillance mission, right, which can a lot of it can be done with unmanned system. And that\u2019s one of the strengths of Skunk Works for example. So that mission we have a real strength in unmanned surveillance ISR systems are called. Then you\u2019ve got the air superiority type of aircraft, right? So you can think about F-15, for example, F-22. NGAD is the next generation air dominance aircraft that is classified. It\u2019s the Air Force recently said that there is competition. Now beginning for that are in train for that air dominance aircraft that it was very old aircraft. And then there\u2019s the kind of all-purpose strike aircraft, right, so that's F-16, F-35. Those kind of airplanes, again, where we have the advantage in F-35 is volume, right. We\u2019ve got the committed volume for the strike mission. And basically all three variants, right, so it\u2019s Air Force, which is a land base, long runway solution, it\u2019s for the Marines, which is the B model, which is a land base, short runway, so a solution [Indiscernible] take-off and landing or carrier take-off or landing solution. And then you\u2019ve got the C-model, which is the pure Navy, big carrier, tail hook type of landing aircraft. So the capacity for the strike mission, can and will be pursued through the F-35 and large part for the near future. So those are the ways to think about aircraft. So the classified programs are going to be largely in air superiority and ISR for the most part, and then there\u2019s the bomber mission, which is largely going to be carried out by the B-21 Going forward. So hopefully, that\u2019s a bit helpful to your question there.\nJay Malave: And just running. Overall, the over the entire portfolio, the classified business for us is around $8 billion. And if you recall, we talked about it being one of the four pillars of our growth projection all the way through 2027. And our highest probably will be our programs of record, given what we\u2019ve seen, particularly with MFC. But that will be our second highest grow or anywhere between mid to high single digit growth through 2027.\nRonald Epstein: Got it? All right. Thank you.\nJay Malave: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.\nPete Skibitski: Yes, good morning. Can you can you just talk about labor availability and cost, just incrementally from last quarter. Has hiring become easier, just in terms of hiring people? And then also wage rates? Have you seen improvement there? Thanks.\nJim Taiclet: Yes, so we\u2019ve actually, over the past six months, our labor availability has improved significantly. We have closed a lot of our key critical skill gaps over this period of time. And that partly has enabled the sales growth, the incremental sales growth that we\u2019ve seen here in our change outlook, because part of that is just our own internal labor. And so we\u2019re in a much better position than we were even six months ago. We\u2019ve seen some lower attrition rates, as well as better hiring rates as well. And so we\u2019re fairly confident that that will stick and that also bodes well for the rest of the industry, particularly supply chain. So we\u2019re encouraged by that.\nPete Skibitski: Okay, that\u2019s great. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you. If I want to go back to missiles and fire control in Ukraine for a minute, because if we think back to the early days of the Russia, Ukraine conflict, there were things like Javelin for you there was of course, stingers, everything looks like it would be kind of a short term need, potentially building out some capacity for replenishment of weapons. And so now we are more than a year later into this. And you\u2019ve gotten some very big awards in this last quarter, that appear to be related to Ukraine, either directly or other European needs. We\u2019re seeing NATO spending go up. Can you talk about how you view the opportunity and missiles and fire control for revenue and, and backlog? I had, depending on how things may play out in Ukraine, from if we saw, the conflict come to a resolution or if we had increasing NATO involvement, how do you think about that in your planning?\nJim Taiclet: So I would say qualitatively and maybe turn it over to Jay for some quantification around it is that the tragedy of Ukraine has unveiled some issues and weaknesses for our national defense enterprise more broadly, right. And so I\u2019m not convinced Doug that the duration of the Ukraine war which we hope is very short, will affect our long-term prospects for MFC. But the lessons from this conflict will, will remain for many years. And that\u2019s what I think is most important. And the lessons are that great power conflict, first and foremost, unfortunately, is not gone from the world at this point in history. Russia\u2019s decision to invoke a major power land war on the European continent was pretty risky, and demonstrates that they may take other risks in the future to mate, sustain its regime or to expand its power, whatever the case, and the motivation may be. So NATO then, and when you talk to the defense ministers of countries like Poland and Lithuania, they are taking this extremely seriously, not for the short term, but for the long term. And so they are expanding their defense budgets not because of what\u2019s going on necessarily in the on the ground in Ukraine right now. It\u2019s for the elevated risks that they perceive to their own countries for some foreseeable future. Sadly, when it comes to the United States, the lesson, among others of this situation in Ukraine, unfortunately, is the expenditure rates of munitions is much higher than most of our existing war gaming models would imply. And therefore, there\u2019s a replenishment need for what\u2019s been used and what\u2019s been shipped to Ukraine. But beyond that, is the planning and hopefully, deterrence of future conflicts where the U.S. and its allies are going to need to, first of all demonstrate to a potential adversary that they have the stockpiles, to defend themselves for a long period of time if need be. And that the rates of munitions usage will be supportable from their stockpiles and from their industry. So we think this is a longer term, essentially, sea change in national defense strategy for the U.S. and for our Western allies, including Japan and the Philippines and others. So we hope the conflict in Ukraine ends quickly. But the lessons and the future demand for these kinds of products is going to stay elevated for a very long time, we think.\nJay Malave: And that appears consistent with the nature of these recent orders you\u2019ve gotten that are large quantities extend over work over a longer period of time than we might have thought.\nDouglas Harned: Right.\nMaria Ricciardone Lee: This is Maria. I think we\u2019ve come to the top of the hour here. So I\u2019ll turn it back to Jim for some final thoughts.\nJim Taiclet: Just a couple of things. I wanted to make sure everybody understands that we\u2019re up to what I now think is a great start after three years of launching our 21st century security, concept and strategy. It was really originally around include proving and increasing deterrence to conflict by accelerating the adoption of digital technologies like 5G, distributed cloud, AI, international defense. And I think we\u2019re making huge progress on that. We\u2019ve got a great set of partnerships with tech companies large and small to help us do that, and the customer starting to adopt it. And as I talked about the repair to prepared remarks, remarks, we\u2019re showing the major exercises, and we\u2019re getting some actual revenue and Program Awards around that. But we\u2019re going to expand that concept into two arenas based on this experiences we\u2019ve had in the last two or three years. The first one is to build and strengthen the defense production supply chain based on some of the things you just talked about. We\u2019re going to have to have a more resilient defense production system and one that can scale quickly if we have to. And then the other dimension is to make international production and sustainment operations a part of at least Lockheed Martin\u2019s future. And you see, you hear us talk about investments in Australia, the U.K., potentially, Poland, Germany is new in this for us. So we\u2019re going to continue to expand internationally to make sure we have resilient supply chain, and we have sustainment operations where our customers can use them to deter future conflict around the world. So those are some of the things I think is really important for you all to understand where we\u2019re headed. But before concluding the call, I really would like to thank all my Lockheed Martin teammates, for their many important contributions to strengthening our national security and increasing deterrence. And the strong financial and operational performance that we\u2019ve been experiencing in this quarter was a result of their dedication, hard work and look, whether it\u2019s on the factory floor or classified engineering facility or customer flight line our people showed up every day during the pandemic to do the job and they continue to show up every day to do the job to provide for national security. So I want to thank them and also thank you all for joining us on our call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next call in October. Lois, that concludes the call.\nOperator: Thank you and ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I'd begin today with a few key strategic and operational highlights and then Jay will discuss our quarterly financial results and full-year 2023 outlook. Starting on page 3 of this slide our Q2 financial results were strong, with sales of $16.7 billion up 8% year-over-year and double-digit growth at both aeronautics and space. Backlog reached a record level of $158 billion, up $8 billion from year-end resulting from a book-to-bill of $1.7 in the quarter. Orders included an approximately $8 billion option of [Indiscernible] for the 126 F-35 for production lot 17 as well as significant awards to ramp up emissions [Ph] at MSC. This highest ever backlog gives us visibility into multiyear sales of our key programs and enables our suppliers to be better positioned to meet growing demand. Segment operating profit of $1.9 million in the quarter reflected an operating margin of 11.1%. Free cash flow was $771 million and we remain committed to advancing technology and expanding production capacity. So in Q2, we invested $356 million of company funded R&D and $329 million of capital expenditures to address our customer's needs and requirements. Meanwhile, we returned almost two times free cash flow to the shareholders. Given the strong results in the first half of this year, we are raising and narrowing our full year 2023 financial outlook. For sales we're raising the midpoint of our range by $1 billion to revise expectation of between $66.25 billion to $66.75 billion and free EPS we are raising the midpoint of our range by $0.35, to revise the expectation of between $27 to $27.20 per share. We are confident in our ability to achieve these higher expectations and return to growth sooner than previously anticipated. Turning to the state of the defense budget, the outcome of the debt ceiling negotiations preserve top line defense spending at the President's budget request for FY 2024. It also stipulated defense budget growth in FY 2025 while allowing for additional support through supplemental funding. The Embedded 3% growth in the proposed FY 2024 defense budget included funding for 83 F-35 aircraft with supplemental funding to support munitions investment that will enable us to ramp up production rates under new multiyear contracting authorities. While there are still numerous steps to reach final approval and funding for the FY 2024 budget, we're encouraged by the strong support for our programs so far, and we look forward to the completion of committee reviews in the full appropriations process. On the F-35 program, we continue to see strengthening customer demand both domestically and internationally. The Czech Republic has expressed interest in the aircraft and Israel has formally decided to add 25 More F-35s, expanding their fleet by 50%. We delivered 50 F-35s in the first half of 2023, all of which were delivered and the technology refresh to or TR2 configuration. During the first quarter earnings call we indicated that in anticipated reduction to 2023 deliveries from what we initially thought last year, due to software maturation, acceptance and certification related to the Technology Refresh Three or TR3 configuration and hardware delivery timing. Our current view is we expected to deliver 100 to 120 F-35 aircraft in 2023. Importantly, there is no change to our longer term delivery outlook of 156 aircraft in 2025 in the foreseeable future, and the supply chain and production system continues to execute at a rate to support these future delivery targets. Our team remains fully dedicated to delivering the first TR3 aircraft in 2023. We have completed 58 flight tests on four different aircraft in the TR3 configuration, including a successful flight test for the most recent software release that happened in May. That software update brought in the next set of critical capabilities, such as upgraded data links, the new electro optical targeting system and radar. In the coming weeks and months, we will begin testing multi shift missions, sensor fusion, and additional weapons among other capabilities as part of the next software release. TR3 significantly updates core processing power and memory capacity, as well as modernizes the computational core of the F-35 to enable block four capabilities. It is a significant hardware and software upgrade that will greatly enhance the mission capability of the aircraft, which is on track to be the free world's predominant fighter for many decades into the future. Meanwhile, we are continuing the long tradition of leading the development of the next generation of military aviation in this time, with both piloted and unpiloted aircraft and our Skunk Works operation in California's high desert. Skunk Works just celebrated its 80th year anniversary in June. That's 80 years of pushing the innovation envelope from the year [Ph] to in the 1950s that continues to fly today to the Mach three plus SR-71 to pioneering stealth aircraft, and beyond by advancing hypersonic artificial intelligence and other revolutionary technologies. Skunk Works continues to create exciting feats of engineering and goes beyond the edge of known science for our customers. A prime example today that we can discuss is our partnership with NASA to develop and build the X-59, the prototype that will quiet the supersonic boom and lead someday perhaps to supersonic commercial flights over land. This elegant and amazing airplane is advancing a pace towards its first test flight. And our company's pioneering spirit has lived even longer in the world of rotorcraft and helicopters. At the Paris Air Show, Sikorsky celebrated its 100th anniversary. Yes, 100 years ago, Igor founded Sikorsky aero engineering company on a chicken farm in Long Island, New York, with a small team of engineers and craftsmen, many of whom were immigrants like himself, who fled the Russian Revolution. In 1939, he brought his dream to reality when he piloted the first practical helicopter, the VS-300 as it left the ground for all 10 seconds. His passion for innovation and perseverance to achieve his vision carry on in the Sikorsky culture today and throughout Lockheed Martin. Sikorsky signature product line the H-60 Black Hawk family of military helicopters, also perseveres around the world. The U.S. State Department is approved a possible foreign military sale to Norway for 6 MH-60 Romeo multimission, helicopters and related equipment and Spain signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 8 MH-60R Seahawk aircraft as well. We achieve several milestones in the quarter in support of other NATO allies as well. The German air force successfully launched a PAC-3 missiles segment enhancement or MSC interceptor from a German modified launcher. This flight test was the last step before delivering PAC-3 MSC to Germany later this year. We also entered into an agreement with Rheinmetall Defence to collaborate on a unique rocket artillery system to be produced in Germany. And earlier in July, Rheinmetall selected a site in Germany to build a factory to manufacture F-35A center fuselages. This partnership, which was first announced in February between Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Rheinmetall expand supply chain capacity for the F-35. Production is expected to start with our new German partner in 2025. In addition, our relationship with Poland continues to progress with the first F-35 Lightning II for the Polish Air Force formerly entering production and the initial shipment of HIMARS launchers to Poland. The U.S. State Department also approved the multibillion dollar potential foreign military sale to Poland for PAC-3 with modernized sensors and components. On top of that, our partnership with Australia continues to advance as well. In April, as mentioned on our last earnings call, the Commonwealth of Australia selected Lockheed Martin as a preferred bidder for Project 9102, a sovereign military satellite communication system for the Australian Defence Force, we're excited at the prospect of deepening our relationship with a diverse team of Australian companies and helping establish Victoria as the engineering and technical hub for Australian Defence. Also in space, Lockheed Martin will be taking on a major role in Blue Origin's national team to develop and demonstrate a human lunar landing system for the Artemis program. Our Space Operations will be building humanity's first Cislunar Transporter, which will enable recurring astronaut expeditions to the moon surface and back from NASA's gateway space station. Finally, we continue to advance our integrated 21st century security digital technology architecture during the quarter. In May, as part of the U.S. Indo Pacific commands joint fires network, we successfully demonstrated Digital Command Control or C-2 to synchronize joint all domain operations during the northern edge exercise near Alaska. The exercise demonstrated the ability to successfully integrate with both Lockheed Martin and third party platforms and aircraft, including F-35s. The system performed C-2 functions across all the military services, all levels of operation and across multiple domains from space to air to surface. This is the first time Joint Force synchronization has been demonstrated at this scale. It was a major milestone for all joint all domain command and control interoperability, and our company's vision for 21st century security. The results of this demonstration will help shape future JADC2 capabilities and continue Igor Sikorsky and Skunk Works pioneering legacy into the digital world. Also, as part of the northern edge exercise, the Lockheed Martin aeronautics and RMS teams demonstrated the first use of artificial intelligence capabilities on a stocker unmanned aircraft system for recognition and tracking of ships at sea. This capability showcase the value of using relatively cheap drones to greatly enhance the capability of and improve the survivability of much more valuable manned aircraft and ships. All these types of digital technology enhancements require reliable access to advanced semiconductors. In support of this crucial priority, I recently had the opportunity to join Global Foundries CEO Tom Caulfield and Senate Majority Leader Schumer to announce a collaboration that will advance us semiconductor manufacturing and strengthen resiliency within America supply chain. This partnership enables us to more quickly and affordably produce 21st century security technologies that increase deterrence for the United States and its allies, alongside Senator Schumer and other leaders and industry, Congress and the administration, we remain strongly supportive of the bipartisan chips and Science Act signed into law last year. The Lockheed Martin team will work closely with Global Foundries as we expand our critical manufacturing line in New York and with our semiconductor, other semiconductor and tech industry partners across the country to ensure access to made in America microelectronics for our platforms and systems. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions. Good morning. And Rob, I can give you some long-term context here. So first, from a process perspective with the U.S. government. There's multiyear procurement authority now for a whole set of sort of Lockheed Martin products, and I'll just run through them really quick. It's joint air ground missile, HIMARS, ATACMS, which is a longer range GMLRS for the HIMARS. PAC-3 MSC, the GMLRS itself, which is the you, get the HIMARS primary munition, Javelin, and LRASM and JASSM. So all of those programs have multiyear procurement authorities. And so far the GMLRS PAC-3 LRASM and JASSM are in pursuit of multiyear contracts with us currently already. And then, if you look at the corpus, the Ukraine supplemental, and what they're targeted for, the overall amount has been $62 billion in four bills, the DoD regarding the Ukraine support, about two thirds of that or 44 billion is for the purpose of restoring the Presidential drawdown, for the train to security assistance initiative, essentially meaning the restocking of U.S. munitions. Now a lot of those munitions are going to be upgraded from what was in the stockpile, to the capability that we can produce today. So that's another motivation for the U.S. to go through with that. And we've kind of derived at about 7 billion of those funds can be allocated at some of that Lockheed Martin programs that I just talked about. So there are significant long-term upside opportunities for our MFC business. And as Jay said, they're fairly high margin and there's increasing international demand for a lot of those products too. So I think it's a really good long-term foundation for growth for the company. Yes Matt so the impact on a per aircraft basis, around $7 million per aircraft. So if you go to, when we came into the year we were expecting between our range was 147 to 153. So you go for the midpoint there off for 150. 30 aircraft would be a $210 million impact and all the way down to 100 would be 50, about 350. So you're talking between 200 and $350 million impact to this year. As I mentioned, we're diligently working to manage that and offset it with tailwinds elsewhere in the portfolio. And to your point, to the extent that that does slip into next year, it's really a matter of timing. So yes, it would as we deliver aircraft, to for those who slip into next year will recover those remaining payments that are upon acceptance of the aircraft in 2024. You're absolutely right, Rich. This is Jim here. It's government first equipments, a decision of the U.S. government as to what engine is selected for every block of aircraft and what modernization program goes along with that engine. So Lockheed Martin's role and responsibility in this is simply to receive the engine performance data from the manufacturers, and their anticipated performance improvements, whether it's a modernization or replacement option for the future. And then we translate that data to aircraft performance data and information that we then supply to our U.S. government customers. And then we are available to answer questions for their decision making process. So we're not involved in that decision making process. And therefore, Lockheed Martin does not have a formal company position on engine selection or modernization. We implement that this U.S. government decision. And that's what we're doing now. So that is very clearly our role and responsibility. And anything outside of that is not an official company position. Well, I'd start with there Ron is that, we're got and our experiencing significant growth in our classified portfolio already. It's a bright spot for the company. I think recently, we've been when we aggregate all of our classified programs together sort of a 7% growth rate. So it is a place where because of Skunk Works, our space operations, some segments of RMS and MSC even where we have significant talent and capability to work in those kinds of really advanced spaces. I'd basically said in the prepared remarks, there are areas of this company where we are endeavoring to move into areas beyond known science to address what our customers kind of challenges are that they are facing. And so we have the capability to take advantage of a larger classified program growth rate on the part of government spending if that's what happens. So we're in good shape to do that. There are missions that you need to differentiate though when it comes to aircraft, right. There's the reconnaissance and surveillance mission, right, which can a lot of it can be done with unmanned system. And that's one of the strengths of Skunk Works for example. So that mission we have a real strength in unmanned surveillance ISR systems are called. Then you've got the air superiority type of aircraft, right? So you can think about F-15, for example, F-22. NGAD is the next generation air dominance aircraft that is classified. It's the Air Force recently said that there is competition. Now beginning for that are in train for that air dominance aircraft that it was very old aircraft. And then there's the kind of all-purpose strike aircraft, right, so that's F-16, F-35. Those kind of airplanes, again, where we have the advantage in F-35 is volume, right. We've got the committed volume for the strike mission. And basically all three variants, right, so it's Air Force, which is a land base, long runway solution, it's for the Marines, which is the B model, which is a land base, short runway, so a solution [Indiscernible] take-off and landing or carrier take-off or landing solution. And then you've got the C-model, which is the pure Navy, big carrier, tail hook type of landing aircraft. So the capacity for the strike mission, can and will be pursued through the F-35 and large part for the near future. So those are the ways to think about aircraft. So the classified programs are going to be largely in air superiority and ISR for the most part, and then there's the bomber mission, which is largely going to be carried out by the B-21 Going forward. So hopefully, that's a bit helpful to your question there. Yes, so we've actually, over the past six months, our labor availability has improved significantly. We have closed a lot of our key critical skill gaps over this period of time. And that partly has enabled the sales growth, the incremental sales growth that we've seen here in our change outlook, because part of that is just our own internal labor. And so we're in a much better position than we were even six months ago. We've seen some lower attrition rates, as well as better hiring rates as well. And so we're fairly confident that that will stick and that also bodes well for the rest of the industry, particularly supply chain. So we're encouraged by that. So I would say qualitatively and maybe turn it over to Jay for some quantification around it is that the tragedy of Ukraine has unveiled some issues and weaknesses for our national defense enterprise more broadly, right. And so I'm not convinced Doug that the duration of the Ukraine war which we hope is very short, will affect our long-term prospects for MFC. But the lessons from this conflict will, will remain for many years. And that's what I think is most important. And the lessons are that great power conflict, first and foremost, unfortunately, is not gone from the world at this point in history. Russia's decision to invoke a major power land war on the European continent was pretty risky, and demonstrates that they may take other risks in the future to mate, sustain its regime or to expand its power, whatever the case, and the motivation may be. So NATO then, and when you talk to the defense ministers of countries like Poland and Lithuania, they are taking this extremely seriously, not for the short term, but for the long term. And so they are expanding their defense budgets not because of what's going on necessarily in the on the ground in Ukraine right now. It's for the elevated risks that they perceive to their own countries for some foreseeable future. Sadly, when it comes to the United States, the lesson, among others of this situation in Ukraine, unfortunately, is the expenditure rates of munitions is much higher than most of our existing war gaming models would imply. And therefore, there's a replenishment need for what's been used and what's been shipped to Ukraine. But beyond that, is the planning and hopefully, deterrence of future conflicts where the U.S. and its allies are going to need to, first of all demonstrate to a potential adversary that they have the stockpiles, to defend themselves for a long period of time if need be. And that the rates of munitions usage will be supportable from their stockpiles and from their industry. So we think this is a longer term, essentially, sea change in national defense strategy for the U.S. and for our Western allies, including Japan and the Philippines and others. So we hope the conflict in Ukraine ends quickly. But the lessons and the future demand for these kinds of products is going to stay elevated for a very long time, we think. Just a couple of things. I wanted to make sure everybody understands that we're up to what I now think is a great start after three years of launching our 21st century security, concept and strategy. It was really originally around include proving and increasing deterrence to conflict by accelerating the adoption of digital technologies like 5G, distributed cloud, AI, international defense. And I think we're making huge progress on that. We've got a great set of partnerships with tech companies large and small to help us do that, and the customer starting to adopt it. And as I talked about the repair to prepared remarks, remarks, we're showing the major exercises, and we're getting some actual revenue and Program Awards around that. But we're going to expand that concept into two arenas based on this experiences we've had in the last two or three years. The first one is to build and strengthen the defense production supply chain based on some of the things you just talked about. We're going to have to have a more resilient defense production system and one that can scale quickly if we have to. And then the other dimension is to make international production and sustainment operations a part of at least Lockheed Martin's future. And you see, you hear us talk about investments in Australia, the U.K., potentially, Poland, Germany is new in this for us. So we're going to continue to expand internationally to make sure we have resilient supply chain, and we have sustainment operations where our customers can use them to deter future conflict around the world. So those are some of the things I think is really important for you all to understand where we're headed. But before concluding the call, I really would like to thank all my Lockheed Martin teammates, for their many important contributions to strengthening our national security and increasing deterrence. And the strong financial and operational performance that we've been experiencing in this quarter was a result of their dedication, hard work and look, whether it's on the factory floor or classified engineering facility or customer flight line our people showed up every day during the pandemic to do the job and they continue to show up every day to do the job to provide for national security. So I want to thank them and also thank you all for joining us on our call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next call in October. Lois, that concludes the call."

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll walk you through our consolidated results and business area performance for the second quarter of 2023. I'll also provide an update to our full year guidance. As I describe our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings released today. Beginning at chart 4, let's take a closer look at second quarter results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit. Second quarter sales increased 8% year-over-year driven by aeronautics and space, both with double digit growth in the quarter. This growth partly benefited from last year's $325 million impact from unrecognized F-35. sales. Excluding that benefit sales were up 6% year-over-year, with Arrow still up 12%. Segment operating profit was up 5% year-over-year, driven by the sales growth, which more than offset lower net favorable profit adjustments aligned to risk retirement timing. As expected, segment margins are 11.1%. Moving to earnings per share, on chart 5, on an adjusted basis, EPS was up 6.5% driven by higher profit and a lower share count partially offset by increased interest expense. Moving to cash flow on chart 6, we generated $771 million of free cash flow in the quarter with nearly $330 million of capital expenditures. On a year-over-year basis, our free cash flow included $330 million of higher tax payments from the R&D capitalization legislation. Once again, dividends and share repurchases exceeded free cash flow in the quarter, demonstrating our commitment to shareholder returns. For the first half of 2023, we returned almost $2.8 billion or 137% of free cash flow through dividends and share repurchases. In the quarter we issued $2 billion of debt across three tranches for a weighted coupon of 4.8%. We had intended to raise the debt early in 2024 to support share repurchases, but accelerated the issuance to give us flexibility in coverage going into the debt ceiling negotiations. Okay, let's turn over to moving to the segment results. And starting with aeronautics on chart 7, second quarter sales at Arrow increased $1 billion driven by higher volume on the F-35, C-130 and classified programs. On F-35 we saw strong year-over-year growth in production and sustainment with some of the favourability due to the previously mentioned impact in the second quarter of 2022 to the lot 15 to 17 funding timing. Excluding that benefit aeronautics was up 12%. Operating profit increased 17% over the prior year based on the higher sales. As Jim mentioned, we were pleased that the joint program office exercise the next option, Lot 17 on the F-35 contract in the quarter. F-35 backlog now stands at 421 aircraft at the end of the quarter and offers longer term clarity for our production operations and provide stability to our supply chain partners. Looking at missiles and fire control on page 8, sales were comparable to last year as higher sales volume on tactical strike missile programs were offset by lower volume within integrated air and missile defense. As expected, segment operating profit and margins were down year-over-year, driven by lower net profit adjustments. MFC increased the backlog by $6.5 billion in the second quarter reflecting a record $9 billion of orders in the quarter and a 3.3 book-to-bill ratio. The orders were increases were broad based across several of our key programs, including PAC-3, GMLRS. HIMARS, JASSM LRASM, and Javelin. At Rotary and Mission Systems on page 9, sales declined 3% in the quarter driven by lower volume on Black Hawk as the program continues to transition from multi-year nine to multi-year 10. This decline was partially offset by favorable volume across several radar programs within integrated warfare systems and sensors. Operating profit decreased slightly to the lower sales volume and net profit adjustments, partially offset by higher equity earnings. There were a few significant offsetting items that drove net profit adjustments down $40 million year-over-year. We recorded an unfavorable adjustment of $100 million in the Canadian maritime helicopter program, due to updated forecasts partially offset by a $65 million benefit on an International Airborne Surveillance Program. Turning to chart 10. In our space business area, sales were up 12% year-over-year, driven by continued development activity on a Next-Gen Interceptor and classified programs, with additional upside coming from Orion. Operating profit increased 15% and margins were up 30 basis points driven by the increased volume and higher equity earnings from United Launch Alliance year-over-year. Now shifting to the outlook for 2023 on page 11. For the full year, we've increased our sales segment operating profit and earnings per share outlook, while also tightening the ranges based on our strong year-to-date performance. At a consolidated levels, sales are up $1 billion at the midpoint to $66.5 billion, allowing us to return a growth in 2023 earlier than previously anticipated, and segment operating profit is up $45 million at the midpoint to $7.35 billion. At the business area level, we've increased Arrow's outlook for sales by $250 million, with profit of $25 million based on higher volume on F-35, sustainment and classified work at Skunk Works. As we've mentioned previously, we expect minimal impact to our cost throughput in 2023 as a result of the lower F-35 aircraft deliveries. And while we expect there to be some pressure on cash collections we are driving offset opportunities to make up any shortfalls. At space, we're raising the sales midpoint by $750 million on higher development volume and the profit midpoint by $20 million, as the benefit from higher sales is partially offset by a lower ULA earning earnings outlook. Lastly, we're maintaining our free cash flow guidance at or above $6.2 billion and remained committed to $4 billion of share repurchases with $2.7 billion in the back half of the year. We continue to expect that these repurchases along with dividends will generate a return more than 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders for the year. Looking at the 2023 earnings per share expectation changes on page 12 we've increased the EPS midpoint by $0.35, with the largest portion $0.14 coming from improved business area profit. We expect $0.11 benefit from a lower share count and we also expect the $0.06 benefit from a lower tax rate to 15% of or about 20 basis points. The remaining $0.04 comes from mix of miscellaneous offsetting items. Finally on page 13, and to summarize and close out our comments. Our first half [Ph] results were strong driving our return to growth a year earlier than anticipated, and leading to the increased outlook for sales, profit and EPS. Our backlog gives us confidence in our expected growth acceleration in 2024 and beyond. In addition, we remain committed to reward shareholders through industry leading dividends, and robust share repurchases. And finally, we continue to focus on our strategic initiatives 21st century security and 1LMX in order to transform a business and extend our industry leadership, while delivering consistent and reliable shareholder returns. With that, Lois let's open up the call for Q&A. Sure, if you look at where we are, and maybe take us back to I think it was the fourth quarter call in January. I was asked about our outlook for 2024 growth and at the time, what I said was to expect a low single digit growth. And I think that that's just right now we're going to park there, although that'll be on a higher base here in 2023 because 2023 is better. But we still need to go through and get a feel for what the site supply chain performance clearly with the backlog? It's not a question of demand; it'll be a question of supply. And we need to go through that analysis over the next few months. And determine to what extent our growth outlook will change, if anything from this baseline of low single digit. And so if anything, what I would say the backlog gives us a lot of confidence that we are going to return to growth. The demand signal itself would indicate a higher rate than low single digit. But we need to wait and watch the supplies part of it to make sure that that can catch up to that demand. As far as the margin profile at MFC, we do expect there to be continued pressure over the next number of years. I would agree that some of the upside that we've seen in this incremental demand are from higher margin products and should provide some level of mitigation, but we will really get a feel for exactly what that means until again, as we go through this over the next few months as we understand specifically, what type what contribution each of these different programs will have in 2024 and beyond and what their timing will be and what that mixed benefit may be. Yes, and just as a kind of to, again put it all in context, we can actually deliver more than 156 aircraft in 2024, because the factory is going to be producing at the rate of 156. So there's some carryover, we might actually deliver more in 2024, then what the on-going run rate will be because the factory will still be performing, right while those aircraft are waiting to be accepted. I just want to make sure that everybody knows what we're applying to this problem to make sure that we minimize it. And this is the same conversation that I'm having with the senior seniors in military and civilian roles in government. So first of all, we are not suppliers are applying all the needed resources to this, it's a top priority for our company and few others as well. We're running extra shifts, and we're deploying subject matter experts into other companies or suppliers, operations to make sure this stays on track, flight test programs on schedule. And we've got the sufficient pilots, both in the company and in the Department of Defense, for acceptance, as we move forward on all of that. And then finally, the purpose of the flight test program is to base continuously narrow the funnel of testing of all the aircraft functions and mission capabilities in a really methodical fashion sort of narrowing a funnel. And so we're just moving through that and methodical way. Our latest estimate is that'll all be completed by the end of the fourth quarter this year. Could it move a little bit into early 2024? Yes, it could. But we think we're on track to really get all the dimensions of resources, commitment, and schedule to give that option for the December delivery everything we can. Yes, on CapEx, I would definitely expect it to increase in the back half of the year. We're still holding our forecast of $1.95 billion for the year. And we're going to that's going to essentially stay elevated for the next few years. So a lot of that is investment in capacity and production capability, as Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks. And so we expect that to return kind of remained fairly level. On the working capital side, that for us is a is a source of opportunity. We expect that to really to what we're trying to do is take it back down to what we performed, from a day's perspective over the past, say 2020 2021, and some period of 2022. And so, while we're increasing volumes, you would expect working capital to increase as well. We believe there's efficiency opportunities to perform at levels we've been able to perform in the past and make that at a minimum, not a use of cash. And if we're fully successful, make it a source of cash in spite of growth. And so that's our view, particularly the back half of the year as well as over the next few years. Yes, it's just in many cases Sheila it's earlier than anticipated ramps on some of the programs. So the first half, we ran higher than we expected. And we were expecting to run at those levels in the back half of the year. This includes classified programs, also protected communications, international security space business, as well as an NGINS [Ph] in our strategic and missile defense business within space. We've also had a little bit of growth in the Next Gen OPIR Program. And so all of those together, really drove the increase versus where we were coming into the year. And much of that we've really realized in the first half of the year with a little bit to come in the back half, but we had already planned ramping up those programs in the back half. You're welcome. Morning. We think no, the outlays will continue to increase it is just a function of us, we always have a back half is still higher than the first half. And that's still the case here. When you look at our overall sales in the back half sequentially versus the first half, it's about a billion dollars higher. And a lot of that is in aeronautics is going to be driving that. And so I would expect the outlays to continue to increase on an absolute basis over that period of time. The compares, it's a function where our this year sales are more level loaded than they were last year. So we yes, we are having will have a step up and sales. But it won't be as significant as it was a year later, or sorry, to last year. And part of that is if you recall last year, we had the $325 million in the second quarter that slipped into the third quarter in 2022. We also had a late award on the F-35 program that we weren't anticipating in the fourth quarter. We were expecting that in the first quarter. And we're able to convert pre contract inventory to sales immediately in the quarter. And so when you combine those that in of itself last year was about $500 million So when you normalize those for those things on much of a memorial level load here in 2023 versus 2022, it drives you to this. The compare just is going to be more difficult because on a year-over-year basis last year in the fourth quarter, partly for these reasons, we had 7% growth in the fourth quarter. So we won't see that we will see the back half of the year organically declined, relative to the from a year-over-year perspective, but again, still putting us in a position to deliver growth a year earlier than we expected. It's also just a function of our program timing. Yes, it's still higher, but just we're just not at the at the ramp up rate that we had in 2022. Sure. For cash for cash contributions, we're right now we're anticipating that we would have a required cash contribution in 2025, anywhere between $500 million to $1 billion. As I noted earlier in the call, our objective is to really offset that really through three things. More net income, cash base net income and contribution. We're going to see a tailwind in terms of dissipation of the R&D capitalization headwinds that we've seen. And it will also be driving working capital performance to a higher productivity level. So we can offset that our goal over this period of time is to continue to deliver a low single digit free cash flow growth on an absolute basis. And that combined with our share repurchase program, should result in a mid-single digit free cash flow per share growth. So that's our objective, not over the next few years, really over a longer period of time as well. But that's really where we stand right now on pension contributions, and how we're planning for it. Well, that's one important element miles of being able to expand past 156. But there are a lot of other elements that would have to be essentially funded between our suppliers, ourselves and the U.S. government to build the rate in the entire supply chain above the 156 level that we've all agreed on so far with the government. So if the demand continues for the aircraft, which it seems to be re-joining [Ph] continuously, and the U.S. authorizes export of the aircraft to either more countries or more in more in more numbers to existing countries, there might be a business case for the government and industry to go beyond the 156. The Rheinmetall center fuselage expansion will definitely be constructive to that, let's say. No, we haven't. So the whole production system, especially the long lead time parts, are tracking through the supply chain, as if we're, going on our ramp up of between, 100, mean 140s, and ultimately to 156. The deliveries will be that of their delays, if there are delays of aircraft will be fully completed aircraft on the ramp waiting for not just not even the software load. But the confirmation that the software load they have for TR3 passed all the flight test points. And that's really what they'll be caught waiting for. There won't be a production lag. There'll be just a delivery lag based on the completion of the software integration testing that has to be done in the air on not only on the aircraft, but among numerous aircraft flying together at the same time. That's they'll be waiting for. Let me Ken go to the with the backlog, much of the backlog particularly here, what we saw in the second quarter, were 20%, only 23 contracting requirements. There was something there was also GMLRS, which, which also included some 24 requirements. But, as Jim mentioned, we're working towards multiyear contracting, but are not yet under any multiyear contracting agreements yet. And so, what we put into the backlog is pretty high confidence, it's going to convert to sales. And so we're continue to do it. As Jim mentioned, having a dialogue with a customer to the dry multiyear requirements beyond that. As far as the marginal in terms of long-term agreements, we essentially, many cases will enter into agreements with our supply chain, with over that period of time of these requirements, so we'll go back to back with our customer. So as we enter into agreements with our customer, that will cover multi years, we will also get into contracts with our suppliers for those same multi year. So any benefits that we get from that probably is going to drop through to our customer in favorable terms and pricing. So I wouldn't expect there to be any type of margin upside from where we are today. So I would expect consistent margins from those. But again, those are pretty solid. Thank you. Okay, so just start with the growth rates and 24 and beyond. Just to make sure, I was clear, when I said low single digit, I meant for the entire company, total consolidated sales. MFC should be significantly better than that. And we would expect them to be our highest growth segment. And I'll go from there. The others will see some growth from the remainders, but really, the driver will be MFC over the next few years, given this demand, incremental demand that we've seen. On 1LMX, on the margins, we've been, this is a initiative for us, which is very significant, it's more than an ERP upgrade. It's our engineering tools, product lifecycle tools, it's our manufacturing execution system tools, it's our customer relationship management tools, our HR system tools, and it's intended to make or make us a more competitive company. Many of those benefits that we're going to obtain, we will pass those through in pricing and our forward pricing rates to our customer. And so we won't necessarily see some more our margin benefit from it. But it will make us more competitive to capture more business and stay in front of the industry and maintain our leadership. And so that's the way we're approaching 1LMX and a really more of a financial view of it. Yes, that's I would say that's, that's accurate. The mix will definitely be a factor in, in future margins. Thank you. Good morning, David. Sure. I'll take the sections 174 question. In over the past, I'd say probably six months, the IRS has acknowledged that this is an issue they need to provide guidance to, we're hopeful that we'll see some guidance by the end of the year from them related to our position, there's been no change in our position there. And so, what we eagerly await any type of guidance that they may have and still feel confident in the position that we've taken. And I've laid out in the past of why we've taken our position that we have today. There has been some legislation proposed that could defer the implementation of section 174 to 2026, it would be retroactive to 2022. So we've we're optimistic, of course, we believe that it should be repealed. But at least a deferral would be a good start. And so we'll monitor that legislation. Obviously, we're supportive of that. And we'll see how it works through Congress. And then when it comes to Aerojet Rocketdyne, we have two interests and only two. And those are the reliable access to propulsion, especially solid rocket motors is critical of critical importance to the entire aerospace and defense industry. And so the two sided benefit that we need to preserve of Aerojet Rocketdyne's current structure is that it's a merchant supplier of propulsion to the industry. And that means it treats all of the -- I'll call them prime contractors for the end products, the OEMs equally. And that's what we feel we need to preserve, even if AJRD goes into the ownership hands of another company. Secondly, the performance of AJRD has been improving, but it needs to get significantly better nonetheless. And so whether it's on its own or part of another company, it's really important that resources be applied to AJRD's operations, so that it becomes a more capable supplier for on time, deliveries, quality, etcetera. So those are our two interests, maintaining the merchant supplier status, and also having higher performance of the operations of that company. So we have not received any commitments from L3Harris at this time, that would assure us that they are going to keep AJRD as a merchant supplier. And that's the one thing we really are looking for. You're welcome. And just running. Overall, the over the entire portfolio, the classified business for us is around $8 billion. And if you recall, we talked about it being one of the four pillars of our growth projection all the way through 2027. And our highest probably will be our programs of record, given what we've seen, particularly with MFC. But that will be our second highest grow or anywhere between mid to high single digit growth through 2027. You're welcome. And that appears consistent with the nature of these recent orders you've gotten that are large quantities extend over work over a longer period of time than we might have thought."

We had a solid start to the year with first quarter sales of $15.1 billion led by 16% year-over-year growth at space. Segment operating margin was 11.1% led by MFC at 15.8%. Free cash flow grew 11% to $1.3 billion and combined with the lower share count contributed to a strong free cash flow for share growth year-over-year. We remain on track to meet our financial expectations for the full-year and the return to growth in 2024 as we laid out in January. In terms of capital deployment, we returned $1.3 billion or 101% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the quarter. We remain focused on our long-term strategy of growing free cash flow per share and continue to plan to deliver approximately 110% of our free cash flow to stockholders in 2023 through dividends and buybacks. Turning to the budget. The administration released preliminary details of the FY \u201824 President's Budget Request or PBR in early March. This budget proposal reflects a heightened emphasis on defense and security cooperation with allies. The FY \u201824 DoD budget request is $842 billion an increase of $25 billion or 3% over the FY \u201823 enacted funding. The near peer threats posed by China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine is driving the national defense strategy and has created added demand for Lockheed Martin's advanced effective solutions. Key highlights include the procurement of 83 F-35 aircraft continued expansion in classified programs and an increase in requested funding for munitions. The PBR also includes facilitation investment and advanced funding for long lead time parts in support of multi-year procurement of JASSM and LRASM. We're also engaged with DoD on multi-year procurement proposals for PAC-3 MSE and guided multiple launch rocket systems. These proposals are subject to congressional approval during course of the FY \u201924 defense authorization and appropriations process. The PBR also includes continued investments in key technology development efforts such as conventional prompt strike, long range Hypersonic weapon, next generation interceptor, Hypersonic defense, bomb defense system and other space programs. Furthermore, key technology areas aligned with Lockheed Martin investment priorities received increased funding to include microelectronics, 5G technologies and joint all domain operations. We are encouraged by this initial request and look forward to its progression through the authorization and appropriations process. We also anticipate heightened emphasis on national security prioritization from Congress, supplemental spending requests including Ukraine and elevated demand from allies and partners. Turning to the F-35 program, the 83 F-35 Lightning II aircraft included in the PBR signaled strong support from the services and the administration. Moreover, the Canadian government's January announcement that it will procure 88 F-35s marks another milestone in continued international demand for the aircraft. As to production, deliveries of F-35 engines which are government furnished equipment resumed in February. And then flight operations and deliveries resumed in March. However, we do expect a fraction of total expected 2023 deliveries to be impacted later this year, due to both software maturation related to Technology Refresh 3 or TR3 and hardware delivery timing. However, we anticipate little to no revenue impact from any potential delivery delay and therefore no material adverse effect on our 2023 P&L. Jay will provide some more color on this in a moment. Also at Aeronautics, the first Greenville built F-16 Block 70 took flight and was delivered to Bahrain. In addition to the Bahrain customer six countries have selected Block 70 or 72 aircraft and Jordan and Bulgaria have signed letters of agreement for additional jets. Further related to the F-16 in the quarter, while I was at the U.S.-India CEO form in March, I had the privilege to announce the memorandum of understanding with the Tata Lockheed Martin Aero Structure Limited joint venture to produce F-16 wing structures in India demonstrating our commitment to India as an industry partner and customer, while bolstering our supply chain. Turning to Hypersonics, it is encouraging to see the continued investment outlined in the PBR for the conventional prompt strike weapon system or CPS. As it begins integration and testing for Zumwalt Class Ships recognizing our advancements in this critical technology. In February, the U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Martin an initial contract for CPS, the first sea based hypersonic strike capability for the United States. Enabling long range missile flight at speeds greater than Mach 5. First delivery is expected by the mid-2020s. Regarding our Air launch rapid response weapon also known as Aero, we are continuing testing of the system at hypersonic speeds in order to advance technical maturation of the missile and the glide body and to ensure the final product is safe, reliable and supportive of our customers' missions and future plans. In January, we also completed the second flight test of hypersonic air breathing weapons concept also known as Hawk in partnership with DARPA and the Air Force Research Lab. We accomplished all the test objectives during the second flight test, including affordable rapid development and performance requirements. And in late March, the U.S. Navy announced its support of the hypersonic air launched offensive anti surface strike weapon or HALO. Lockheed Martin was down selected and awarded a contract for the first step to fielding a critical capability over the next decade and begin the design and development of a carrier based air breathing hypersonic strike capability for the Navy's fleet. As a company, we remain fully committed to developing hypersonic technology on accelerated timelines to meet this critical national security need and establish a solid deterrent posture in this area for the U.S. and its allies. The hypersonic solutions are just one element in our vision of 21st Century security. We advanced several additional aspects of this strategy during the quarter, including announcing a memorandum of understanding with Juniper Networks to jointly develop integrated hybrid software defined wide area network solutions and to demonstrate that with our customers in the future. This technology enables Mission Aware Dynamic Routing, a foundational capability for resilient joint all domain operations. This mission where dynamic routing shifts the movement of data and communications in real time across a mix of military and commercial infrastructure according to evolving conditions. Our solutions give customers the flexibility to rapidly adapt to maintain the flow of crucial data and information as their assets operate in contested environments. We also led simulations of technologies to the U.S. Army, Air Force and Navy to demonstrate the impacts of 5G communications and advanced analytics to significantly improve operations and maintenance performance for a variety of aircraft, as well as for unmanned platforms and operationally challenging environments. And at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, I had the opportunity to deliver a keynote address and meet with CEOs across the digital technology, mobile and networking industries to encourage us working together to promote innovative solutions to protect our countries and advance our space exploration capabilities. Another example of our leadership in accelerating advanced 21st Century technologies to improve national defense and deterrence to conflict is in the arena of directed energy. Recently, our RMS unit achieved success in our initial test of our demos. High energy laser, which verifies that the laser's optical performance meets the system's targeted design parameters. This 50 kilowatt class laser weapon system aligns with the Army's directed energy, short range air defense mission. In addition to delivering on absolutely cutting edge technologies, demand for many of our well-known and long-time high performing systems continues to be strong. For example, in January, the Australian government announced the purchase of 20 Lockheed Martin high mobility artillery rocket systems or the now familiar High Mars, providing Australian defense force with a reliable, well proven capability. And we continue to grow our significant partnership with Australia beyond High Mars. In February, an agreement was announced between the Australian and United States governments for a foreign military sale of 40 UH-60M Black Hawks for the Australian Army and deliveries are slated to begin early this year. The Black Hawk remains unmatched as an all-around, multi role durable military helicopter for Australia and for the 34 other countries around the globe that use it. Further, we're excited to work with the ADF and Australian industry to develop their sovereign satellite communications component, otherwise known there as joint Project 9102. The Commonwealth of Australia announced in April that Lockheed Martin was selected as the preferred bidder for JP-9102. This multibillion dollar project will provide the ADF with a robust solution for military satellite communications and defined by its versatility and its resilience. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions.\nJay Malave: Thanks Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated and business area results for the first quarter and cover our 2023 outlook. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart three and an overview of consolidated financial results. Overall, 2023 is off to a solid start, positioning us well to meet our commitments for the year. We delivered just over $15 billion in sales with $1.7 billion in segment operating profit, resulting in 11.1% segment operating margin. Earnings per share was $6.61 and we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, enabling a solid shareholder return to share repurchases, and dividends. Our book-to-bill ratio for the first quarter was 0.7 as anticipated. With backlog expected to increase in the second quarter, from the upcoming order for F-35 Lot 17 production. And we continue to strategically invest in our growth strategy with $600 million of capital expenditures and independent research and development this quarter. These financial results are on track with our expectations for the year. Taking a closer look at the quarter's results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit on chart four, first quarter sales increased year-over-year by 1% as space led the way with 16% growth. Segment operating profit was down 2% as lower ULA equity earnings and contract mix more than offset the benefits from slightly higher volume and step ups. As expected, margins contracted mostly due to the lower equity earnings from ULA. Moving to earnings per share on chart five. GAAP earnings per share were up $0.17 or 3% over 2022. Adjusted for mark-to-market investment gains, EPS was flat. On an adjusted basis, the unfavorable year-over-year impacts from segment operating profit, interest expense and FAS/CAS pension income were offset by the lower share count. Moving to cash flow on chart six, we generated nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, including nearly $300 million of capital expenditures, as well as over $600 million of accelerated payments and continued support of the supply chain. Our cash deployment plan is on track, which we expect to accelerate throughout the year. In the quarter, we had $500 million of share repurchases and paid almost $800 million in quarterly dividends. Total cash return to shareholders in the quarter was 101% of free cash flow. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on chart seven. First quarter sales at Aero decreased 2% year-over-year. Lower F-35 production sales were partially offset by higher F-16 and classified program volumes. Operating profit was slightly lower than prior year as the impact from lower net profit adjustments and sales volume was partially offset by favorable contract mix. For the year, we expect F-35 deliveries to be lower than previously anticipated due to software maturation with the Tech Refresh 3 program and hardware delivery timing. We will refine the impact as the year progresses, but do not expect the change to Aero\u2019s 2023 sales and profit ranges that we had previously communicated in January as we maintain our production cost throughput profile for the year. Looking at Missiles and Fire Control on page eight, sales decreased 3% as lower sales volume on sensors and global sustainment, as well as our tactical strike missile programs were partially offset by growth in integrated air and missile defense. Segment operating profit was down 2%, driven by lower sales volumes and net profit adjustments, partially offset by favorable contract mix. At Rotary and Mission Systems on page nine, sales were down 1% from 2022, driven by lower volume on Black Hawk production and our C6 ISR programs. These declines were partially offset by favorable volume on radar programs and integrated warfare systems and sensors. Including Defense of Guam, an important growth area for RMS that was won in 2022. Operating profit decreased 14%, due to lower sales volume and timing of net profit adjustments. Turning to chart 10 and our space business area. Sales were up 16% in the quarter driven by strong growth on the next gen interceptor and classified programs and further boosted by favorable program lifecycle timing on Orion, protective communications, and fleet ballistic missile programs. Operating profit was up 13%, driven by the increase in volume and favorable profit adjustments partially offset by the lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Okay. Now shifting to the outlook for 2023 on page 11. For the year, we are reaffirming guidance for all key metrics. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $65 billion to $66 billion with segment operating margin at 11.2% at the midpoint. We also still expect to deliver free cash flow at or above $6.2 billion, while repurchasing $4 billion of outstanding shares. We believe our first quarter results position us to achieve these expectations as we continue to add orders, we program execution commitments and pursue new opportunities throughout the year. Right, so let's close on page 12 to summarize with the comments. As noted, first quarter represents a solid start to 2023. We reaffirm key financial metrics as previously guided and continue to expect a return to growth in 2024 and beyond. With consistent free cash flow per share growth. Looking ahead, our strategic focus on 21st Century Security Solutions aligns with expected increases to defense and security spending. With our continued discipline and focus on execution, we are on track to meet our expectations for long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders. With that Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Seth, I'm sorry Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Hey, thanks very much. Good morning, everyone, I apologize and I'm losing my voice a little bit here. But Jay, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the GAO report would indicate that Sikorsky\u2019s bid for FLRAA was about 45% of that of Bell? And so it seems like investors are, kind of, fortunate that Sikorsky did not win that competition. And I guess what can you say to investors, you talked about some of the classified missile profitability headwinds, I know there was a charge on CH-53K, some ULA development that, kind of, the bid process is consistent with generating adequate returns on new work?\nJay Malave: Great question, Seth. Let me just say on FLRAA. We're obviously disappointed. We believe that our offering was the best technology to support the multi-mission requirements at the best value. And while we'll acknowledge that the proposal did include aggressive pricing, a significant amount of our offering included efficiencies made possible by the benefits of 1LMX. And our adoption of 1LMX model-based and digital thread enhancements significantly improved our cost competitiveness and we expect that to continue in the future. The business case itself was favorable and that's what enabled the pricing that we were able to offer. As it relates to -- I think generally speaking, that's how we evaluate these proposals. We look at the NPV, we look at IRR, we looked at all different metrics, we look at current affordability. And as I mentioned at your conference Seth, I've said it, in a classified program at MFC, we have to take a little bit of short-term pain for some long-term gain. But the fact of the matter is the business case does provide that long-term gain for us. And so, we go through all of that as part of the management decision making, the technology that we can provide. As you would expect, we have the leverage, we have the capability of wherewithal to provide favorable pricing in outstanding technology offerings to our customer, and we don't do it at the expense of financial returns. Let me just add, just on the CH-53K, we did have something in the press release. There was a small adjustment related to a development contract -- an older development contract, there was no adjustments taken on the forward production agreements that we're working on currently.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Kristine Liwag with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Thanks, good morning, Jim and Jay. On the F-35, the talk of the performance-based logistics deal has been ongoing for some time. But it seems like it's possible you would reach a deal this year? So, could you give us an update in terms of where you stand in transitioning over to a PBL contract in the program? And then assuming that PBL meets conditions set by the 2022 NDAA, how could this impact the sustainment work and the overall program profile over the coming years?\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Kristine. It's an excellent question. We did estimate a proposal, we are expecting that to be decided by the end of the year and awarded. And we think this is the best solution for the customer, not only over the next five years, but frankly, over the -- this is the right program for the life of the program. And what this offers is really a win-win type of solution. It enables us to utilize our proprietary modeling for material requirements to most efficiently use inventory and provide real-time availability of material to our customers as they need it. And so, we're able to take that responsibility off their shoulders, being able to provide them the requirements when they need to maintain, obviously, the readiness levels that are necessary. And so overall, not just over the next five years, we think it's the right long-term solution for our customer. And we think again, it's just a win-win proposal for not just the joint -- the services, but also industry as a whole.\nJay Malave: And Kristine, we think we're on a path to establish a PBL with F-35 customer enterprise this year and that's what we're tracking too.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Rob Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Stallard: Thanks so much. Good morning.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nRob Stallard: Jim or Jay, now that you actually mentioned supply chain issues or labor shortages or other things in your commentary, so I was just wondering if you could give us an update on that situation and whether things have improved?\nJay Malave: Yes, it's a good question. Rob, our visibility we\u2019re going throughout the year, and I made a few comments -- I think the public comments in the quarter that we're looking at potentially at some shortfalls and partly that was due to the strong performance that we saw in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, the supply chain delivery, I think for the most part, there are still some pockets that we've seen particularly where it was impacting the most was at MFC and RMS, both of them had some continuing lingering issues that continue to plague us. On-time delivery performance really didn't get any better from Q4 and really what we saw in the back half of last year. So as we expected, really going back to when we reset expectations in the second quarter of 2022, we're really not expecting any type of significant recovery to the end of the year as we go into 2024. So, essentially more of the same in the first quarter from what we saw previously.\nJim Taiclet: And Rob, it's Jim. We're on the cusp of fully implementing really best practices in supply chain across this one Lockheed Martin concept that we have now, used to be that each business unit here or business areas, we call it, did its own supply chain management. And then within programs, it was even more narrowly managed. And so, we're now bringing all the aggregate demand together for each supplier across all of Lockheed Martin from space to MFC and everything in between. And then, we're also looking at components that programs are using in different parts of the company from mid-tier suppliers and aggregating that demand to actually synchronizing our requirements and so that we can have more and more bulk buys everything from raw materials up through mid-stage components, et cetera. So, we're implementing those, kind of, best practices that will be good for the supply base too. I don't have more reliable demand from our company in total and I think will lead -- I hope will lead the industry into that future, where we help strengthen the supply chain by our practices in addition to their improvements.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr: Yes, thanks so much. So, Jay, you had very strong profitability at MFC 15.8% was up and yet you talked of this classified missile program hitting, I think 50 bps to 100 bps on margins. Can you update us in terms of -- is that still what the number is given the strength in the first quarter and how far out into the future does that extend? And then maybe more broadly, Northrop also mentioned, maybe on B-21 that they have some fixed-price exposure looking out, do you have any other programs where we should be aware of potential, you know, LRIP or fixed price options on programs out in the future?\nJay Malave: Okay, thanks, Cai for the question. Let me just address specifically MFC they had -- did have a strong quarter. If you look throughout the year, where we go from here. In the quarter, they had essentially the highest profit adjustment quarter they're going to have, and so that's going to a step-down in the balance of the year. Secondly, we will see more of an impact from the dilutive margins associated with this classified program in the back half of the year as well. And so I would expect in a step-down in the 13% range in Q2, it will cycle down from there, we're still expecting the full-year to be in this 13.5% range really due to these two items. The step-up with profit adjustments will be lower for the balance of the year and the dilutive impact, it becomes more profound in the back half of the year. As far as other fixed-price production programs we\u2019re really -- that's pretty much the large one that we're tracking. We've had the program at Aeronautics, that -- we took a charge in 2021 and we continue to monitor that program, it's fixed-price development. We still have multiple years of development on that program, and so and that's one that we continue to keep an eye on. But I think, Greg Ulmer and his team are really managing that and laser-focused on driving to the customer\u2019s requirements in meeting their schedule and doing it when the cost objectives that we have currently laid out. Just going back to the MFC in terms of the outlook, we're going to be pressured on margins, probably for the next four to five years and predominantly from this program. It'll step up, it'll probably peak out in 2025 and then stabilize from there. The question -- other question I've been asked on MFC is whether they can grow absolute profit and the answer to that question is yes. And so while we may see some dilutive impact to margins, we may see profit maybe be flat from one year to another. Overall, over the next four to five years, we will see profit grow at MFC. And so, those are pretty much the answers to your questions. Thank you, Cai.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: Hey, good morning, guys.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nRon Epstein: A question for you -- maybe a bigger-picture question. Now Secretary Kendall was out without talking about NGAD and kind of restructuring that program so that more of the IP is owned by the DoD and having the constant re-competition of contractors and so on and so forth? How does that factor and how you think about that business model, does that really change anything? And I don't know if you could, kind of, speak about that?\nJim Taiclet: Ron, it's Jim. If we're constantly and have over the years, the company's history worked with government on intellectual property, management rights, et cetera. We'll continue to do that and got itself is a concept in progress, I'll call it. The government services, DoD et cetera, they are formalizing and crafting with NGAD is going to look like and then what NGAD stands for is Next-Generation Air Dominance aircraft. So, think F-15, F-22, that kind of class airplanes [Indiscernible] win air-to-air combat. And so, there'll be a mix of -- may accrued and uncrude vehicles in that concept, that's still being formulated. We're working with government through our Skunk Works operation on what the options are there. We'll sort out the intellectual property rules as we go forward. But frankly, we're driving and advocating strongly for a more open architecture approach to the entire industry, unless proprietary standards and protocols and architectures and we just demonstrated one of those with the docking mechanism for spacecraft, which can be basically implemented on any -- a wide range of spacecraft to do future replenishment of either data fees or fuel et cetera to satellites inflate. So those are the kinds of things we're advocating for and we will always guard and protect our intellectual property rights for the IP that we develop and we'll work with customers to create the open architecture, so that we can continue to compete effectively.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.\nPete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, everyone. Jim, I was just wondering if you can add some more color on sort of where Lockheed stands with Hypersonics just in light of the changes made to Aero and your Hawk variant. Obviously, CPS looks good, I don't know how big that could be, but could you walk us through maybe where you're at today in Hypersonics and with the program changes where things could go? How big you could get? Thanks.\nJim Taiclet: Sure, I'll take the construct and then offer Jay, the opportunity to, kind of, give you some scoping of where the business side of it could go and revenue growth et cetera. But Hypersonics is a -- it's a complex endeavor. You can, kind of, build a matrix in your mind, right? There's two different kinds of propulsion technologies, right? One is air breathing, so think a cruise missile type of vehicle where the -- there's atmospheric provision of oxygen going through inlet docked and it's aiding the propulsion system to continue forward. The other technology for propulsion is called boost glide, it's more like a kind of space rocket almost, and the fact that it's got either solid fuel rocket or equivalent to that. It gets a big boost off the launch vehicle or the Launch Pad and then the vehicle ultimately separates the glide body, it's called with the warhead from the rocket and on it goes, by it's basically momentum, it's already been provided from the boost. So, everything is one whose glides another, those are the two propulsion technologies. And then there are notions about the source of the launch, right? So, you could have ship based which is CPS, you can have land-based off of Tell vehicle, Transport Director, a launcher vehicle that the Army calls long-range hypersonic weapon or you could launch this often aircraft. And that's the matrix you have to go on your head, what proportion are we talking about and what launch platform, we're speaking about? So, let's just go really quickly through each of those. So ground based right now, there's essentially the long range hypersonic weapon is the game in town, it\u2019s very similar to the CPS, which is the ship-based vehicle. Its boost glide and it could be see it\u2019s surface launch seer or ground. That is where the government is placing its bet is on that joint program CPS and long range hypersonic weapon. You pointed out that we have that contract right now or executing on that for both services. Then when you get to Air Launched, you have the two propulsion systems, so Hawk and HALO are the air breathing, air launched vehicle, right? That the air launched vehicles have a size concern that you have to take into account. So what airplanes can carry such a product or such a weapon. The boost glide is a heavier larger vehicle, which we have been testing through the Aero program, and it's going to be a matter of what aircraft, the air force and ultimately the Navy want to use to bring the hypersonic weapons that they will have into the battle. And that's the debate and discussion that\u2019s going on in the services. That's the way to frame all this. Those are all government decisions. We're supporting really all of the matrix if you will at this point with either development program like Aero or production program like CPS. So I'll stop there and give Jay a chance to, kind of, give you some scope on what the growth for the company could be.\nJay Malave: Sure. It's -- today, it's about a $1.5 billion business for us in the aggregate, all of those programs that Jim mentioned. We expect that to continue to grow and be a contributor. It's one of our growth -- four growth pillars, it's not the largest because it's smaller than some of the other contributors. But it still provides healthy growth and there's upside to that related to hypersonic defense. And so when I talk about [$1.4 billion, $15 billion] (ph) going to with solid growth, it's embedded in our growth projection, it's really these weapons systems that Jim just mentioned.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Rich Safran from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead.\nRich Safran: Thank you, Jim, Jay, Maria, good morning.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nRich Safran: So I wanted to know if you could just expand on your opening remarks about international demand. Wanted to know if you could maybe discuss some of the timing of international award opportunities where you're seeing the most demand for what types of equipment? And finally here, are you seeing any more interest in direct commercial versus FMS in international orders that you're signing-up now? Thanks.\nJay Malave: Rich, good question on international. For us over the next five years or so, we expect international to be a significant contributor to our growth. It's embedded amongst each of our four pillars. But when you strip out international alone, you're talking high-single-digit growth there. As far as contracting most of that, particularly as you're dealing munitions is FMS, concluding it as well as F-35 program. So most of that right now that we've got embedded in our forecast, particularly on the growth side is FMS related. As Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're very excited about the Australian Military Satellite Communication program, it's a multi-billion dollar opportunity and that really expands the international footprint of our space business, which has historically been predominantly a domestic U.S.-based business. So these opportunities continue to present themselves, there was a lot more opportunity in front of us and that is absolutely a growth driver for us over the next five years.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. And I could add some more background to Jay's remarks there. As mentioned, space, there's like an incredible amount of upside, the notion of independent for sovereign satellite communication for military and national defense is catching on if you will. U.K. already has a system like this, but they want to replace and upgrade that. Australia is getting into that, a game as well and I think there'll be countries in the Middle-East and elsewhere that we'll look into these options for space. On the Aero side, the F-35 is been incredibly popular and I think on every competition. Meaningful competition over the last few years as far as fifth-generation fighter aircraft go. In addition to that F-16, we can build them fast enough with additional orders coming in. We're going to compete in India to try to get that order as well and it's a matter of us being able to get to the production rate that the international is demanding and requesting of us there. RMS is having a lot of success with the SEAHAWK helicopter for example and various versions of the Black Hawk. As we mentioned, Australia as part of that. Also the radar systems are becoming more exportable as we go forward and both in Europe and Asia there is demand for those. And then at MFC, obviously PAC-3 Javelin, GMLRS, ultimately potentially JASSM and LRASM for somewhere closer allies are going to be in the mix. So, there's a wide and broad range across all of our business areas, a significant international demand that we'll be seeing over the next few years. Contracting that through the FMS process does take some time. On the other hand, there are a few DCS programs and projects, but a lot of this is going to be -- continue to be export controlled by the U.S. government and there'll be largely FMS. But it's a broad range, it\u2019s going to last for many years, and we'll continue to be updating you on other programs, let's start getting more international traction.\nOperator: The next question is from Myles Walton from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks, good morning. Maybe on RMS, could you talk about the driver to the expansion in the margin implied in the guidance? I guess a couple of 100 basis points implied run-rate for the rest of the year. Is that something programmatic, was there extra R&D associated with FLRAA? And also on FLRAA now that, that decision is made. Anything you anticipate needing to do at Sikorsky to maintain competitiveness? Thanks.\nJay Malave: So, Myles, on your first question on RMS margins, you know, again the first quarter was 10%. We've got a guide of nearly 12% for the year. What happens is a little bit of the opposite of MFC. This was their lowest property adjustment quarter of the year. We expect that to grow based on the program schedules and the risk retirements that we foresee for the balance of the year and so that will step-up and just give you -- just to frame a reference. The first quarter their step-ups were about 20% of their profit. For the full-year, we're expecting that to be closer to 30% for profit adjustments for the full-year for RMS. So that will be a big contributor to the increase in profitability. The second element is that we have just some sales mix, we have some pass that attracts higher margin sales up in the second-half of the year, which will also give a boost to their margins. So that's fundamentally what's happening at RMS. As far as FLRAA, we had -- in any impacts related to Sikorsky, part of win announced a cost-reduction program in the fourth quarter had taken a few charges about $100 million of charges at RMS in the fourth quarter, about maybe half of that was related to Sikorsky and cost reduction and cost competitiveness. And so, we have just an interesting dynamic there that while we've got production, particularly in the Black Hawk stepping down here in 2023, it actually steps up slightly again in 2023 -- I'm sorry in 2024, and then we have significant growth on the CH-53 program in \u201824 where we're expecting to double our deliveries on that program. And so, we're just dealing with a one year-type of a trough I would say. I think the team, Stephanie Hill and her team have done a nice job of rightsizing the cost structure for where we are today, while at the same time maintaining the capability to provide us growth in the future.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Matt Akers from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nMatt Akers: Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. I wanted to ask about missiles and fire control, you made some comments in the opening remarks about some of the multi-year procurement programs going on now. When should we think about, sort of, transitioning from, kind of, flattish sales this year? I think you've talked about mid-single-digit. Growth and then also was there any investment needed to support that in terms of capacity scaling up your business there?\nJay Malave: Yes. So, when you look to get over the next five years at MFC, they're certainly our strongest grower, we'll lay out a little bit more specifics as we go through our strategic planning process in the summer and we give you, kind of, a first look on 2024 and maybe beyond when we do that in the October call. But I certainly are strongest grower. Yes, there are capacity investments. Jim mentioned some of the funding that is being proposed in the Presidential budget request for facilitation investments. We've also invested our own money\u2019s and capability PAC-3 is a good example. I mean, a few other programs where we've got in front of funding to make sure that we can deliver to the requirements for capacity and delivery requirements that our customers asking for. And so, again, I think we've got a good beat there. We've talked about different capacity levels over the next few years. We reached some of these levels in \u201825, \u201826 and \u201827. And that investment really between now and over the next few years is going to help enable that capacity increase in growth as well.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. And it's Jim, Matt. I could give you some details on exactly what we're talking about here. So for PAC-3 capacity 2022 is 450 and we're planning to make the investments and working with government to coordinate with us on this to 550 by 2026. So just three years from now, we'll go from 450 to 550. And then similar with the Javelin, which has been pretty widely discussed in the past. Our 2022 capacity was about 2,000 a year and by 2026, we'll have 3,500 plus, and ultimately, we're going to get to 4,000. When it comes to GMLRS, which is the HIMARS munition, the original capacity last year was 10,000. We're taking that to 14,000 by 2026. So these are meaningful step-ups, I guess you could call them in capacity and we're doing those, because we think we have a really strong demand for that capacity to fill it. And we're now programing, which customers go where and what point in time and working with the U.S. government to do that with -- along with their own priorities. So, we've got a significant plan to grow the business at MFC. There's investment either through our own rates and our CapEx plan plus funds committed by the government, because we are making a pretty strong case, I think with them to drive an anti-fragility program into munitions and other sort of high-importance production facilities and production systems. We got asked to double or triple production of certain munitions and the answer came back, as you see, it's going to take three years to do a lot of that. We want to get the fragility out of the system. So if this ever happens again, it's six months instead of three years to get a meaningful improvement in capacity and that's how you see the government acting now with the long-lead time parts in the [Indiscernible] and the multi-years that they are now implementing.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nJason Gursky: Book keeping question for you and then Jim, a more strategic one. Book keeping question, Jay, what kind of book-to-bill do you need to have this year to support the commentary about return to growth in \u201824 and is the timing of those awards important? And then for Jim, I'm going to just have you double-click a little bit on the Evolve initiative and the announcement that you made here recently with the Crescent Organization and supporting later communications. Just kind of curious from a big picture perspective, what kind of capital you're anticipating, putting into an organization like Crescent and the capital that you're going to be putting into this Evolve initiative over time?\nJay Malave: So let me just start with a book-to-bill question. Jason, essentially, it's one. Last year, we ended the book -- the backlog at $150 billion. This year, we're planning for that to be around the case maybe it's down $1 billion or up $1 billion. But effectively, a one book-to-bill sets us up for the growth to resume in 2024. So, we don't need to necessarily see the backlog. There is opportunity for it to grow from where we are, and where we landed or ended in 2022. But right now, we're planning for that to be generally flattish and that's where we need to be to drive the growth resumption in 2024.\nJim Taiclet: And Jason, let me put the whole notion of Evolve and Crescent into the overall strategy that accompany for you and give provide context that way. We've got three main strategic initiatives that the company that we're driving. One I just mentioned, is just to take the fragility of the production system, not just for Lockheed Martin, but for U.S. government and our industry and we just describe some of the ways that we're endeavoring to do that with government and so, that's the first strategy. The second one is, you've heard us talk about before 21st Century Security and that is working beyond the five defense primes in our supply chains to bring the latest and most advanced Newtonian and Digital Technologies International Defense and that means we have to work at Lockheed Martin with a wider variety of companies from the tech sector to laser-guided weapons, supply chain companies that we may not be doing current business with and they can be startups to Microsoft sized corporations. So, we are structuring our company to be able to participate and cooperate and collaborate with that much broader range of partners to deliver this 21st Century Security concept. And so, Evolve is meant to complement what we already had. We have a ventures group, Lockheed Martin Ventures that deals with start-ups that have a type technology that are promising for our core business. On the other side, we have partnerships and agreements and arrangements with our big five defense prime, so to speak. So, Northrop Grumman, us and BA for example work together on the F-35 aircraft and there are many, many of those. But what we needed in the middle was something to work with mid-sized companies and companies in the technology sector to work with us in ways that really don't have a traditional history with companies like Lockheed Martin, our peer group. And so, Evolve is now meant to be able to do joint ventures, co-investments, commercial arrangements with mid-sized to large companies outside of our normal sphere so to speak, and deliver on new capabilities for space exploration and also for national defense. And so, present is the business that we\u2019ll work with others outside of Lockheed Martin to figure out how to finance and then how to implement and how to sustain lunar service right for everything from transportation on the surface to basically the Uber for the moon, if you will at the end of the day, to the communications and positioning and navigation systems that you need to have on orbit around the moon, so that you can actually operate on the lunar surface with either robotics or with humans. So [Indiscernible] has designed to do that. The capital that we will deploy to build that type of business will be more creatively sourced, right? It will not just -- it will not come out of the disclosure statement that goes back to the DoD or NASA into our rates, right? It's going to be independently source, we may contribute, our partners may contribute directly, but they will be outside the rate structure and the federal acquisition regulations. So that we can get the full benefit of those investments overtime, and also creative -- more creatively finance them and partner with others to do that. So that's the concept that's why we're doing it and we intend to grow it without necessarily burdening the CapEx disclosure statement and ramifications of that to the company.\nJay Malave: And by breaking it out of the business area, business says structure enables these ideas in these pursuits to really operate at a speed and agility level. It probably wouldn't otherwise be available to them working within the bureaucratic structure that we have in our business areas with the multi -- all the policies and procedures that we have. And so, we give them a little bit more flexibility to operate with some speed. And as Jim mentioned, the ability to pursue co-investment by others as well.\nOperator: The next question is from the line of Scott Deuschle from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning. Jay, if I were to model Q2 through Q4 space systems sales based-off of Q1. And then just to adjust for increased number of weeks in those future reporting periods? And go get around $12.8 billion space segment sales for the year versus the guidance midpoint of $11.6 billion? So basically 10% higher than what you've guided. So, curious if you comment on what prevents that type of upside case from happening or to ask another way, what the volume headwinds are and the remainder of the year relative to the first quarter? Thank you.\nJay Malave: You know, it's a good question, Scott. And as I mentioned in my remarks, it's excellent growth from Next Gen Interceptor Classified programs and National Security Space, areas that you would expect. But they also had some growth and I mentioned that there was boosted, protect -- some protected comms programs Orion, fleet ballistic missiles. Those are programs we're expecting to be a little bit more steady state. And so they just were -- they just benefited from some program timing here in the quarter. And just to give you an example, protected comms is up 50% in the quarter. We're expecting that to generally be flat for the year. Orion was up 20% in the quarter. We're expecting that to generally be flat for the year. FBM was up about 20% in the quarter and that was pretty much the full-years\u2019 worth of growth all in the first quarter. And so just these things all came together here in the first quarter, that really caused this growth of 16%. We expect this program that I just mentioned to really normalize in the balance of the year. We will continue to see some growth on some of these other programs. I will acknowledge there probably is some upside to their sales, but it's not $1 billion that you're nearly talking anywhere between $100 million to $200 million of probably upside to where we are today.\nOperator: Next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. Jay, I wanted to pursue some of these other income numbers, because they were actually a big part of the large beat this quarter relative to my expectation anyway. So if you look at the other net that's in operating income, it was $2 million. You kept the guide at minus $3.25 million for the year. So what happens in the subsequent quarters? It's all negative 100 plus or is there some quarter that it's abnormally high? And then somewhat less, but other non-operating income was $49 million. You disclosed $29 million of that was the venture stuff, what was the other $20 million. And I left out the $29 million in the other net number, which was for deferred compensation adjustment.\nJay Malave: Okay. Let me -- so George, a fair question. Just to -- you may tackle a big question, the big picture question in terms of what happens for the balance of the year. Just on the investment gains, obviously we saw that in the quarter. We talked about that being $0.18 imply, because we're not changing it implies that we're reversing the balance of the year, so we'll see. We'll give that an update in the second quarter, update more halfway through the year and make a call on that. The other element we just were speaking about a little bit in terms of our investment in LM Evolve, we have some of those investments increasing in the balance of the year as well. And then there's just residual corporate costs that we have flowing through. And so all those things are allocated. We'll monitor those throughout the rest of the year and see whether or not. Again, I think we'll just make an assessment halfway through the year on where we are those things to the extent there's upside, we'll make an update at that point in time.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKen Herbert: Hi, good morning. Jay or Jim, I wanted to see if you can provide a little more granularity on the TR3 and the F-35 program. Specifically, it seems like that program is faced in ongoing delays and other headwinds in terms of adoption and implementation. But how is that impacting deliveries this year and how do you see that timing of that getting back on track?\nJim Taiclet: Yes, Ken, it\u2019s Jim. In the round, we're in the very late innings of it fully implementing this Tech Refresh 3. The point of it is really critical and that is it gives us much, much greater capability to really make the F-35 a true edge compute node in an open architecture, Internet of Things construct a system. And so the three elements of a edge compute node in a 5G system are data storage onboard, the vehicle, data processing on board the vehicle, multipath ability to get back to the cloud, right, finding the cloud as to whatever you're enterprise is. And the TR3 upgrade provides all of that. It's coming together of a number of components I'll call them and subcomponents, which is pretty intricate, fairly leading edge for the aerospace industry to accomplish and it's being done. So there has been some delays in some of the hardware and software. But we're really in the very late innings of getting this all together. We're literally in flight test right now and will we wrap all that up by October or December or et cetera. We've got to see what the test results are. And work with the government to define exactly when everybody is ready to go and implement in our production system, in the factory, those software loads, and that's where we're at now. So I would consider this extremely high degree of difficulty dive and we're going to make sure that it's done right. And we can prove set rate in our Block 15, so that's what we're up to and we're working closely with the joint program office to define that and make that successful. And we are seeing the demand for the aircraft both from the U.S. and international customers really, kind of, blossom here lately. So I think we're in good shape on the program.\nMaria Ricciardone Lee: All right. Lois, this is Maria. I think we've come to the top of the hour. So I'm just going to quickly turn it back to Jim for any final thoughts.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. As we conclude, I'd like to say thank you to our 116,000 employees here at Lockheed Martin for their commitment to providing our is the 21st Century Digital and Physical Technologies that will help them deter conflict and win if they have to. So thank you all again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. And Lois, that concludes our call today.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference service. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2023 earnings call. I'd like to begin today with a few highlights from the quarter, as well as an overview of the Presidential Budget Request and then Jay will discuss our financial results and full-year 2023 outlook in detail. We had a solid start to the year with first quarter sales of $15.1 billion led by 16% year-over-year growth at space. Segment operating margin was 11.1% led by MFC at 15.8%. Free cash flow grew 11% to $1.3 billion and combined with the lower share count contributed to a strong free cash flow for share growth year-over-year. We remain on track to meet our financial expectations for the full-year and the return to growth in 2024 as we laid out in January. In terms of capital deployment, we returned $1.3 billion or 101% of our free cash flow to shareholders in the quarter. We remain focused on our long-term strategy of growing free cash flow per share and continue to plan to deliver approximately 110% of our free cash flow to stockholders in 2023 through dividends and buybacks. Turning to the budget. The administration released preliminary details of the FY \u201824 President's Budget Request or PBR in early March. This budget proposal reflects a heightened emphasis on defense and security cooperation with allies. The FY \u201824 DoD budget request is $842 billion an increase of $25 billion or 3% over the FY \u201823 enacted funding. The near peer threats posed by China and the Russian invasion of Ukraine is driving the national defense strategy and has created added demand for Lockheed Martin's advanced effective solutions. Key highlights include the procurement of 83 F-35 aircraft continued expansion in classified programs and an increase in requested funding for munitions. The PBR also includes facilitation investment and advanced funding for long lead time parts in support of multi-year procurement of JASSM and LRASM. We're also engaged with DoD on multi-year procurement proposals for PAC-3 MSE and guided multiple launch rocket systems. These proposals are subject to congressional approval during course of the FY '24 defense authorization and appropriations process. The PBR also includes continued investments in key technology development efforts such as conventional prompt strike, long range Hypersonic weapon, next generation interceptor, Hypersonic defense, bomb defense system and other space programs. Furthermore, key technology areas aligned with Lockheed Martin investment priorities received increased funding to include microelectronics, 5G technologies and joint all domain operations. We are encouraged by this initial request and look forward to its progression through the authorization and appropriations process. We also anticipate heightened emphasis on national security prioritization from Congress, supplemental spending requests including Ukraine and elevated demand from allies and partners. Turning to the F-35 program, the 83 F-35 Lightning II aircraft included in the PBR signaled strong support from the services and the administration. Moreover, the Canadian government's January announcement that it will procure 88 F-35s marks another milestone in continued international demand for the aircraft. As to production, deliveries of F-35 engines which are government furnished equipment resumed in February. And then flight operations and deliveries resumed in March. However, we do expect a fraction of total expected 2023 deliveries to be impacted later this year, due to both software maturation related to Technology Refresh 3 or TR3 and hardware delivery timing. However, we anticipate little to no revenue impact from any potential delivery delay and therefore no material adverse effect on our 2023 P&L. Jay will provide some more color on this in a moment. Also at Aeronautics, the first Greenville built F-16 Block 70 took flight and was delivered to Bahrain. In addition to the Bahrain customer six countries have selected Block 70 or 72 aircraft and Jordan and Bulgaria have signed letters of agreement for additional jets. Further related to the F-16 in the quarter, while I was at the U.S.-India CEO form in March, I had the privilege to announce the memorandum of understanding with the Tata Lockheed Martin Aero Structure Limited joint venture to produce F-16 wing structures in India demonstrating our commitment to India as an industry partner and customer, while bolstering our supply chain. Turning to Hypersonics, it is encouraging to see the continued investment outlined in the PBR for the conventional prompt strike weapon system or CPS. As it begins integration and testing for Zumwalt Class Ships recognizing our advancements in this critical technology. In February, the U.S. Navy awarded Lockheed Martin an initial contract for CPS, the first sea based hypersonic strike capability for the United States. Enabling long range missile flight at speeds greater than Mach 5. First delivery is expected by the mid-2020s. Regarding our Air launch rapid response weapon also known as Aero, we are continuing testing of the system at hypersonic speeds in order to advance technical maturation of the missile and the glide body and to ensure the final product is safe, reliable and supportive of our customers' missions and future plans. In January, we also completed the second flight test of hypersonic air breathing weapons concept also known as Hawk in partnership with DARPA and the Air Force Research Lab. We accomplished all the test objectives during the second flight test, including affordable rapid development and performance requirements. And in late March, the U.S. Navy announced its support of the hypersonic air launched offensive anti surface strike weapon or HALO. Lockheed Martin was down selected and awarded a contract for the first step to fielding a critical capability over the next decade and begin the design and development of a carrier based air breathing hypersonic strike capability for the Navy's fleet. As a company, we remain fully committed to developing hypersonic technology on accelerated timelines to meet this critical national security need and establish a solid deterrent posture in this area for the U.S. and its allies. The hypersonic solutions are just one element in our vision of 21st Century security. We advanced several additional aspects of this strategy during the quarter, including announcing a memorandum of understanding with Juniper Networks to jointly develop integrated hybrid software defined wide area network solutions and to demonstrate that with our customers in the future. This technology enables Mission Aware Dynamic Routing, a foundational capability for resilient joint all domain operations. This mission where dynamic routing shifts the movement of data and communications in real time across a mix of military and commercial infrastructure according to evolving conditions. Our solutions give customers the flexibility to rapidly adapt to maintain the flow of crucial data and information as their assets operate in contested environments. We also led simulations of technologies to the U.S. Army, Air Force and Navy to demonstrate the impacts of 5G communications and advanced analytics to significantly improve operations and maintenance performance for a variety of aircraft, as well as for unmanned platforms and operationally challenging environments. And at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, I had the opportunity to deliver a keynote address and meet with CEOs across the digital technology, mobile and networking industries to encourage us working together to promote innovative solutions to protect our countries and advance our space exploration capabilities. Another example of our leadership in accelerating advanced 21st Century technologies to improve national defense and deterrence to conflict is in the arena of directed energy. Recently, our RMS unit achieved success in our initial test of our demos. High energy laser, which verifies that the laser's optical performance meets the system's targeted design parameters. This 50 kilowatt class laser weapon system aligns with the Army's directed energy, short range air defense mission. In addition to delivering on absolutely cutting edge technologies, demand for many of our well-known and long-time high performing systems continues to be strong. For example, in January, the Australian government announced the purchase of 20 Lockheed Martin high mobility artillery rocket systems or the now familiar High Mars, providing Australian defense force with a reliable, well proven capability. And we continue to grow our significant partnership with Australia beyond High Mars. In February, an agreement was announced between the Australian and United States governments for a foreign military sale of 40 UH-60M Black Hawks for the Australian Army and deliveries are slated to begin early this year. The Black Hawk remains unmatched as an all-around, multi role durable military helicopter for Australia and for the 34 other countries around the globe that use it. Further, we're excited to work with the ADF and Australian industry to develop their sovereign satellite communications component, otherwise known there as joint Project 9102. The Commonwealth of Australia announced in April that Lockheed Martin was selected as the preferred bidder for JP-9102. This multibillion dollar project will provide the ADF with a robust solution for military satellite communications and defined by its versatility and its resilience. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jay and join you later for questions. Thanks, Kristine. It's an excellent question. We did estimate a proposal, we are expecting that to be decided by the end of the year and awarded. And we think this is the best solution for the customer, not only over the next five years, but frankly, over the -- this is the right program for the life of the program. And what this offers is really a win-win type of solution. It enables us to utilize our proprietary modeling for material requirements to most efficiently use inventory and provide real-time availability of material to our customers as they need it. And so, we're able to take that responsibility off their shoulders, being able to provide them the requirements when they need to maintain, obviously, the readiness levels that are necessary. And so overall, not just over the next five years, we think it's the right long-term solution for our customer. And we think again, it's just a win-win proposal for not just the joint -- the services, but also industry as a whole. Good morning. And Rob, it's Jim. We're on the cusp of fully implementing really best practices in supply chain across this one Lockheed Martin concept that we have now, used to be that each business unit here or business areas, we call it, did its own supply chain management. And then within programs, it was even more narrowly managed. And so, we're now bringing all the aggregate demand together for each supplier across all of Lockheed Martin from space to MFC and everything in between. And then, we're also looking at components that programs are using in different parts of the company from mid-tier suppliers and aggregating that demand to actually synchronizing our requirements and so that we can have more and more bulk buys everything from raw materials up through mid-stage components, et cetera. So, we're implementing those, kind of, best practices that will be good for the supply base too. I don't have more reliable demand from our company in total and I think will lead -- I hope will lead the industry into that future, where we help strengthen the supply chain by our practices in addition to their improvements. Good morning. Ron, it's Jim. If we're constantly and have over the years, the company's history worked with government on intellectual property, management rights, et cetera. We'll continue to do that and got itself is a concept in progress, I'll call it. The government services, DoD et cetera, they are formalizing and crafting with NGAD is going to look like and then what NGAD stands for is Next-Generation Air Dominance aircraft. So, think F-15, F-22, that kind of class airplanes [Indiscernible] win air-to-air combat. And so, there'll be a mix of -- may accrued and uncrude vehicles in that concept, that's still being formulated. We're working with government through our Skunk Works operation on what the options are there. We'll sort out the intellectual property rules as we go forward. But frankly, we're driving and advocating strongly for a more open architecture approach to the entire industry, unless proprietary standards and protocols and architectures and we just demonstrated one of those with the docking mechanism for spacecraft, which can be basically implemented on any -- a wide range of spacecraft to do future replenishment of either data fees or fuel et cetera to satellites inflate. So those are the kinds of things we're advocating for and we will always guard and protect our intellectual property rights for the IP that we develop and we'll work with customers to create the open architecture, so that we can continue to compete effectively. Sure, I'll take the construct and then offer Jay, the opportunity to, kind of, give you some scoping of where the business side of it could go and revenue growth et cetera. But Hypersonics is a -- it's a complex endeavor. You can, kind of, build a matrix in your mind, right? There's two different kinds of propulsion technologies, right? One is air breathing, so think a cruise missile type of vehicle where the -- there's atmospheric provision of oxygen going through inlet docked and it's aiding the propulsion system to continue forward. The other technology for propulsion is called boost glide, it's more like a kind of space rocket almost, and the fact that it's got either solid fuel rocket or equivalent to that. It gets a big boost off the launch vehicle or the Launch Pad and then the vehicle ultimately separates the glide body, it's called with the warhead from the rocket and on it goes, by it's basically momentum, it's already been provided from the boost. So, everything is one whose glides another, those are the two propulsion technologies. And then there are notions about the source of the launch, right? So, you could have ship based which is CPS, you can have land-based off of Tell vehicle, Transport Director, a launcher vehicle that the Army calls long-range hypersonic weapon or you could launch this often aircraft. And that's the matrix you have to go on your head, what proportion are we talking about and what launch platform, we're speaking about? So, let's just go really quickly through each of those. So ground based right now, there's essentially the long range hypersonic weapon is the game in town, it's very similar to the CPS, which is the ship-based vehicle. Its boost glide and it could be see it's surface launch seer or ground. That is where the government is placing its bet is on that joint program CPS and long range hypersonic weapon. You pointed out that we have that contract right now or executing on that for both services. Then when you get to Air Launched, you have the two propulsion systems, so Hawk and HALO are the air breathing, air launched vehicle, right? That the air launched vehicles have a size concern that you have to take into account. So what airplanes can carry such a product or such a weapon. The boost glide is a heavier larger vehicle, which we have been testing through the Aero program, and it's going to be a matter of what aircraft, the air force and ultimately the Navy want to use to bring the hypersonic weapons that they will have into the battle. And that's the debate and discussion that's going on in the services. That's the way to frame all this. Those are all government decisions. We're supporting really all of the matrix if you will at this point with either development program like Aero or production program like CPS. So I'll stop there and give Jay a chance to, kind of, give you some scope on what the growth for the company could be. Good morning. Yes. And I could add some more background to Jay's remarks there. As mentioned, space, there's like an incredible amount of upside, the notion of independent for sovereign satellite communication for military and national defense is catching on if you will. U.K. already has a system like this, but they want to replace and upgrade that. Australia is getting into that, a game as well and I think there'll be countries in the Middle-East and elsewhere that we'll look into these options for space. On the Aero side, the F-35 is been incredibly popular and I think on every competition. Meaningful competition over the last few years as far as fifth-generation fighter aircraft go. In addition to that F-16, we can build them fast enough with additional orders coming in. We're going to compete in India to try to get that order as well and it's a matter of us being able to get to the production rate that the international is demanding and requesting of us there. RMS is having a lot of success with the SEAHAWK helicopter for example and various versions of the Black Hawk. As we mentioned, Australia as part of that. Also the radar systems are becoming more exportable as we go forward and both in Europe and Asia there is demand for those. And then at MFC, obviously PAC-3 Javelin, GMLRS, ultimately potentially JASSM and LRASM for somewhere closer allies are going to be in the mix. So, there's a wide and broad range across all of our business areas, a significant international demand that we'll be seeing over the next few years. Contracting that through the FMS process does take some time. On the other hand, there are a few DCS programs and projects, but a lot of this is going to be -- continue to be export controlled by the U.S. government and there'll be largely FMS. But it's a broad range, it's going to last for many years, and we'll continue to be updating you on other programs, let's start getting more international traction. Yes. And it's Jim, Matt. I could give you some details on exactly what we're talking about here. So for PAC-3 capacity 2022 is 450 and we're planning to make the investments and working with government to coordinate with us on this to 550 by 2026. So just three years from now, we'll go from 450 to 550. And then similar with the Javelin, which has been pretty widely discussed in the past. Our 2022 capacity was about 2,000 a year and by 2026, we'll have 3,500 plus, and ultimately, we're going to get to 4,000. When it comes to GMLRS, which is the HIMARS munition, the original capacity last year was 10,000. We're taking that to 14,000 by 2026. So these are meaningful step-ups, I guess you could call them in capacity and we're doing those, because we think we have a really strong demand for that capacity to fill it. And we're now programing, which customers go where and what point in time and working with the U.S. government to do that with -- along with their own priorities. So, we've got a significant plan to grow the business at MFC. There's investment either through our own rates and our CapEx plan plus funds committed by the government, because we are making a pretty strong case, I think with them to drive an anti-fragility program into munitions and other sort of high-importance production facilities and production systems. We got asked to double or triple production of certain munitions and the answer came back, as you see, it's going to take three years to do a lot of that. We want to get the fragility out of the system. So if this ever happens again, it's six months instead of three years to get a meaningful improvement in capacity and that's how you see the government acting now with the long-lead time parts in the [Indiscernible] and the multi-years that they are now implementing. And Jason, let me put the whole notion of Evolve and Crescent into the overall strategy that accompany for you and give provide context that way. We've got three main strategic initiatives that the company that we're driving. One I just mentioned, is just to take the fragility of the production system, not just for Lockheed Martin, but for U.S. government and our industry and we just describe some of the ways that we're endeavoring to do that with government and so, that's the first strategy. The second one is, you've heard us talk about before 21st Century Security and that is working beyond the five defense primes in our supply chains to bring the latest and most advanced Newtonian and Digital Technologies International Defense and that means we have to work at Lockheed Martin with a wider variety of companies from the tech sector to laser-guided weapons, supply chain companies that we may not be doing current business with and they can be startups to Microsoft sized corporations. So, we are structuring our company to be able to participate and cooperate and collaborate with that much broader range of partners to deliver this 21st Century Security concept. And so, Evolve is meant to complement what we already had. We have a ventures group, Lockheed Martin Ventures that deals with start-ups that have a type technology that are promising for our core business. On the other side, we have partnerships and agreements and arrangements with our big five defense prime, so to speak. So, Northrop Grumman, us and BA for example work together on the F-35 aircraft and there are many, many of those. But what we needed in the middle was something to work with mid-sized companies and companies in the technology sector to work with us in ways that really don't have a traditional history with companies like Lockheed Martin, our peer group. And so, Evolve is now meant to be able to do joint ventures, co-investments, commercial arrangements with mid-sized to large companies outside of our normal sphere so to speak, and deliver on new capabilities for space exploration and also for national defense. And so, present is the business that we'll work with others outside of Lockheed Martin to figure out how to finance and then how to implement and how to sustain lunar service right for everything from transportation on the surface to basically the Uber for the moon, if you will at the end of the day, to the communications and positioning and navigation systems that you need to have on orbit around the moon, so that you can actually operate on the lunar surface with either robotics or with humans. So [Indiscernible] has designed to do that. The capital that we will deploy to build that type of business will be more creatively sourced, right? It will not just -- it will not come out of the disclosure statement that goes back to the DoD or NASA into our rates, right? It's going to be independently source, we may contribute, our partners may contribute directly, but they will be outside the rate structure and the federal acquisition regulations. So that we can get the full benefit of those investments overtime, and also creative -- more creatively finance them and partner with others to do that. So that's the concept that's why we're doing it and we intend to grow it without necessarily burdening the CapEx disclosure statement and ramifications of that to the company. Yes, Ken, it's Jim. In the round, we're in the very late innings of it fully implementing this Tech Refresh 3. The point of it is really critical and that is it gives us much, much greater capability to really make the F-35 a true edge compute node in an open architecture, Internet of Things construct a system. And so the three elements of a edge compute node in a 5G system are data storage onboard, the vehicle, data processing on board the vehicle, multipath ability to get back to the cloud, right, finding the cloud as to whatever you're enterprise is. And the TR3 upgrade provides all of that. It's coming together of a number of components I'll call them and subcomponents, which is pretty intricate, fairly leading edge for the aerospace industry to accomplish and it's being done. So there has been some delays in some of the hardware and software. But we're really in the very late innings of getting this all together. We're literally in flight test right now and will we wrap all that up by October or December or et cetera. We've got to see what the test results are. And work with the government to define exactly when everybody is ready to go and implement in our production system, in the factory, those software loads, and that's where we're at now. So I would consider this extremely high degree of difficulty dive and we're going to make sure that it's done right. And we can prove set rate in our Block 15, so that's what we're up to and we're working closely with the joint program office to define that and make that successful. And we are seeing the demand for the aircraft both from the U.S. and international customers really, kind of, blossom here lately. So I think we're in good shape on the program. Thanks, Maria. As we conclude, I'd like to say thank you to our 116,000 employees here at Lockheed Martin for their commitment to providing our is the 21st Century Digital and Physical Technologies that will help them deter conflict and win if they have to. So thank you all again for joining us today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. And Lois, that concludes our call today."

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thanks Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I will walk you through our consolidated and business area results for the first quarter and cover our 2023 outlook. As I highlight our results, please follow along with the web charts we have posted with our earnings release today. Let's begin with chart three and an overview of consolidated financial results. Overall, 2023 is off to a solid start, positioning us well to meet our commitments for the year. We delivered just over $15 billion in sales with $1.7 billion in segment operating profit, resulting in 11.1% segment operating margin. Earnings per share was $6.61 and we generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow, enabling a solid shareholder return to share repurchases, and dividends. Our book-to-bill ratio for the first quarter was 0.7 as anticipated. With backlog expected to increase in the second quarter, from the upcoming order for F-35 Lot 17 production. And we continue to strategically invest in our growth strategy with $600 million of capital expenditures and independent research and development this quarter. These financial results are on track with our expectations for the year. Taking a closer look at the quarter's results with consolidated sales and segment operating profit on chart four, first quarter sales increased year-over-year by 1% as space led the way with 16% growth. Segment operating profit was down 2% as lower ULA equity earnings and contract mix more than offset the benefits from slightly higher volume and step ups. As expected, margins contracted mostly due to the lower equity earnings from ULA. Moving to earnings per share on chart five. GAAP earnings per share were up $0.17 or 3% over 2022. Adjusted for mark-to-market investment gains, EPS was flat. On an adjusted basis, the unfavorable year-over-year impacts from segment operating profit, interest expense and FAS/CAS pension income were offset by the lower share count. Moving to cash flow on chart six, we generated nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, including nearly $300 million of capital expenditures, as well as over $600 million of accelerated payments and continued support of the supply chain. Our cash deployment plan is on track, which we expect to accelerate throughout the year. In the quarter, we had $500 million of share repurchases and paid almost $800 million in quarterly dividends. Total cash return to shareholders in the quarter was 101% of free cash flow. Moving to segment results and starting with Aeronautics on chart seven. First quarter sales at Aero decreased 2% year-over-year. Lower F-35 production sales were partially offset by higher F-16 and classified program volumes. Operating profit was slightly lower than prior year as the impact from lower net profit adjustments and sales volume was partially offset by favorable contract mix. For the year, we expect F-35 deliveries to be lower than previously anticipated due to software maturation with the Tech Refresh 3 program and hardware delivery timing. We will refine the impact as the year progresses, but do not expect the change to Aero's 2023 sales and profit ranges that we had previously communicated in January as we maintain our production cost throughput profile for the year. Looking at Missiles and Fire Control on page eight, sales decreased 3% as lower sales volume on sensors and global sustainment, as well as our tactical strike missile programs were partially offset by growth in integrated air and missile defense. Segment operating profit was down 2%, driven by lower sales volumes and net profit adjustments, partially offset by favorable contract mix. At Rotary and Mission Systems on page nine, sales were down 1% from 2022, driven by lower volume on Black Hawk production and our C6 ISR programs. These declines were partially offset by favorable volume on radar programs and integrated warfare systems and sensors. Including Defense of Guam, an important growth area for RMS that was won in 2022. Operating profit decreased 14%, due to lower sales volume and timing of net profit adjustments. Turning to chart 10 and our space business area. Sales were up 16% in the quarter driven by strong growth on the next gen interceptor and classified programs and further boosted by favorable program lifecycle timing on Orion, protective communications, and fleet ballistic missile programs. Operating profit was up 13%, driven by the increase in volume and favorable profit adjustments partially offset by the lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance. Okay. Now shifting to the outlook for 2023 on page 11. For the year, we are reaffirming guidance for all key metrics. We continue to expect sales to be in the range of $65 billion to $66 billion with segment operating margin at 11.2% at the midpoint. We also still expect to deliver free cash flow at or above $6.2 billion, while repurchasing $4 billion of outstanding shares. We believe our first quarter results position us to achieve these expectations as we continue to add orders, we program execution commitments and pursue new opportunities throughout the year. Right, so let's close on page 12 to summarize with the comments. As noted, first quarter represents a solid start to 2023. We reaffirm key financial metrics as previously guided and continue to expect a return to growth in 2024 and beyond. With consistent free cash flow per share growth. Looking ahead, our strategic focus on 21st Century Security Solutions aligns with expected increases to defense and security spending. With our continued discipline and focus on execution, we are on track to meet our expectations for long-term growth and value creation for our shareholders. With that Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A. Great question, Seth. Let me just say on FLRAA. We're obviously disappointed. We believe that our offering was the best technology to support the multi-mission requirements at the best value. And while we'll acknowledge that the proposal did include aggressive pricing, a significant amount of our offering included efficiencies made possible by the benefits of 1LMX. And our adoption of 1LMX model-based and digital thread enhancements significantly improved our cost competitiveness and we expect that to continue in the future. The business case itself was favorable and that's what enabled the pricing that we were able to offer. As it relates to -- I think generally speaking, that's how we evaluate these proposals. We look at the NPV, we look at IRR, we looked at all different metrics, we look at current affordability. And as I mentioned at your conference Seth, I've said it, in a classified program at MFC, we have to take a little bit of short-term pain for some long-term gain. But the fact of the matter is the business case does provide that long-term gain for us. And so, we go through all of that as part of the management decision making, the technology that we can provide. As you would expect, we have the leverage, we have the capability of wherewithal to provide favorable pricing in outstanding technology offerings to our customer, and we don't do it at the expense of financial returns. Let me just add, just on the CH-53K, we did have something in the press release. There was a small adjustment related to a development contract -- an older development contract, there was no adjustments taken on the forward production agreements that we're working on currently. And Kristine, we think we're on a path to establish a PBL with F-35 customer enterprise this year and that's what we're tracking too. Yes, it's a good question. Rob, our visibility we're going throughout the year, and I made a few comments -- I think the public comments in the quarter that we're looking at potentially at some shortfalls and partly that was due to the strong performance that we saw in the fourth quarter. Ultimately, the supply chain delivery, I think for the most part, there are still some pockets that we've seen particularly where it was impacting the most was at MFC and RMS, both of them had some continuing lingering issues that continue to plague us. On-time delivery performance really didn't get any better from Q4 and really what we saw in the back half of last year. So as we expected, really going back to when we reset expectations in the second quarter of 2022, we're really not expecting any type of significant recovery to the end of the year as we go into 2024. So, essentially more of the same in the first quarter from what we saw previously. Okay, thanks, Cai for the question. Let me just address specifically MFC they had -- did have a strong quarter. If you look throughout the year, where we go from here. In the quarter, they had essentially the highest profit adjustment quarter they're going to have, and so that's going to a step-down in the balance of the year. Secondly, we will see more of an impact from the dilutive margins associated with this classified program in the back half of the year as well. And so I would expect in a step-down in the 13% range in Q2, it will cycle down from there, we're still expecting the full-year to be in this 13.5% range really due to these two items. The step-up with profit adjustments will be lower for the balance of the year and the dilutive impact, it becomes more profound in the back half of the year. As far as other fixed-price production programs we're really -- that's pretty much the large one that we're tracking. We've had the program at Aeronautics, that -- we took a charge in 2021 and we continue to monitor that program, it's fixed-price development. We still have multiple years of development on that program, and so and that's one that we continue to keep an eye on. But I think, Greg Ulmer and his team are really managing that and laser-focused on driving to the customer's requirements in meeting their schedule and doing it when the cost objectives that we have currently laid out. Just going back to the MFC in terms of the outlook, we're going to be pressured on margins, probably for the next four to five years and predominantly from this program. It'll step up, it'll probably peak out in 2025 and then stabilize from there. The question -- other question I've been asked on MFC is whether they can grow absolute profit and the answer to that question is yes. And so while we may see some dilutive impact to margins, we may see profit maybe be flat from one year to another. Overall, over the next four to five years, we will see profit grow at MFC. And so, those are pretty much the answers to your questions. Thank you, Cai. Sure. It's -- today, it's about a $1.5 billion business for us in the aggregate, all of those programs that Jim mentioned. We expect that to continue to grow and be a contributor. It's one of our growth -- four growth pillars, it's not the largest because it's smaller than some of the other contributors. But it still provides healthy growth and there's upside to that related to hypersonic defense. And so when I talk about [$1.4 billion, $15 billion] (ph) going to with solid growth, it's embedded in our growth projection, it's really these weapons systems that Jim just mentioned. Rich, good question on international. For us over the next five years or so, we expect international to be a significant contributor to our growth. It's embedded amongst each of our four pillars. But when you strip out international alone, you're talking high-single-digit growth there. As far as contracting most of that, particularly as you're dealing munitions is FMS, concluding it as well as F-35 program. So most of that right now that we've got embedded in our forecast, particularly on the growth side is FMS related. As Jim mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're very excited about the Australian Military Satellite Communication program, it's a multi-billion dollar opportunity and that really expands the international footprint of our space business, which has historically been predominantly a domestic U.S.-based business. So these opportunities continue to present themselves, there was a lot more opportunity in front of us and that is absolutely a growth driver for us over the next five years. So, Myles, on your first question on RMS margins, you know, again the first quarter was 10%. We've got a guide of nearly 12% for the year. What happens is a little bit of the opposite of MFC. This was their lowest property adjustment quarter of the year. We expect that to grow based on the program schedules and the risk retirements that we foresee for the balance of the year and so that will step-up and just give you -- just to frame a reference. The first quarter their step-ups were about 20% of their profit. For the full-year, we're expecting that to be closer to 30% for profit adjustments for the full-year for RMS. So that will be a big contributor to the increase in profitability. The second element is that we have just some sales mix, we have some pass that attracts higher margin sales up in the second-half of the year, which will also give a boost to their margins. So that's fundamentally what's happening at RMS. As far as FLRAA, we had -- in any impacts related to Sikorsky, part of win announced a cost-reduction program in the fourth quarter had taken a few charges about $100 million of charges at RMS in the fourth quarter, about maybe half of that was related to Sikorsky and cost reduction and cost competitiveness. And so, we have just an interesting dynamic there that while we've got production, particularly in the Black Hawk stepping down here in 2023, it actually steps up slightly again in 2023 -- I'm sorry in 2024, and then we have significant growth on the CH-53 program in \u201824 where we're expecting to double our deliveries on that program. And so, we're just dealing with a one year-type of a trough I would say. I think the team, Stephanie Hill and her team have done a nice job of rightsizing the cost structure for where we are today, while at the same time maintaining the capability to provide us growth in the future. Yes. So, when you look to get over the next five years at MFC, they're certainly our strongest grower, we'll lay out a little bit more specifics as we go through our strategic planning process in the summer and we give you, kind of, a first look on 2024 and maybe beyond when we do that in the October call. But I certainly are strongest grower. Yes, there are capacity investments. Jim mentioned some of the funding that is being proposed in the Presidential budget request for facilitation investments. We've also invested our own money's and capability PAC-3 is a good example. I mean, a few other programs where we've got in front of funding to make sure that we can deliver to the requirements for capacity and delivery requirements that our customers asking for. And so, again, I think we've got a good beat there. We've talked about different capacity levels over the next few years. We reached some of these levels in \u201825, \u201826 and \u201827. And that investment really between now and over the next few years is going to help enable that capacity increase in growth as well. So let me just start with a book-to-bill question. Jason, essentially, it's one. Last year, we ended the book -- the backlog at $150 billion. This year, we're planning for that to be around the case maybe it's down $1 billion or up $1 billion. But effectively, a one book-to-bill sets us up for the growth to resume in 2024. So, we don't need to necessarily see the backlog. There is opportunity for it to grow from where we are, and where we landed or ended in 2022. But right now, we're planning for that to be generally flattish and that's where we need to be to drive the growth resumption in 2024. And by breaking it out of the business area, business says structure enables these ideas in these pursuits to really operate at a speed and agility level. It probably wouldn't otherwise be available to them working within the bureaucratic structure that we have in our business areas with the multi -- all the policies and procedures that we have. And so, we give them a little bit more flexibility to operate with some speed. And as Jim mentioned, the ability to pursue co-investment by others as well. You know, it's a good question, Scott. And as I mentioned in my remarks, it's excellent growth from Next Gen Interceptor Classified programs and National Security Space, areas that you would expect. But they also had some growth and I mentioned that there was boosted, protect -- some protected comms programs Orion, fleet ballistic missiles. Those are programs we're expecting to be a little bit more steady state. And so they just were -- they just benefited from some program timing here in the quarter. And just to give you an example, protected comms is up 50% in the quarter. We're expecting that to generally be flat for the year. Orion was up 20% in the quarter. We're expecting that to generally be flat for the year. FBM was up about 20% in the quarter and that was pretty much the full-years' worth of growth all in the first quarter. And so just these things all came together here in the first quarter, that really caused this growth of 16%. We expect this program that I just mentioned to really normalize in the balance of the year. We will continue to see some growth on some of these other programs. I will acknowledge there probably is some upside to their sales, but it's not $1 billion that you're nearly talking anywhere between $100 million to $200 million of probably upside to where we are today. Okay. Let me -- so George, a fair question. Just to -- you may tackle a big question, the big picture question in terms of what happens for the balance of the year. Just on the investment gains, obviously we saw that in the quarter. We talked about that being $0.18 imply, because we're not changing it implies that we're reversing the balance of the year, so we'll see. We'll give that an update in the second quarter, update more halfway through the year and make a call on that. The other element we just were speaking about a little bit in terms of our investment in LM Evolve, we have some of those investments increasing in the balance of the year as well. And then there's just residual corporate costs that we have flowing through. And so all those things are allocated. We'll monitor those throughout the rest of the year and see whether or not. Again, I think we'll just make an assessment halfway through the year on where we are those things to the extent there's upside, we'll make an update at that point in time."

Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.\nJames Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2024 earnings call. The demand for Lockheed Martin systems and services remains robust across all four of our business areas. We ended Q3 with record backlog of more than $165 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3 in the quarter. Precision and Air defense munitions drove the increase, including large orders for Javelin, guided multiple launch rockets and joint air-to-surface standoff and long-range antiship missions. Compared with last year's third quarter, sales increased and segment operating margins expanded 20 points to 10.9%, led by Missiles & Fire Control, reflecting increased production volume. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion in the quarter as we continue to implement working capital efficiencies and optimization. High confidence in our future cash generation prospects supported our Board's recent decision, to raise the quarterly dividend by 5% to $3.30, the 22nd consecutive year of increases and to extend our share repurchase authorization. Turning to the F-35, we delivered 48 F-35 aircraft in the quarter. We expect to deliver 90 to 110 aircraft in 2024 and the remaining balance of the Lot 15 to 17 aircraft thereafter. In addition, TR-3 flight testing continues with 95% of combat capabilities validated and additional capabilities progressing. With over 1,040 aircraft delivered and growing, the F-35 fleet has become an essential component of the collective security of the U.S. and our global allies. For example, by the 2030s, over 600 F-35s will be in operation across more than 10 European nations. And in July, Greece announced that it will be the 19th nation to fly the F-35 and will acquire 20 aircraft. Plus the rollout of the initial F-35 for Poland in August marked a significant milestone in our 20-plus year partnership with that country. The F-35 superior sensors, stealth and data sharing capabilities are setting new standards for interoperability and joint operations with our allies, serving as the cornerstone for NATO's deterrence and defense posture. To further augment the capabilities of the F-35 and our other major platforms, we are investing heavily in autonomy and AI as well as other enabling digital technologies. As an example, our Lockheed Martin AI Center and our RMS business area conducted realistic teaming scenarios with uncrewed aerial systems or drones, and uncrewed ground vehicles at the U.S. Army in their recent experimental demonstration event. The successful demonstrations exhibited our abilities for using AI, by launching an autonomous drone to provide guidance and navigation instructions to a ground-based robot to help it navigate a dangerous urban environment and enable greater safety for our soldiers than any current approaches can do. The rapid integration of digital technologies and capabilities is one element of our 21st Century security strategy. Another example of this, in the third quarter, was Lockheed Martin Skunk Works team partnered with the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School to conduct full-scale live flight tests of an adaptive technology that makes real-time adjustments to flight control algorithms, resulting in substantial time and cost savings. And we do these kind of tech insertions on real, scalable combat platforms. Those that were implemented on mass can have theater-level effects on combat capability and thereby deterrents from great power armed conflict. The second element of 21st Century Security is designing resilience and antifragility into the defense industrial base. To this end, we signed a teaming agreement with our partner, General Dynamics in the third quarter for the production of solid rocket motors. The initial work will focus on producing SRMs for the GMLRS rocket and will start in 2025 at GD's facility in Camden, Arkansas. This third source of solid rocket motors will enable us to move more quickly to ramp production for critical defense capabilities and strengthen the defense supply chain. The third element of 21st Century Security is the implementation of a global and regional approach to production and sustainment with our allies and partners. We have expanded international collaborations to enable indigenous military capability development in countries, including Australia, Germany, Poland and India. I recently had the opportunity to discuss the expansion of Lockheed Martin sustainment and production operations in India with Prime Minister Modi in July, including growing the capacity and the capabilities of our joint ventures with Tata that already manufacture C-130J empennages, F-16 wings and helicopter cabins in Hyderabad. Turning to the U.S. defense budget. We are currently in a continuing resolution that funds U.S. government operations through December 20 of 2024. For our part, our teammates across all of Lockheed Martin will thereby be able to continue to work diligently to deliver on our customer commitments. We'll also be dedicated to delivering strong financial performance through the remaining months of 2024 and to carry that momentum into the coming year as well. So now I'll turn it over to Jay.\nJay Malave: Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide an overview of our consolidated financials and operational highlights in the quarter before handing off to Maria, who will cover business area results, and I'll come back to discuss the 2024 outlook and some longer-term trending. Starting on Chart 4. Sales of $17.1 billion were up 1% year-over-year, led by MFC and RMS. As expected, Aeronautics was down primarily due to delayed revenue recognition of approximately $700 million associated with the lapse in F-35 program funding as we continue to work through Lot 18 negotiations. Normalizing for that impact, consolidated sales would be up 5% year-over-year. Segment operating profit of $1.9 billion was up 3% year-over-year, with consolidated margins at a respectable 10.9%. Net profit adjustments in the quarter were higher than prior year and amounted to 20% of segment operating profit. GAAP earnings per share of $6.80 increased 1% year-over-year, driven by higher profit and lower share count, partially offset by higher interest expense, a higher tax rate and lower pension income. Turning to new business. We recorded over $22 billion of orders in the third quarter, for a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.3, led by MFC with orders exceeding $8 billion and driving overall backlog to over $165 billion. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion in the quarter, aided by strong collections, including international program advances. This brings our year-to-date total free cash flow to just over $4.8 billion, enabling another $700 million of independent research and development and capital expenditures in the quarter. Further enhancing our leadership position in 21st Century Security and integrated deterrence. Finally, we returned $1.7 billion of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Turning to some key operational milestones and program highlights in the quarter. At Aeronautics, through the third quarter, we delivered 48 F-35s. In addition, the team continues to make progress towards Tech Refresh 3 combat capability with incremental milestones on track for completion in the fourth quarter. Beyond the F-35, the C-130 franchise had a very successful quarter. The worldwide fleet of over 550 C-130J Super Hercules surpassed three million flight hours, demonstrating the platform's unmatched global reach and multi-mission versatility. We also delivered the first eight C-130J-30 tactical air lifters to the Ohio Youngstown Air Reserve station in July, and delivered the first J variant aircraft to longtime C-130 customer, New Zealand. At RMS, the U.S. Marine Corps formally accepted the 23rd and final next-generation VH-92A Presidential helicopter built by Sikorsky, marking a significant milestone for the company, whose aircraft have flown every U.S. President since 1957. This is highly tailored solution, based on the proven S-92 helicopter, meets the Marine Corps unique and critical mission of supporting the Commander in Chief around the world. And at Space, in September, NASA awarded Lockheed Martin, a contract to design and build the next-generation Lightning Mapper instruments for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOA, GeoXO program. The baseline contract is valued at approximately $300 million for two instruments with options for an additional two. This award follows on the GeoXO award we received in June to design and build the core NOA spacecraft constellation. This continues our long tradition of designing and building weather and environmental spacecraft, including many earth observation instruments. I'll stop here and hand it over to Maria to talk more about the business area of financials.\nMaria Ricciardone: Thanks, Jay. Today, I'll discuss third quarter year-over-year results for the business areas. Starting with Aeronautics on Chart 5. Third quarter sales at Aero declined 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower F-35 volume due to delays in the Lot 18/19 contract negotiations that Jay previously mentioned. Partially offsetting that headwind with higher volume at C-130 and the continued production ramp on the F-16 program. Segment operating profit decreased 2%, with lower volume and unfavorable mix being partially offset by higher profit booking rate adjustments, mainly due to a favorable adjustment related to a legacy C5 claim. With the F-35 surpassing 1,000 aircraft deliveries this quarter, I'd like to highlight a few other notable items from the other major platforms. More than 2,600 C-130 aircraft have been delivered to 63 nations, with more than 550 J variants delivered to 22 countries and Egypt set to become the 23rd. And the F-16 has delivered more than 4,600 aircraft to 27 countries over the past 50 years. Turning to Missiles & Fire Control on Chart 6. MFC had another solid quarter with sales up 8% year-over-year, driven by production ramps on precision fires programs within the Tactical & Strike Missiles segment, primarily guided multiple launch rocket system, GMLRS and Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, LRASM. Segment operating profit increased 15% year-over-year, due to the higher volume and the higher booking rate profit adjustments primarily at PAC-3, while margins were again solid at 14.4%. MFC's book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was a strong 2.7, leading to another record backlog now over $40 billion, driven by continued global demand. In the quarter, the U.S. Army awarded the largest single year production contract for Javelin and related equipment, worth $1.3 billion to the Javelin joint venture, as well as a $4 billion contract for GMLRS. The Air Force awarded an over $3 billion multiyear large lot procurement contract for JASSM, LRASM, providing a key antifragility measure to increase industry resilience and ensure operations can be ramped more quickly going forward. Shifting to Rotary & Mission Systems on Chart 7. Sales increased 6% in the quarter to $4.4 billion, primarily driven by higher volume at integrated warfare systems and sensors on radar programs, as well as the Canadian Surface Combatant program. Sikorsky programs also saw higher volume led by CH-53K, Blackhawk and Seahawk. Operating profit was comparable to the prior year with higher volumes being offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments. Finally, at Space on Chart 8, sales decreased slightly year-over-year. The reduction was driven by lower volume at commercial civil space, primarily on the Orion program, partially offset by higher volume at strategic and missile defense on our strategic reentry programs. Operating profit increased 5% compared to Q3 2023, driven by favorable mix, partially offset by lower equity earnings from United Launch Alliance, ULA. Recently, Space was awarded a contract to continue nearly 70 years of partnership between the U.S. Navy and Lockheed Martin through the Fleet Ballistic Missile FBM program, a key component of our nation's strategic deterrence. Under the contract, we will provide Trident missile production support and reentry system hardware as well as operations and maintenance to support the readiness and reliability of the missile systems. FBM will continue to be a growth driver for Space for years to come. Now I'll turn it back over to Jay to wrap up our prepared remarks.\nJay Malave: Thanks, Maria. All right. Turning to Chart 9 and our outlook for 2024. With one quarter remaining, we've shifted to approximate point estimates that reflect increased expectations for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We have slightly reduced our share repurchase target for the year to approximately $3.7 billion, primarily due to the redeployment of capital to the Terran Orbital acquisition. All told, we still expect to return greater than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2024 via repurchases and dividends. Quickly stepping through the other metrics, we estimate sales of approximately $71.25 billion, reflecting growth of 5% over 2023 as our backlog continues to convert across the portfolio. We're also increasing the segment operating profit expectation driven by the higher sales volume to approximately $7.475 billion, and we continue to anticipate consolidated segment operating profit margins of approximately 10.5%. Moving to earnings per share. We're increasing our forecast by $0.30 from the prior midpoint to approximately $26.65. Primary drivers of the change are incremental profit of about $0.17, with other below-the-line items and taxes bringing in an additional $0.13. And lastly, on free cash flow. We now estimate approximately $6.2 billion for the year, up slightly from the prior midpoint while absorbing the unfavorable impact of the recent F-35 Lot 15 to 17 aircraft delivery settlement, which we estimate will be approximately $600 million in 2024 with expected recovery over the next few years. Before I talk about trending, I'd like to reiterate a few key assumptions regarding our 2024 outlook. First, we expect F-35 Lot 18-19 to be awarded this year, maintaining program funding and continuity. We continue to make progress in negotiations towards a contract that secures our mutual goals of delivering advanced fifth-generation fighter capability to our services. Should the negotiation time line extend beyond year-end, the financial impact would be one of timing. We could see about 3% or $2 billion of our sales shift into 2025 along with associated impacts to profit and about $1 billion of free cash flow. The second key assumption is that we continue to anticipate $325 million of full-year losses on the MFC classified program. That said, we will continue to assess facts and circumstances that could lead to the recognition of additional losses in the year. And third, this outlook does not assume any pension contribution in 2024. All right. So let's shift now to the outlook beyond 2024, and I'll provide a multiyear framework on Chart 10. To start with, our record backlog position provides a strong foundation for sustained top line growth over the coming years. Looking at sales through the 2027 time line, our baseline assumption still reflects a low-single-digit compound annual growth rate off of the higher-than-expected sales expectation for 2024. As I stated previously, the demand signals point to mid-single-digit growth through 2027, but the outlook remains tempered by our current assessment of the pace at which the value chain can meet the demand. Our confidence in a mid-single-digit growth rate will grow as clarity increases on new business campaigns, funding stability and capacity acceleration of the production systems. On segment margins, we anticipate improvement of 10 to 20 basis points per year based on our continued focus on operational excellence and program performance, combined with program derisking. So in other words, steady improvement to a more normal range of around 11% ROS by 2027. Thinking about EPS trends over the three-year horizon, while we anticipate year-over-year benefits from higher segment operating profit and a lower share count, these benefits will be diluted by continued FAS/CAS pension headwinds, particularly in 2025, and higher effective tax rates from a change in certain deductions based on current law. For free cash flow, we continue to target a low single-digit CAGR through 2027, based on delivering cumulative working capital reductions that partially offset known pension contribution headwinds. While offsetting the pension contributions dollar-for-dollar in each year with working capital reductions alone is a challenge. We have confidence that we could fully offset the headwinds and improve the growth rate to mid-single-digits through the combination of organic and inorganic cash generation initiatives. We'll provide more details in January as we show our plans with better visibility to 2024 pension asset returns, post-election policy and interest rates. Overall, this baseline multiyear framework remains consistent to the investment thesis we've discussed previously. We still expect single digit \u2013 low-single-digit free cash flow growth over the next three years, supplemented by share repurchases to deliver mid-single-digit free cash flow per share return over the same horizon with upside potential. So in summary, on Chart 11. Performance year-to-date gives us confidence to raise the full-year outlook for 2024 and in our ability to deliver solid sales and free cash flow growth over the next few years. At the same time, we continue to invest in digital transformation capabilities and innovative technologies that will help differentiate our mission solutions for customers. And we remain focused on operational execution to deliver on our commitments and long-term value for our customers and shareholders alike. With that, Steve, let's open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session of today's conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Ron Epstein of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRonald Epstein: Yes, thank you. Good morning, Jim and Jay.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning, Ron.\nRonald Epstein: Maybe circling back on some of your prepared comments, Jim. When we think about the current situation in kind of the tactical fighter world, where it seems the Air Force is giving a rethink to NGAD, the system, what it should be. You mentioned some of the work you guys are doing on AI and drones. If you look at how Increment 1 of CCA was awarded to maybe nonusual companies, right, and kind of new players, how are you thinking about Increment 2? And what the interplay between man and unmanned systems, tactical fighters, drones? I mean, does it change how you think about going forward, what NGAD could be and what it means for Lockheed?\nJames Taiclet: Sure, Ron. We're preserving our optionality based on what the U.S. government and service is determined to be their strategy for tactical fighter deployment over the next 20, 30 years. And so part of that strategy is having our Skunk Works continue to develop technologies that could be implemented for a generation, sixth-generation tactile aircraft, it's a step function above what the F-22 and F-35 can do today. So we are investing time, talent and energy into that in Skunk Works which is in this setting, all we can really say about that. The second piece of it, though, is the crewed, uncrewed teaming, element of whether it's NGAD or F-35 plus CCA, if you will, or multiple CCAs. We're already working that out too. We've developed a pod that will enable the F-35 to control even today, CCAs, if you will. And we have a flight control system and communication system and development that will enable that as well. And that could be converted, I think, to F-22 as well. So we are working both of those elements. But the key part of it is you still got to have volume, and I'm an ex-Air Force pilot myself. We have to be able to meet the J-20, which is the Chinese combat tactical aircraft, fifth generation as well, with enough numbers in the Pacific, or at least field enough numbers of -- it's F-35 and F-22 now is the only really competitive jets against the J-20, 1:1. We have to field enough of those aircraft in a short enough time frame to maintain an effective deterrent in the Pacific. And the Russians are also developing fifth-generation aircraft as well. So the threat will emerge in Europe too. So we got to have volume to start with on fifth gen. We need to be able to bring autonomy in the CCA concept into fifth gen and sixth gen, if there is one. So we're keeping all of those avenues open and we're investing really in all three again to preserve the optionality for the defense industrial base and our partners to be able to deliver on which of those strategies or what combination that the U.S. government decides to pursue.\nJay Malave: And I'll just add, Ron, just in our outlook, the multiyear outlook that I gave you, that accounts for and assumes that we'll have incremental -- significantly incremental investment in areas such as autonomy, AI, crewed, uncrewed teaming and manned control systems. So we feel that our investment is going to the right places as these platforms and systems evolve.\nJames Taiclet: Yes. And as far as Increment 2 on the CCA, Ron, the way it's been described to us is Increment 1 was proof-of-concept, more of an experimental kind of approach. Increment 2 is going to be -- targeted to be fieldable combat-ready, scalable design and production of the uncrewed teaming half of the system. So we are fully dedicated to that. Like I said, we have Skunk Works working on both the parent and the child, if you will, when it comes to all CCA concepts and Increment 2 is going to be really where we're, I think, most competitive because we can show that we can control these vehicles with today's technology already at scale. So we're going to be eager to compete for that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Sheila Kahyaoglu of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, Jim and Jay. Jay, maybe one for you. Maybe if we could go to Slide 10. I appreciate you giving the long-term -- medium-term targets for low-single-digit revenue growth. Can you maybe rank order the segment with MFC leading. I think you've talked about mid-single-digit growth of $750 million there. And what other segments follow. What campaigns get you to that mid-single-digit opportunity for top line growth?\nJay Malave: Yes, sure. Thank you, Sheila and good morning. You kind of nailed it in your question. The leader of growth will be MFC over this time period through 2027. And I would put them at the high-single-digit clip very comfortably based on the backlog that they have today and the visibility we have to incremental orders. The other three business areas in this framework, at least starting off with this low-single-digit, the rest of them will be in this low-single-digit framework pretty kind of consistently. Now how do we go from a low-single-digit to a high single-digit? Quite frankly, a lot of that opportunity is already sitting in the backlog. If the system can convert, and I'd say the entire enterprise, so it's not just supply chain, it's our operations as well can convert on that backlog quicker, and we did see this in 2024. If you recall, we came into the year thinking that we would grow low-single-digit, and we converted that and changed it to 5% growth here in 2024. So under the same framework, it is a step change from where we are in 2024, but we demonstrated that we can improve throughout the year. So as that visibility gets better, that would enable us to go from a low-single-digit to mid-single digit. Yes, there are other campaigns and some of those are classified. If you go back a few years, we talked about the four pillars of growth, new awards was an element of that as well as classified growth. New awards, we got one of those, which is the next-generation interceptor. So that's already a win. The other one would be in our -- really our classified portfolio, and those are campaigns that will happen over the next, I would say, six to 18 months. But as I mentioned -- and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the foundation for the growth to mid-single digit is pretty solid. At least in the short term, is more of a conversion issue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hey, good morning everyone.\nJames Taiclet: Good morning.\nNoah Poponak: Jay, I was hoping to get some more help from you on the MFC margin. Do the last two quarters suggest the operating performance is better? Or is it just that the loss accrual is loaded into the fourth quarter? And I guess, remind me why the accounting is that way as opposed to taking it all when you know you have it? And I don't know if you could talk about how you expect that to progress through '25. But I guess just fundamentally\u2026 0 to 31 *** Part 31-end \u2026is that way as opposed to taking it all when you know you have it? And I don't know if you could talk about how you expect that to progress through '25. But I guess just fundamentally, like is the new classified program or the overall operating performance in the segment, is it improving or worsening? Or is it just the volatility is accounting?\nJay Malave: Yes. I would say the volatility is kind of, I would say in this year-to-date, their performance is better than prior year. We've seen an improvement. When you put aside the losses related to the classified program, their profit adjustments year-to-date have shown growth, and they're performing, I think, pretty well in the base. So this was a good quarter, as an example, we didn't really record any losses related to the classified program, and we delivered 14.4% margins in the quarter, and that's essentially where they're operating this year ex the losses. You got it right as far as timing, we would expect, we recorded $100 million in the first quarter. So that would say that about $225 million were record or what's included in our guidance for the fourth quarter. As far as your question on the accounting, it's a good question. It really depends on the facts and circumstances and the probability. We have to make an assessment and a probability of the exercise of certain options. And so the visibility is clear as things are more short term and the visibility gets a little bit more murkier as you go out a little bit further. So you have to make assessments of similar facts such as customer interactions that we have, their intentions, visibility to funding over a longer period of time, the performance of the system is one in how we're doing from a testing perspective. So all of these factors taken together have to go into the assessment to determine if and when we record a forward loss. And so that's where we are. As far as 2025, a baseline assumption would be that we -- you go from $325 million to anywhere between say $250 million to $300 million in losses in 2025, assuming a one per year type of framework. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have to take another look at whether or not there will be additional losses that have to be recognized early on to your question. And again, that's a really quarter-to-quarter assessment that we have to make.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Hey, Jim, just a follow-up first on CCA. Are you currently competing on the autonomy portion of Increment 1? And is that what gives you a better feeling for where Increment 2 Lockheed could be? And then, Jay, could you just update us on the ARRW classified contract? I think you booked another charge in the quarter. I'm just curious if there's any line of sight to when you're sort of back on the right side of that program?\nJames Taiclet: So Myles, based on the classification of the CCA program, especially longer term, I can't refer to it directly as far as who's competing for what element of it. But what I can tell you is, echoing in Jay, we are investing heavily in autonomy, AI, 5G connectivity distributed remote node cloud, those kinds of things that enable a CCA type device to be effective. Now we're testing in open air, I'll call it, these kind of technologies with existing platforms, which is another use case, but it's one we could talk about. So you've already seen potentially that we've got an autonomous Black Hawk up and running full capability helicopter that can do missions with you sitting on your couch in your living room, programming the mission in and changing it in a flight on your iPad, right? This is scalable, big hardware, big effect platforms that can be elevated in their capability with autonomy, AI, et cetera. We've also done the same thing within F-16 with the Air Force that shows that we can actually dog fight an F-16 without a pilot in it and be effective. So these technologies. If you -- one could probably surmise if you can apply them to legacy hardware at that level of scale that you can certainly apply them to hardware that is a smaller scale on crude as well.\nJay Malave: On the question on the classified program at aeronautics we did realize incremental risk in the quarter. In the press release, we had about $80 million there. Year-to-date, we're about $145 million. So we have, obviously, realized some incremental learnings that have converted to incremental losses. It's a classified program, so I can't really talk too much about what it is. But what I can tell you is that we are essentially meeting our scheduled objectives, albeit at a higher cost. And I would say the cost is really a function of the aggressive pricing that we bid originally. And so as we recalibrate, we are kind of keeping an eye on our cost. We'll do continuous reviews, as you would expect us to do. And we'll have another review here in November with the team so we can go back and understand and pressure test the risk management plan. But it's not just an oversight function. I think it's incumbent upon us as a leadership team to not only provide the oversight, but also make sure that we're providing the tools and the resources to make sure they're successful. This program will be managed as a whole team, and we're all in it together. And as I mentioned on the cost, it's -- again, it was bid aggressively. Jim and I have been pretty firm over the past few years that really reining in those practices, and we really haven't seen any of those since that time. And so we've got a contractual commitment that we've got to meet, and we will meet, and we'll manage this program as best as we possibly can. And I think part of what we're trying to do is change the trajectory, drive towards better outcomes, while at the same time deliver the mission capability that we've contracted to give our customer.\nJames Taiclet: And Myles, I can speak to one command and control system that we have demonstrated because it was, again, an open space. Recently, the Air Force put on its [indiscernible] space force put on its sort of annual gathering, if you will, outside of Washington, D.C. And in our -- it's a bit of a trade show set up, so it was public. We were demonstrating to our customers there in open space, again, not classified, our ability to use that iPad technology to control eight CCAs off an F-35 flight control and comm systems. So we've already shown that out in the open. But again, that's technology we've been working on for literally a decade or two at Skunkworks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned of Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDouglas Harned: Good morning. Thank you. On F-35, you said that you expect a lot -- you don't know for sure, but the lot 18 and 19 negotiations hopefully will be completed in Q4, [indiscernible] three are 95% through. What I'm trying to understand are really two things. A lot of times, you can have 5% left on something. We've -- this has been going on a long time getting Tech Refresh three done. How do we get confident that you're going to get there in Q4. And does this have an interplay with the lot 18 and 19 negotiations? Because if I can just ask separately, we're trying to understand what the cash implications are in 2025, if you get all this done or perhaps if it slips?\nJames Taiclet: So Doug, it's Jim. I'll start off. I want to lay out the fundamental framework of the F-35 program. And then I'll turn it over to Jay for some of the cash flow impacts and expectations in the financial results of that. So first of all, just to reiterate, there's a very important distinction between the F-35 production system and how we book revenue and profit on the production system versus the event of final aircraft delivery, which is actually a fairly small proportion of the revenue and profit that an aircraft F-35 aircraft generates for industry, right? So that important distinction. Now there's two current program conditions that you touched on that affect both of these outcomes, right? So what I want to also emphasize is both of the outcomes are not necessarily economic value outcomes. They are timing-related outcomes. So there's a time value money aspect of it, but the economic value of an F-35 that's delivered out of the system is not much affected, if you will, by these two issues, but the timing is effective. So let me just start with TR3 software finalization. So that's one of the conditions that we're managing through with the F-35 program and how that affects the delivery schedule. So about 1.5 years ago, we had conversations, and I did personally about a release one and release two concept. The government calls that truncation, but that's really what the concept is like we would do. And tech or telecom, we're going to do a release one of software. We're going to work through the discovery of that. And then when that is ready, we will be able to have an initial product. And the initial product is TR3 which is capable of doing unit standup, facing operations and training at operating Air Force and Navy and Marine bases as well as our allies with the TR3, I'll call it, again, release on software in it. You can fly the jet, you can practice basic and advanced fighter maneuvers. You can deal with -- develop tactics in your squadron and you can train your maintainers on how to do this new aircraft. So if you're swapping out F-15 Squad and two F-35 Squad and the maintainers actually need to get their hands on the planes just as much as the pilots do. And then make sure all the tooling and everything is working for them. So Release 1 is what's being delivered now. That was the 48 in the third quarter. They all have Release 1, you can fly the jet. What it doesn't have are some of those incremental software validations that show that all combat systems and all weapons will be able to be effectively deployed because the testing program in flight test and bench test has been completed and we get a certification of reliability for that weapon, for example. There are a lot of test points there. And those test points are going to be developed, not just in the fourth quarter, but they're going to be developed over the course of 2025 as well, because when I say a weapon, is it an [indiscernible] is it an A9, what weapon are we talking about? There's literally dozens of weapons and there are multiple test points on things like the distributing after system, et cetera. So this is a complex path to what I'll call Release that's the full up combat capability. And as we work through those capability certifications individually, they'll be diminishing cat withholds along the way as those flight tests are completed and the certifications happen. Jay can kind of aggregate that for you in a minute. But that's how this part of the program works on a fundamental basis. So we feel that our projection of in 2024, 90 to 110 deliveries out of that process and to Release 1. In 2025 and beyond 180 deliveries a year of F-35. Now those are going to be a mix of those coming off the line, brand new and those that are parked. So the 180s will be a mix of those. We're working on a weekly basis right now to prioritize specific aircraft deliveries, literally one at a time. There's one go to the Dutch Air Force first and the marine second. And whenever we reprioritize what we're doing by the week based on the needs of the customer base, we need to change bill of materials. We'll do other things and parked aircraft may remain when a new aircraft may come right out to the fleet. So the complexity of this TR3 software definitization and release is going to take some time, but we will be able to deliver a mix of aircraft above the 156 production rate for the next few years because we'll be mixing based on what the customer is looking for. So that's one of the issues that you talked about. The other issue is actually, I would consider it completely unrelated from this. And that issue is any lot negotiation for a program such as this and at the scale that this program is at. So we are on a lot of contractual negotiation with the U.S. government. And by we, I mean, our major suppliers with us and all the way down to our smaller suppliers. Now currently, that lot negotiation is '18 and '19, and it's not completed yet. And under the federal acquisition regulation, if the government does not have a formal agreement with the supplier completed, the government cannot pay for either work being done under that undefinitized contract. In fact, it's not completed contract to be clear. Or pay for a product that is actually completed either. So that is where we as an industry then have to prioritize keeping our production system on pace, while the government by law, cannot pay us. So it's essential for the health of the lower-tier suppliers that we do that. We all kind of step up and do it as an industry. But the prime and major subs cannot book our revenue and profit even though we're expending cost. And that's where the cash impact of the negotiation comes in. We're not going to stop the production line because it would be unwise, I'll say, until the formal agreement is signed, we are going to keep it going until the formal agreement is signed, at which time these cash payments will be releasable. So those are the two issues we're facing. I want to say one of the things Doug -- why you've asked about this top of F-35. This isn't just a Lockheed Martin commitment to make this program a success. It's an industry-wide commitment, and I would also add a government commitment to make it a success. I'll just give you a few of the things that we've been part of and led over the last, I'd say two, three months. We held a CEO Summit of the top five industry partners in Fort Worth at the factory where we took an entire day determining how we could integrate our systems, IT systems, test systems, our processes, how we develop subassemblies and other items that go on the jet and integrate them with the jet those processes and personnel, moving more people between companies on either a temporary or almost semipermanent basis to make sure we've got the best talent working on every problem. So that's one thing that we've done. That same CEO level team followed up with the government and the meeting there was chaired by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the joint program office leader was their General Schmidt, the U.S. Navy and Marines had their air bosses there and that was in the Pentagon to lay out a similar integration framework with U.S. government systems, processes and personnel that's appropriate under law and regulation. And then we add another CEO update with U.S. senior government officials and this was just two weeks ago and seven partner nation customer officials in Washington to trade status of what we were all doing together. And in two more weeks, I'm bringing my executive team at Lockheed Martin across all the businesses and functions. We're going to gather in Fort Worth to make sure that every resource, every operational practice, every supply chain element that we can bring from across the company and certainly all the technical talent is devoted to this program. That is what we are doing to make sure this is a success. And the last thing I'll say there is that the customers need and want this aircraft. That was the opinion of the U.S. government in our meeting with the chief. There are six customers since 2020. I think these are all the competitions that we're in actually that chose the F-35 that weren't in the original partner group or the original order team. Switzerland, Finland, Germany, Canada, the Czech Republic and Greece. And then follow-ons from partners that already have the aircraft in operation also were added Japan, Netherlands, Republican Korea and Israel. So the demand for the aircraft and actually essential need for the aircraft is there. Industry is getting together with the government, and I think in ways that we haven't done before to really make this a success. And we've got to work our way through the lot negotiation, which is, again, it's a timing issue as far as payments, and we got to work our way through TR3 integration, which is a technical issue. But literally, it's an all hands on deck, not just an industry, but I'd say in government to get this all done. Jay, any...\nJay Malave: Yes. Let me just add to -- Doug, I'll try to give you a little bit of color on the cash impact to your question. As Jim mentioned, what we're looking at here is an output estimate of about 180 aircraft deliveries per year over the next three plus years. So effectively, what will happen is cash collections will smooth out over this period of time. This is important to point out that, that remains consistent with the low single-digit free cash flow growth framework that we've articulated today and previously. Just maybe a little bit on 2024. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we estimated the impact this year of unfavorable impact of about $600 million. That consists of two factors. Number one, less deliveries than the 156 rate. So we'll deliver in that range of 100 aircraft or so. So there's going to be less aircraft delivered and so there's an impact for cash flow from that. The second impact is the impact of the withholds. While we will release some of those with holds this year based on completion of milestones, there will still be some that carry over into next year and a little bit into 2026. Now in 2024, that's unfavorable impact was $600 million, that was entirely offset by other working capital efficiencies in the rest of the portfolio of about $600 million, mostly through advances that we've seen there. And so the net impact and then what enabled us to deliver the same free cash flow and, in fact, better than the midpoint that we had originally guided to was that offset. As you go to 2025, will deliver more aircraft. And so we will see the benefit of having delivered more aircraft and we will also see the benefit of having incremental withholds released. I would quantify that today at around $300 million to $400 million. And then that will then continue to flow in 2016 and beyond. And hopefully, that helps.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rich Safran of Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nRichard Safran: Jay, on your opening remarks on pension, I think in the past, you made some comments about possibly reducing some out-year pension headwinds. So I want to know if you could maybe update us on what your thinking is there, if you still intend to reduce the headwinds after 2025 using debt or cash? And if so, what the timing of that might be?\nJay Malave: Yes. Thanks, Rich. Essentially, in my prepared remarks, I talked about the inorganic and organic means of managing this pension headwind. The inorganic would essentially be the issuance of debt as a primary enabler to be able to do that. That's still on the table. As I said on my prepared remarks that we're going to go through between here and the end of the year and finalize our plans based on various factors. And as you would expect, we're trying to exhaust all of the opportunities on an organic basis. So what can we bring out in working capital over this period of time to be able to offset as much as possible. To the extent that we can't, we do have the ability to go on financing to take out. I think the key takeaway there is that I remain confident that we'll be able to do that through the combination of organic working capital reduction as well as some level of inorganic mostly on the debt side.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of David Strauss of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nDavid Strauss: Just wanted to clarify on the longer-term framework relative to what you had said previously on 2025. I think you had talked about a 2025 growth in line with 2024, which is at 5%. So is that still the case or not? I know this is out through 2027. If you could just touch on that. And then Maybe, Jim, if you could touch on progress on the solar rocket motor side of things in terms of how that's going? Obviously, you announced this partnership with General Dynamics during the quarter as well. Thanks.\nJay Malave: Just on the framework as it relates to 2025. 2025 is very consistent with the multi-year framework that's on that chart, which is our starting point here is a low single-digit growth framework off of the 2024 number. And again, it's -- we're looking at MFC being the driver there, kind of starting off at a high single-digit rate. And the other business areas being either flat, slightly flat or on the up in this low-single digits. And so that's really our starting point. Again, we'll give a lot more color in January as we finalize these plans. But I'd say '25 is consistent with what we're saying in the multi-year framework. I guess just a reminder, David, I think it applies to '25 as it does in the three year framework. When you went to '24, we started at low-single digit. We upgraded it to mid-single digit. I think as our visibility improves, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's still the case where we could be mid-single digits in 2025, but we need to see it come through. We need to see the production and operating systems be able to consistently grow at a mid-single digit CAGR, which is a lot easier said than done in the environment that we've been living under over the past few years.\nJames Taiclet: And David, as far as the solid rocket motor industrial base, I think this is a really positive example of how industry does come together in the service of national security, right? So first of all, I've just circulating this question with our Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, who's outstanding on Northrop Grumman and Aerojet Rocketdyne, which is now managed by L3 Harris. My question to Frank is, are these companies putting all the resources that we think they could be putting into their solid rocket motor operations, quality, delivery schedule, personnel, et cetera and open to us collaborating with them to make sure those deliveries happen? And his answer to me was yes. So our industry -- existing industry partners are stepping up to try to meet the elevated demand and investing to do that. So that's great. But we still need a third source from, I think, an antifragility perspective as we call it. And that is a partnership with General Dynamics, and that started off at the CEO level, and we figured out there was complementary capabilities between General Dynamics and Lockheed Martin, where we could actually have the design done at Lockheed Martin for the SRM and the General Dynamics had the ability, the facilities and the kind of production operations and personnel that could actually produce it. And so we are working together on that. We'll have to get that new solid rocket motor certified. It will be, again, Lockheed Martin IP design, if you will, and General Dynamics is standing up simultaneously the ability to produce them at rate. We have to do a few test articles next year in 2025. There'll be further testing that's done by the services to get their certification, the military services in 2026 and should be producing at rate we hope by 2027. And that will add a third supplier for the national defense industrial base, not just for Lockheed Martin, but for others as well and really strengthen our ability to produce these systems.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky of Citi. Please go ahead.\nJason Gursky: Hey, good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking the question.\nJay Malave: Good morning.\nJason Gursky: Jay, I just want to really, really pound the table -- not pound the table [indiscernible] horse here, I should say. And make sure I fully, fully understand the multi-year outlook here. So what you're saying is low-single digits as the baseline you can outperform that into the mid-single digits. So long as the supply chain and the production system kind of maybe performs as well as it did this year relative to expectations. What's the blue sky scenario here? Let's say that the supply chain all steps back into place, the production system is working well. You are then in this context, producing mid-single digit growth. But I would imagine that you've got a pipeline of additional opportunities out there. Is there a blue sky scenario where you're actually doing better than mid-single digit?\nJay Malave: It's a great question, Jason. Let me just first say terms in the framework. I mean, obviously, over 2025, there's better visibility than there would be for 2027. So the outlook feels good. And so my comment in terms of confidence as far as the demand signal being able to drive to a mid-single digit growth rate in '25 is heightened by better visibility. If you think about what we've seen in over, and I'll take '24 as an example in answer to your question, given what we've seen the demand cycle would have also enabled a higher growth rate than 5% in 2024. So I think the answer to your question in the short term is yes. I don't know that I could sit there and say that a multi-year framework would be a high-single digit number. But I think that given all the right circumstances, you could definitely see a year that could deliver high-single digit. But again, we're starting from low, we got to get to mid, we get to mid and then we can talk about anything beyond that. First things first.\nOperator: Our next question will come from the line of Rob Stallard of Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Stallard: Thanks very much. Good morning.\nJay Malave: Good morning.\nRob Stallard: Jay, a question on the cash situation. Can you give us an idea of just how much working capital benefit you have to get through in the next couple of years to offset pension? And just how risky is this prediction?\nJay Malave: Well, Rob, the way I would characterize it is just quick math, one day equates to about $200 million of free cash flow. And I would say through '25 and '26, we would have to do at least two days of working capital improvement. So is it possible? Yes, in both years, so you'd have to do cumulatively four days through '25 and '26. It's possible, but it's a stretch. And that's why I believe kind of a better, higher confidence plan would be to combine the initiatives on working capital with some of potential inorganic capabilities or cash generation with the ability to really draw that back down over a period of time with continued cash flow growth. And so I think it's -- what I would say next year is that we've probably got two days that are not yet solution between now and the end of the year that we got to go figure out. And to the extent that we can and that relates to 2025, will that be -- the inorganic becomes the gap filler.\nMaria Ricciardone: All right. Steve, this is Maria. I think we've come to the top of the hour. So I'll turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\nJames Taiclet: Sure. Thanks, Maria. Look, I just want to recognize the employees across Lockheed Martin, their dedication, their resilience and they consistently are innovating now in ways I think we never have and cooperated across businesses and functions before like we never have. So I want to really make sure that they're recognized this afternoon. We want to make sure that our allies in our country can defend itself and therefore, deter any aggression against us, and that's what they think they're doing and what they are doing every day. So I want to thank them and thank you for joining us all. I look forward to connecting you again for our Q4 call in January. So we'll see you then. Steve, that concludes the call for today. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference call for today. On behalf of today's conference call. We'd like to thank you for your participation, and thank you for using AT&T. Have a wonderful day. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "James Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our third quarter 2024 earnings call. The demand for Lockheed Martin systems and services remains robust across all four of our business areas. We ended Q3 with record backlog of more than $165 billion, reflecting a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3 in the quarter. Precision and Air defense munitions drove the increase, including large orders for Javelin, guided multiple launch rockets and joint air-to-surface standoff and long-range antiship missions. Compared with last year's third quarter, sales increased and segment operating margins expanded 20 points to 10.9%, led by Missiles & Fire Control, reflecting increased production volume. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion in the quarter as we continue to implement working capital efficiencies and optimization. High confidence in our future cash generation prospects supported our Board's recent decision, to raise the quarterly dividend by 5% to $3.30, the 22nd consecutive year of increases and to extend our share repurchase authorization. Turning to the F-35, we delivered 48 F-35 aircraft in the quarter. We expect to deliver 90 to 110 aircraft in 2024 and the remaining balance of the Lot 15 to 17 aircraft thereafter. In addition, TR-3 flight testing continues with 95% of combat capabilities validated and additional capabilities progressing. With over 1,040 aircraft delivered and growing, the F-35 fleet has become an essential component of the collective security of the U.S. and our global allies. For example, by the 2030s, over 600 F-35s will be in operation across more than 10 European nations. And in July, Greece announced that it will be the 19th nation to fly the F-35 and will acquire 20 aircraft. Plus the rollout of the initial F-35 for Poland in August marked a significant milestone in our 20-plus year partnership with that country. The F-35 superior sensors, stealth and data sharing capabilities are setting new standards for interoperability and joint operations with our allies, serving as the cornerstone for NATO's deterrence and defense posture. To further augment the capabilities of the F-35 and our other major platforms, we are investing heavily in autonomy and AI as well as other enabling digital technologies. As an example, our Lockheed Martin AI Center and our RMS business area conducted realistic teaming scenarios with uncrewed aerial systems or drones, and uncrewed ground vehicles at the U.S. Army in their recent experimental demonstration event. The successful demonstrations exhibited our abilities for using AI, by launching an autonomous drone to provide guidance and navigation instructions to a ground-based robot to help it navigate a dangerous urban environment and enable greater safety for our soldiers than any current approaches can do. The rapid integration of digital technologies and capabilities is one element of our 21st Century security strategy. Another example of this, in the third quarter, was Lockheed Martin Skunk Works team partnered with the U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School to conduct full-scale live flight tests of an adaptive technology that makes real-time adjustments to flight control algorithms, resulting in substantial time and cost savings. And we do these kind of tech insertions on real, scalable combat platforms. Those that were implemented on mass can have theater-level effects on combat capability and thereby deterrents from great power armed conflict. The second element of 21st Century Security is designing resilience and antifragility into the defense industrial base. To this end, we signed a teaming agreement with our partner, General Dynamics in the third quarter for the production of solid rocket motors. The initial work will focus on producing SRMs for the GMLRS rocket and will start in 2025 at GD's facility in Camden, Arkansas. This third source of solid rocket motors will enable us to move more quickly to ramp production for critical defense capabilities and strengthen the defense supply chain. The third element of 21st Century Security is the implementation of a global and regional approach to production and sustainment with our allies and partners. We have expanded international collaborations to enable indigenous military capability development in countries, including Australia, Germany, Poland and India. I recently had the opportunity to discuss the expansion of Lockheed Martin sustainment and production operations in India with Prime Minister Modi in July, including growing the capacity and the capabilities of our joint ventures with Tata that already manufacture C-130J empennages, F-16 wings and helicopter cabins in Hyderabad. Turning to the U.S. defense budget. We are currently in a continuing resolution that funds U.S. government operations through December 20 of 2024. For our part, our teammates across all of Lockheed Martin will thereby be able to continue to work diligently to deliver on our customer commitments. We'll also be dedicated to delivering strong financial performance through the remaining months of 2024 and to carry that momentum into the coming year as well. So now I'll turn it over to Jay. Good morning, Ron. Sure, Ron. We're preserving our optionality based on what the U.S. government and service is determined to be their strategy for tactical fighter deployment over the next 20, 30 years. And so part of that strategy is having our Skunk Works continue to develop technologies that could be implemented for a generation, sixth-generation tactile aircraft, it's a step function above what the F-22 and F-35 can do today. So we are investing time, talent and energy into that in Skunk Works which is in this setting, all we can really say about that. The second piece of it, though, is the crewed, uncrewed teaming, element of whether it's NGAD or F-35 plus CCA, if you will, or multiple CCAs. We're already working that out too. We've developed a pod that will enable the F-35 to control even today, CCAs, if you will. And we have a flight control system and communication system and development that will enable that as well. And that could be converted, I think, to F-22 as well. So we are working both of those elements. But the key part of it is you still got to have volume, and I'm an ex-Air Force pilot myself. We have to be able to meet the J-20, which is the Chinese combat tactical aircraft, fifth generation as well, with enough numbers in the Pacific, or at least field enough numbers of -- it's F-35 and F-22 now is the only really competitive jets against the J-20, 1:1. We have to field enough of those aircraft in a short enough time frame to maintain an effective deterrent in the Pacific. And the Russians are also developing fifth-generation aircraft as well. So the threat will emerge in Europe too. So we got to have volume to start with on fifth gen. We need to be able to bring autonomy in the CCA concept into fifth gen and sixth gen, if there is one. So we're keeping all of those avenues open and we're investing really in all three again to preserve the optionality for the defense industrial base and our partners to be able to deliver on which of those strategies or what combination that the U.S. government decides to pursue. Yes. And as far as Increment 2 on the CCA, Ron, the way it's been described to us is Increment 1 was proof-of-concept, more of an experimental kind of approach. Increment 2 is going to be -- targeted to be fieldable combat-ready, scalable design and production of the uncrewed teaming half of the system. So we are fully dedicated to that. Like I said, we have Skunk Works working on both the parent and the child, if you will, when it comes to all CCA concepts and Increment 2 is going to be really where we're, I think, most competitive because we can show that we can control these vehicles with today's technology already at scale. So we're going to be eager to compete for that. Good morning. So Myles, based on the classification of the CCA program, especially longer term, I can't refer to it directly as far as who's competing for what element of it. But what I can tell you is, echoing in Jay, we are investing heavily in autonomy, AI, 5G connectivity distributed remote node cloud, those kinds of things that enable a CCA type device to be effective. Now we're testing in open air, I'll call it, these kind of technologies with existing platforms, which is another use case, but it's one we could talk about. So you've already seen potentially that we've got an autonomous Black Hawk up and running full capability helicopter that can do missions with you sitting on your couch in your living room, programming the mission in and changing it in a flight on your iPad, right? This is scalable, big hardware, big effect platforms that can be elevated in their capability with autonomy, AI, et cetera. We've also done the same thing within F-16 with the Air Force that shows that we can actually dog fight an F-16 without a pilot in it and be effective. So these technologies. If you -- one could probably surmise if you can apply them to legacy hardware at that level of scale that you can certainly apply them to hardware that is a smaller scale on crude as well. And Myles, I can speak to one command and control system that we have demonstrated because it was, again, an open space. Recently, the Air Force put on its [indiscernible] space force put on its sort of annual gathering, if you will, outside of Washington, D.C. And in our -- it's a bit of a trade show set up, so it was public. We were demonstrating to our customers there in open space, again, not classified, our ability to use that iPad technology to control eight CCAs off an F-35 flight control and comm systems. So we've already shown that out in the open. But again, that's technology we've been working on for literally a decade or two at Skunkworks. So Doug, it's Jim. I'll start off. I want to lay out the fundamental framework of the F-35 program. And then I'll turn it over to Jay for some of the cash flow impacts and expectations in the financial results of that. So first of all, just to reiterate, there's a very important distinction between the F-35 production system and how we book revenue and profit on the production system versus the event of final aircraft delivery, which is actually a fairly small proportion of the revenue and profit that an aircraft F-35 aircraft generates for industry, right? So that important distinction. Now there's two current program conditions that you touched on that affect both of these outcomes, right? So what I want to also emphasize is both of the outcomes are not necessarily economic value outcomes. They are timing-related outcomes. So there's a time value money aspect of it, but the economic value of an F-35 that's delivered out of the system is not much affected, if you will, by these two issues, but the timing is effective. So let me just start with TR3 software finalization. So that's one of the conditions that we're managing through with the F-35 program and how that affects the delivery schedule. So about 1.5 years ago, we had conversations, and I did personally about a release one and release two concept. The government calls that truncation, but that's really what the concept is like we would do. And tech or telecom, we're going to do a release one of software. We're going to work through the discovery of that. And then when that is ready, we will be able to have an initial product. And the initial product is TR3 which is capable of doing unit standup, facing operations and training at operating Air Force and Navy and Marine bases as well as our allies with the TR3, I'll call it, again, release on software in it. You can fly the jet, you can practice basic and advanced fighter maneuvers. You can deal with -- develop tactics in your squadron and you can train your maintainers on how to do this new aircraft. So if you're swapping out F-15 Squad and two F-35 Squad and the maintainers actually need to get their hands on the planes just as much as the pilots do. And then make sure all the tooling and everything is working for them. So Release 1 is what's being delivered now. That was the 48 in the third quarter. They all have Release 1, you can fly the jet. What it doesn't have are some of those incremental software validations that show that all combat systems and all weapons will be able to be effectively deployed because the testing program in flight test and bench test has been completed and we get a certification of reliability for that weapon, for example. There are a lot of test points there. And those test points are going to be developed, not just in the fourth quarter, but they're going to be developed over the course of 2025 as well, because when I say a weapon, is it an [indiscernible] is it an A9, what weapon are we talking about? There's literally dozens of weapons and there are multiple test points on things like the distributing after system, et cetera. So this is a complex path to what I'll call Release that's the full up combat capability. And as we work through those capability certifications individually, they'll be diminishing cat withholds along the way as those flight tests are completed and the certifications happen. Jay can kind of aggregate that for you in a minute. But that's how this part of the program works on a fundamental basis. So we feel that our projection of in 2024, 90 to 110 deliveries out of that process and to Release 1. In 2025 and beyond 180 deliveries a year of F-35. Now those are going to be a mix of those coming off the line, brand new and those that are parked. So the 180s will be a mix of those. We're working on a weekly basis right now to prioritize specific aircraft deliveries, literally one at a time. There's one go to the Dutch Air Force first and the marine second. And whenever we reprioritize what we're doing by the week based on the needs of the customer base, we need to change bill of materials. We'll do other things and parked aircraft may remain when a new aircraft may come right out to the fleet. So the complexity of this TR3 software definitization and release is going to take some time, but we will be able to deliver a mix of aircraft above the 156 production rate for the next few years because we'll be mixing based on what the customer is looking for. So that's one of the issues that you talked about. The other issue is actually, I would consider it completely unrelated from this. And that issue is any lot negotiation for a program such as this and at the scale that this program is at. So we are on a lot of contractual negotiation with the U.S. government. And by we, I mean, our major suppliers with us and all the way down to our smaller suppliers. Now currently, that lot negotiation is '18 and '19, and it's not completed yet. And under the federal acquisition regulation, if the government does not have a formal agreement with the supplier completed, the government cannot pay for either work being done under that undefinitized contract. In fact, it's not completed contract to be clear. Or pay for a product that is actually completed either. So that is where we as an industry then have to prioritize keeping our production system on pace, while the government by law, cannot pay us. So it's essential for the health of the lower-tier suppliers that we do that. We all kind of step up and do it as an industry. But the prime and major subs cannot book our revenue and profit even though we're expending cost. And that's where the cash impact of the negotiation comes in. We're not going to stop the production line because it would be unwise, I'll say, until the formal agreement is signed, we are going to keep it going until the formal agreement is signed, at which time these cash payments will be releasable. So those are the two issues we're facing. I want to say one of the things Doug -- why you've asked about this top of F-35. This isn't just a Lockheed Martin commitment to make this program a success. It's an industry-wide commitment, and I would also add a government commitment to make it a success. I'll just give you a few of the things that we've been part of and led over the last, I'd say two, three months. We held a CEO Summit of the top five industry partners in Fort Worth at the factory where we took an entire day determining how we could integrate our systems, IT systems, test systems, our processes, how we develop subassemblies and other items that go on the jet and integrate them with the jet those processes and personnel, moving more people between companies on either a temporary or almost semipermanent basis to make sure we've got the best talent working on every problem. So that's one thing that we've done. That same CEO level team followed up with the government and the meeting there was chaired by the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, the joint program office leader was their General Schmidt, the U.S. Navy and Marines had their air bosses there and that was in the Pentagon to lay out a similar integration framework with U.S. government systems, processes and personnel that's appropriate under law and regulation. And then we add another CEO update with U.S. senior government officials and this was just two weeks ago and seven partner nation customer officials in Washington to trade status of what we were all doing together. And in two more weeks, I'm bringing my executive team at Lockheed Martin across all the businesses and functions. We're going to gather in Fort Worth to make sure that every resource, every operational practice, every supply chain element that we can bring from across the company and certainly all the technical talent is devoted to this program. That is what we are doing to make sure this is a success. And the last thing I'll say there is that the customers need and want this aircraft. That was the opinion of the U.S. government in our meeting with the chief. There are six customers since 2020. I think these are all the competitions that we're in actually that chose the F-35 that weren't in the original partner group or the original order team. Switzerland, Finland, Germany, Canada, the Czech Republic and Greece. And then follow-ons from partners that already have the aircraft in operation also were added Japan, Netherlands, Republican Korea and Israel. So the demand for the aircraft and actually essential need for the aircraft is there. Industry is getting together with the government, and I think in ways that we haven't done before to really make this a success. And we've got to work our way through the lot negotiation, which is, again, it's a timing issue as far as payments, and we got to work our way through TR3 integration, which is a technical issue. But literally, it's an all hands on deck, not just an industry, but I'd say in government to get this all done. Jay, any... And David, as far as the solid rocket motor industrial base, I think this is a really positive example of how industry does come together in the service of national security, right? So first of all, I've just circulating this question with our Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, who's outstanding on Northrop Grumman and Aerojet Rocketdyne, which is now managed by L3 Harris. My question to Frank is, are these companies putting all the resources that we think they could be putting into their solid rocket motor operations, quality, delivery schedule, personnel, et cetera and open to us collaborating with them to make sure those deliveries happen? And his answer to me was yes. So our industry -- existing industry partners are stepping up to try to meet the elevated demand and investing to do that. So that's great. But we still need a third source from, I think, an antifragility perspective as we call it.

And that will add a third supplier for the national defense industrial base, not just for Lockheed Martin, but for others as well and really strengthen our ability to produce these systems. Sure. Thanks, Maria. Look, I just want to recognize the employees across Lockheed Martin, their dedication, their resilience and they consistently are innovating now in ways I think we never have and cooperated across businesses and functions before like we never have. So I want to really make sure that they're recognized this afternoon. We want to make sure that our allies in our country can defend itself and therefore, deter any aggression against us, and that's what they think they're doing and what they are doing every day. So I want to thank them and thank you for joining us all. I look forward to connecting you again for our Q4 call in January. So we'll see you then. Steve, that concludes the call for today. Thanks, everybody."

            "content": "Thanks, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Today, I'll provide an overview of our consolidated financials and operational highlights in the quarter before handing off to Maria, who will cover business area results, and I'll come back to discuss the 2024 outlook and some longer-term trending. Starting on Chart 4. Sales of $17.1 billion were up 1% year-over-year, led by MFC and RMS. As expected, Aeronautics was down primarily due to delayed revenue recognition of approximately $700 million associated with the lapse in F-35 program funding as we continue to work through Lot 18 negotiations. Normalizing for that impact, consolidated sales would be up 5% year-over-year. Segment operating profit of $1.9 billion was up 3% year-over-year, with consolidated margins at a respectable 10.9%. Net profit adjustments in the quarter were higher than prior year and amounted to 20% of segment operating profit. GAAP earnings per share of $6.80 increased 1% year-over-year, driven by higher profit and lower share count, partially offset by higher interest expense, a higher tax rate and lower pension income. Turning to new business. We recorded over $22 billion of orders in the third quarter, for a book-to-bill ratio of approximately 1.3, led by MFC with orders exceeding $8 billion and driving overall backlog to over $165 billion. Free cash flow was $2.1 billion in the quarter, aided by strong collections, including international program advances. This brings our year-to-date total free cash flow to just over $4.8 billion, enabling another $700 million of independent research and development and capital expenditures in the quarter. Further enhancing our leadership position in 21st Century Security and integrated deterrence. Finally, we returned $1.7 billion of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Turning to some key operational milestones and program highlights in the quarter. At Aeronautics, through the third quarter, we delivered 48 F-35s. In addition, the team continues to make progress towards Tech Refresh 3 combat capability with incremental milestones on track for completion in the fourth quarter. Beyond the F-35, the C-130 franchise had a very successful quarter. The worldwide fleet of over 550 C-130J Super Hercules surpassed three million flight hours, demonstrating the platform's unmatched global reach and multi-mission versatility. We also delivered the first eight C-130J-30 tactical air lifters to the Ohio Youngstown Air Reserve station in July, and delivered the first J variant aircraft to longtime C-130 customer, New Zealand. At RMS, the U.S. Marine Corps formally accepted the 23rd and final next-generation VH-92A Presidential helicopter built by Sikorsky, marking a significant milestone for the company, whose aircraft have flown every U.S. President since 1957. This is highly tailored solution, based on the proven S-92 helicopter, meets the Marine Corps unique and critical mission of supporting the Commander in Chief around the world. And at Space, in September, NASA awarded Lockheed Martin, a contract to design and build the next-generation Lightning Mapper instruments for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or NOA, GeoXO program. The baseline contract is valued at approximately $300 million for two instruments with options for an additional two. This award follows on the GeoXO award we received in June to design and build the core NOA spacecraft constellation. This continues our long tradition of designing and building weather and environmental spacecraft, including many earth observation instruments. I'll stop here and hand it over to Maria to talk more about the business area of financials. Thanks, Maria. All right. Turning to Chart 9 and our outlook for 2024. With one quarter remaining, we've shifted to approximate point estimates that reflect increased expectations for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and free cash flow. We have slightly reduced our share repurchase target for the year to approximately $3.7 billion, primarily due to the redeployment of capital to the Terran Orbital acquisition. All told, we still expect to return greater than 100% of free cash flow to shareholders in 2024 via repurchases and dividends. Quickly stepping through the other metrics, we estimate sales of approximately $71.25 billion, reflecting growth of 5% over 2023 as our backlog continues to convert across the portfolio. We're also increasing the segment operating profit expectation driven by the higher sales volume to approximately $7.475 billion, and we continue to anticipate consolidated segment operating profit margins of approximately 10.5%. Moving to earnings per share. We're increasing our forecast by $0.30 from the prior midpoint to approximately $26.65. Primary drivers of the change are incremental profit of about $0.17, with other below-the-line items and taxes bringing in an additional $0.13. And lastly, on free cash flow. We now estimate approximately $6.2 billion for the year, up slightly from the prior midpoint while absorbing the unfavorable impact of the recent F-35 Lot 15 to 17 aircraft delivery settlement, which we estimate will be approximately $600 million in 2024 with expected recovery over the next few years. Before I talk about trending, I'd like to reiterate a few key assumptions regarding our 2024 outlook. First, we expect F-35 Lot 18-19 to be awarded this year, maintaining program funding and continuity. We continue to make progress in negotiations towards a contract that secures our mutual goals of delivering advanced fifth-generation fighter capability to our services. Should the negotiation time line extend beyond year-end, the financial impact would be one of timing. We could see about 3% or $2 billion of our sales shift into 2025 along with associated impacts to profit and about $1 billion of free cash flow. The second key assumption is that we continue to anticipate $325 million of full-year losses on the MFC classified program. That said, we will continue to assess facts and circumstances that could lead to the recognition of additional losses in the year. And third, this outlook does not assume any pension contribution in 2024. All right. So let's shift now to the outlook beyond 2024, and I'll provide a multiyear framework on Chart 10. To start with, our record backlog position provides a strong foundation for sustained top line growth over the coming years. Looking at sales through the 2027 time line, our baseline assumption still reflects a low-single-digit compound annual growth rate off of the higher-than-expected sales expectation for 2024. As I stated previously, the demand signals point to mid-single-digit growth through 2027, but the outlook remains tempered by our current assessment of the pace at which the value chain can meet the demand. Our confidence in a mid-single-digit growth rate will grow as clarity increases on new business campaigns, funding stability and capacity acceleration of the production systems. On segment margins, we anticipate improvement of 10 to 20 basis points per year based on our continued focus on operational excellence and program performance, combined with program derisking. So in other words, steady improvement to a more normal range of around 11% ROS by 2027. Thinking about EPS trends over the three-year horizon, while we anticipate year-over-year benefits from higher segment operating profit and a lower share count, these benefits will be diluted by continued FAS/CAS pension headwinds, particularly in 2025, and higher effective tax rates from a change in certain deductions based on current law. For free cash flow, we continue to target a low single-digit CAGR through 2027, based on delivering cumulative working capital reductions that partially offset known pension contribution headwinds. While offsetting the pension contributions dollar-for-dollar in each year with working capital reductions alone is a challenge. We have confidence that we could fully offset the headwinds and improve the growth rate to mid-single-digits through the combination of organic and inorganic cash generation initiatives. We'll provide more details in January as we show our plans with better visibility to 2024 pension asset returns, post-election policy and interest rates. Overall, this baseline multiyear framework remains consistent to the investment thesis we've discussed previously. We still expect single digit \u2013 low-single-digit free cash flow growth over the next three years, supplemented by share repurchases to deliver mid-single-digit free cash flow per share return over the same horizon with upside potential. So in summary, on Chart 11. Performance year-to-date gives us confidence to raise the full-year outlook for 2024 and in our ability to deliver solid sales and free cash flow growth over the next few years. At the same time, we continue to invest in digital transformation capabilities and innovative technologies that will help differentiate our mission solutions for customers. And we remain focused on operational execution to deliver on our commitments and long-term value for our customers and shareholders alike. With that, Steve, let's open up the call for Q&A. And I'll just add, Ron, just in our outlook, the multiyear outlook that I gave you, that accounts for and assumes that we'll have incremental -- significantly incremental investment in areas such as autonomy, AI, crewed, uncrewed teaming and manned control systems. So we feel that our investment is going to the right places as these platforms and systems evolve. Yes, sure. Thank you, Sheila and good morning. You kind of nailed it in your question. The leader of growth will be MFC over this time period through 2027. And I would put them at the high-single-digit clip very comfortably based on the backlog that they have today and the visibility we have to incremental orders. The other three business areas in this framework, at least starting off with this low-single-digit, the rest of them will be in this low-single-digit framework pretty kind of consistently. Now how do we go from a low-single-digit to a high single-digit? Quite frankly, a lot of that opportunity is already sitting in the backlog. If the system can convert, and I'd say the entire enterprise, so it's not just supply chain, it's our operations as well can convert on that backlog quicker, and we did see this in 2024. If you recall, we came into the year thinking that we would grow low-single-digit, and we converted that and changed it to 5% growth here in 2024. So under the same framework, it is a step change from where we are in 2024, but we demonstrated that we can improve throughout the year. So as that visibility gets better, that would enable us to go from a low-single-digit to mid-single digit. Yes, there are other campaigns and some of those are classified. If you go back a few years, we talked about the four pillars of growth, new awards was an element of that as well as classified growth. New awards, we got one of those, which is the next-generation interceptor. So that's already a win. The other one would be in our -- really our classified portfolio, and those are campaigns that will happen over the next, I would say, six to 18 months. But as I mentioned -- and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the foundation for the growth to mid-single digit is pretty solid. At least in the short term, is more of a conversion issue. Yes. I would say the volatility is kind of, I would say in this year-to-date, their performance is better than prior year. We've seen an improvement. When you put aside the losses related to the classified program, their profit adjustments year-to-date have shown growth, and they're performing, I think, pretty well in the base. So this was a good quarter, as an example, we didn't really record any losses related to the classified program, and we delivered 14.4% margins in the quarter, and that's essentially where they're operating this year ex the losses. You got it right as far as timing, we would expect, we recorded $100 million in the first quarter. So that would say that about $225 million were record or what's included in our guidance for the fourth quarter. As far as your question on the accounting, it's a good question. It really depends on the facts and circumstances and the probability. We have to make an assessment and a probability of the exercise of certain options. And so the visibility is clear as things are more short term and the visibility gets a little bit more murkier as you go out a little bit further. So you have to make assessments of similar facts such as customer interactions that we have, their intentions, visibility to funding over a longer period of time, the performance of the system is one in how we're doing from a testing perspective. So all of these factors taken together have to go into the assessment to determine if and when we record a forward loss. And so that's where we are. As far as 2025, a baseline assumption would be that we -- you go from $325 million to anywhere between say $250 million to $300 million in losses in 2025, assuming a one per year type of framework. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have to take another look at whether or not there will be additional losses that have to be recognized early on to your question. And again, that's a really quarter-to-quarter assessment that we have to make. On the question on the classified program at aeronautics we did realize incremental risk in the quarter. In the press release, we had about $80 million there. Year-to-date, we're about $145 million. So we have, obviously, realized some incremental learnings that have converted to incremental losses. It's a classified program, so I can't really talk too much about what it is. But what I can tell you is that we are essentially meeting our scheduled objectives, albeit at a higher cost. And I would say the cost is really a function of the aggressive pricing that we bid originally. And so as we recalibrate, we are kind of keeping an eye on our cost. We'll do continuous reviews, as you would expect us to do. And we'll have another review here in November with the team so we can go back and understand and pressure test the risk management plan. But it's not just an oversight function. I think it's incumbent upon us as a leadership team to not only provide the oversight, but also make sure that we're providing the tools and the resources to make sure they're successful. This program will be managed as a whole team, and we're all in it together. And as I mentioned on the cost, it's -- again, it was bid aggressively. Jim and I have been pretty firm over the past few years that really reining in those practices, and we really haven't seen any of those since that time. And so we've got a contractual commitment that we've got to meet, and we will meet, and we'll manage this program as best as we possibly can. And I think part of what we're trying to do is change the trajectory, drive towards better outcomes, while at the same time deliver the mission capability that we've contracted to give our customer. Yes. Let me just add to -- Doug, I'll try to give you a little bit of color on the cash impact to your question. As Jim mentioned, what we're looking at here is an output estimate of about 180 aircraft deliveries per year over the next three plus years. So effectively, what will happen is cash collections will smooth out over this period of time. This is important to point out that, that remains consistent with the low single-digit free cash flow growth framework that we've articulated today and previously. Just maybe a little bit on 2024. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we estimated the impact this year of unfavorable impact of about $600 million. That consists of two factors. Number one, less deliveries than the 156 rate. So we'll deliver in that range of 100 aircraft or so. So there's going to be less aircraft delivered and so there's an impact for cash flow from that. The second impact is the impact of the withholds. While we will release some of those with holds this year based on completion of milestones, there will still be some that carry over into next year and a little bit into 2026. Now in 2024, that's unfavorable impact was $600 million, that was entirely offset by other working capital efficiencies in the rest of the portfolio of about $600 million, mostly through advances that we've seen there. And so the net impact and then what enabled us to deliver the same free cash flow and, in fact, better than the midpoint that we had originally guided to was that offset. As you go to 2025, will deliver more aircraft. And so we will see the benefit of having delivered more aircraft and we will also see the benefit of having incremental withholds released. I would quantify that today at around $300 million to $400 million. And then that will then continue to flow in 2016 and beyond. And hopefully, that helps. Yes. Thanks, Rich. Essentially, in my prepared remarks, I talked about the inorganic and organic means of managing this pension headwind. The inorganic would essentially be the issuance of debt as a primary enabler to be able to do that. That's still on the table. As I said on my prepared remarks that we're going to go through between here and the end of the year and finalize our plans based on various factors. And as you would expect, we're trying to exhaust all of the opportunities on an organic basis. So what can we bring out in working capital over this period of time to be able to offset as much as possible. To the extent that we can't, we do have the ability to go on financing to take out. I think the key takeaway there is that I remain confident that we'll be able to do that through the combination of organic working capital reduction as well as some level of inorganic mostly on the debt side. Just on the framework as it relates to 2025. 2025 is very consistent with the multi-year framework that's on that chart, which is our starting point here is a low single-digit growth framework off of the 2024 number. And again, it's -- we're looking at MFC being the driver there, kind of starting off at a high single-digit rate. And the other business areas being either flat, slightly flat or on the up in this low-single digits. And so that's really our starting point. Again, we'll give a lot more color in January as we finalize these plans. But I'd say '25 is consistent with what we're saying in the multi-year framework. I guess just a reminder, David, I think it applies to '25 as it does in the three year framework. When you went to '24, we started at low-single digit. We upgraded it to mid-single digit. I think as our visibility improves, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there's still the case where we could be mid-single digits in 2025, but we need to see it come through. We need to see the production and operating systems be able to consistently grow at a mid-single digit CAGR, which is a lot easier said than done in the environment that we've been living under over the past few years. Good morning. It's a great question, Jason. Let me just first say terms in the framework. I mean, obviously, over 2025, there's better visibility than there would be for 2027. So the outlook feels good. And so my comment in terms of confidence as far as the demand signal being able to drive to a mid-single digit growth rate in '25 is heightened by better visibility. If you think about what we've seen in over, and I'll take '24 as an example in answer to your question, given what we've seen the demand cycle would have also enabled a higher growth rate than 5% in 2024. So I think the answer to your question in the short term is yes. I don't know that I could sit there and say that a multi-year framework would be a high-single digit number. But I think that given all the right circumstances, you could definitely see a year that could deliver high-single digit. But again, we're starting from low, we got to get to mid, we get to mid and then we can talk about anything beyond that. First things first. Good morning. Well, Rob, the way I would characterize it is just quick math, one day equates to about $200 million of free cash flow. And I would say through '25 and '26, we would have to do at least two days of working capital improvement. So is it possible? Yes, in both years, so you'd have to do cumulatively four days through '25 and '26. It's possible, but it's a stretch. And that's why I believe kind of a better, higher confidence plan would be to combine the initiatives on working capital with some of potential inorganic capabilities or cash generation with the ability to really draw that back down over a period of time with continued cash flow growth. And so I think it's -- what I would say next year is that we've probably got two days that are not yet solution between now and the end of the year that we got to go figure out. And to the extent that we can and that relates to 2025, will that be -- the inorganic becomes the gap filler."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Over the past few months, Lockheed Martin's people, systems and platforms have again demonstrated their ability to enhance security in Eastern Europe, the Red Sea and the Middle East. From the PAC-3s critical role in air defense, to the Aegis Combat System with AI augmentation to the F-35 of this advanced sensor and data management capabilities, our company has made major contributions to Allied and Partner defense. We continue to demonstrate the impact of our 21st Century security strategy by harnessing the latest digital technologies to continuously improve mission effectiveness, strengthening and scaling defense production system, and expanding industrial cooperation among our allies and partners. Consequently, demand for our defense technology solutions remains robust, with a backlog of nearly $160 billion greater than two times our annual revenue. Our strong performance so far in 2024 extends beyond blast backlog as well giving us confidence to raise our 2024 full year outlook for sales, segment operating profit and EPS. In the second quarter, sales increased 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially and reflected growth in all four of our business segments. The supply chain continues to improve and defense outlays also continue to increase. Our focus on operational execution helped us achieve segment operating margins of 11.3%, up 20 basis points compared to last year's second quarter and free cash flow of more than $1.5 billion, an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. Jay and Maria will talk more about the specifics of the quarterly results in a moment, but suffice it to say, we are pleased with our financial performance and momentum so far in 2024. I'm especially happy to report the progress we have made on the F-35 program. As announced last week, we began deliveries of the first Technology Refresh 3 or TR-3 configured F-35 aircraft to the US government. The TR-3 upgrade and further Block 4 enhancements represent a critical evolution in capability and their full development remains a top priority for us. These and further software updates over the life of the program will ensure that F-35 remains an effective deterrent to aggression and the cornerstone of Joint All-Domain operations now and decades into the future. We continue to produce at a rate of 156 aircraft per year and expect to deliver 75 to 100 aircraft in the second half of 2024. Over 95% of TR-3 capabilities are currently being flight-tested and we look forward to delivering full TR-3 combat capability to the customer. In addition, we expect deliveries of F-35 aircraft to exceed production for the next few years. Jay will talk about the financial aspects of our current status in a moment. Continued close collaboration with the joint program office, or the JPO as known and across our industry partners has been and will be essential to meet and exceed expectations of this critical national defense program in a timely and cost-effective manner. I met with my F-35 industry CEO colleagues in Fort Worth recently to set plans for enhancing the cooperation on our software and hardware and test integration processes, among other initiatives to increase speed and efficiency in the program. The TR-3 hardware and software provide a significant upgrade in computing power that enables major improvements and capability to our airmen, sailors and marine as well as to our partner and allied nations. International customers continue to recognize the superior capabilities of this, the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world in key aircraft node in the DoD's Joint All-Domain architecture. On the international front, Israel announced a third squad of F-35As, increasing their fleet by 50%. Greece is in the final stages discussion with the U.S. government to procure the F-35 and we continue to see interest from Romania as well as a potential new customer. Beyond the F-35 is the quarterback of Joint All-Domain operations our ongoing collaboration with the U.S. military during major exercises with deployed operational units exemplifies our commitment and ability to enhance readiness and integrate capabilities across all of our customers' missions and priorities. In June, new advanced capabilities from across Lockheed Martin contributed to the tenth iteration of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's Valiant Shield exercise. During this exercise, there were several significant milestones demonstrating how we are continually improving our forces capabilities and enhancing our deterrence posture. One example is that we successfully integrated digital command and control capabilities with the Indo-Pacific Command's Joint Fires network, enhancing real-time decision-make commanders and operational agility for the forest. Our operational planning data fusion engine was employed to coordinate joint operations using live real-time data producing actual tasking orders at combat relevant speed. And another example from the same exercise, Lockheed Martin Space and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics jointly demonstrated the ability to autonomously optimize intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, or ISR, collection and enhance their imagery for quick, automated target detection and classification, facilitating data delivery across a wide range of space-based and airborne platforms like never before. In addition, the U.S. Army tested our Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, against the moving maritime target in the Pacific Ocean. This next-generation missile enables further improved range and precision to deter potential adverse series from even greater distances. According to the Army, this test is a significant step in the PrSM programs progress. We've also moved toward realizing the 21st Century Security Joint All-Domain vision with the signing of a landmark agreement with Australia's Department of Defense to build their future joint air battle management system. They call it Project AIR6500 Phase 1. As we've discussed before, this system will provide the Australian defense force with leading-edge integrated air and missile defense capability using next-generation technologies to combat high-speed threats and establish Australia's integrated air and missile defense as one of the most highly advanced in the world. We also continued to demonstrate 21st Century security in other innovative ways. In May, our Skunk Works Tactical artificial intelligence team successfully executed their second set of flight tests with the University of Iowa\u2019s, Operator Performance Laboratory. RAI flew an L29 jet aircraft by means of heading, speed and altitude command sent directly to the onboard autopilot than to the plans flight controls. This test has shown our AI team can rapidly develop, iterate and integrate artificial intelligence technology for autonomous flight operations. We're also making great progress in another leading-edge defense tech initiative, hypersonic strike, which is a critical element of deterrence in today's world. As announced by the Department of Defense in June, the US Navy and US Army completed an end-to-end all up ground flight test of a common person missile, core to the Navy's conventional prompt strike or CPS and the army's long-range hypersonic weapons programs. The test marked a major step forward for the nation's development of hypersonic systems by Lockheed Martin. Pivoting to the supply chain, we continue to explore opportunities to drive our concept of anti-fragility across the global defense industrial base. For example, we recently signed a collaborative memorandum of understanding with Ryan Mittal to work together on land, air and naval opportunities. One of our first initiatives is the new Global Mobile Artillery Rocket System or GMARS is a highly interoperable two-pod launcher system intended to fire the MLRS-based munitions. Combining these combat-proven systems will help address the growing demand for long-range rocket capabilities in Europe and elsewhere. On our PAC-3 program, international collaboration remains strong as well, including development of indigenous capabilities with the opening of a PAC-3 MSE launch tube production line in Poland, as well as a memorandum of understanding with Grupo Oes\u00eda in Spain to provide an opportunity to manufacture factory MSE parts for worldwide customers. Spain and the United States also formalized an agreement for Spain to purchase pack free MSE missiles and related support, making Spain PAC-3s 16th partner nation. I'd also like to briefly discuss the latest status of the US defense budget. The House approved their version of the FY '25 defense appropriations. So the focus now shifts to the Senate where the process continues before the reconciliation phase later this year. We believe our portfolio is well-aligned to current and future customer mission priorities, including air superiority with the F-35 and CH-53K and Black Hawk or UH-60M. Our integrated air and missile defense with PAC-3 and NGI, hypersonics with CPS and the LRHW I just mentioned a minute ago and tactical strike weapons and munitions with JASSM, LRASM, PrSM, JAVELIN and GIMLERS. Ultimately, we look forward to the conclusion of the USG appropriations process and the continued utilization of the existing supplement mental funding. On the international front, I was encouraged by conversations I had at the recent NATO Summit a few weeks ago in Washington. International partners and allies remain steadfast in their pursuit of elevated defense spending to strengthen the overall integrated deterrence posture of the alliance given the tragic and ongoing conflict in Ukraine. I'll now turn it over to Jay for award highlights and additional commentary on our financial results.\nJay Malave: Thanks, Jim. Similar to last quarter, I'll provide an overview of consolidated financials and touch on a handful of operational items before handing off to Maria, who will cover business area financials, and then I'll come back to discuss the updated outlook. Starting on chart 4. The positive momentum we had to begin the year continued into the second quarter with sales up 9% to over $18 billion, led by RMS and MFC. As Jim mentioned, throughput remained strong reflecting an improving supply chain and internal operating cadence. Segment operating profit of $2 billion was up 10% year-over-year, and consolidated margins were 11.3%. With all four business areas achieving double-digit return on sales, the first time since the third quarter of 2022. Net favorable profit adjustments in the quarter were higher than prior year and were 21% of segment operating profit, driving the stronger margins. GAAP earnings per share of $6.85 increased 3% year-over-year, driven by higher profit and lower share count, partially offset by severance impairment charges at RMS and Sikorsky, higher interest expense and lower pension income. On the new business front, we recorded over $17 billion of orders in the second quarter for a book-to-bill ratio just below one. We generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to just under $2.8 billion, and we continue to make the necessary investments in innovation and infrastructure to position the company and our customers for future success with $400 million -- $405 million in research and development and $370 million in capital expenditures the second quarter. Finally, we returned over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Now, I'll touch on a few business activities in more detail. The order strength continued at MFC with a book-to-bill over two in the quarter, led by the $4 billion plus Army award spanning multiyear PAC-3 delivery requirements and supporting our production ramp projections. And Poland officials signed a letter of acceptance to purchase 400 JASSM ERs, the largest international order and program history, providing another ally with the latest generation JASSM variant. At Sikorsky, its platforms remain in high demand as the US State Department announced approval for four foreign military sales of Black Hawk to Austria, Brazil and Sweden. This opens the door to the potential sale of 36 Black Hawks, adding 12 helicopters each to each country's existing Blackhawk fleet. In addition, the government of Greece signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 35 UH-60M BLACK HAWK helicopters. These upgraded aircraft will support the Hellenic Ministry of Defense's ongoing modernization. It will serve as a dependable multi-role helicopter with unmatched interoperability to support vital national and allied security missions. In the space domain, late last month, NASA selected Lockheed Martin to develop and build the nation's next-generation weather satellite constellation for NOAA known as Geostationary Extended Observations, or GeoXO. This award builds on our prior work with environmental sensing technologies, which recently culminated with the launch of GOES-U, which will leverage advanced instruments and rapid updates to provide crucial data for weather forecasting, severe storm tracking and climate monitoring. Let me stop here and hand it over to Maria to get into the business area of financial detail.\nMaria Ricciardone : Thanks, Jay. Today, I'll discuss second quarter year-over-year results for the business areas, starting with Aeronautics on Chart 5. Second quarter sales at Aero were up 6% year-over-year. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes across F-35 and the continued production ramp on the F-16 program. Segment operating profit increased 5% with higher volume and favorable mix being offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments. Regarding aircraft deliveries, we resumed F-35 deliveries in Q3, as Jim shared, and we've delivered our 1,000 F-35s. On F-16, we delivered four in the second quarter and are targeting around 20 for the year. For 130J, we delivered five in the quarter, reaching a milestone of 2,700 deliveries of this critical tactical airlifter and expect around 20 deliveries for this year. Turning to Missiles and Fire Control on Chart 6. MFC had another strong quarter with sales up 13% from the prior year, driven by production ramps on a handful of our precision fires programs within the tactical and strike missile segment, primarily Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System, GMLRS and Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, LRASM. Segment operating profit increased 21% year-over-year due to higher profit booking rate adjustments led by the PAC-3 and Apache programs margins returned to 14.5%, which is more in line with historical rates. MFC backlog reached a record level of almost $35 billion in Q2 supported by continued global demand for several of our missile ammunition programs. Key awards included the PAC-3 award that Jay mentioned as well as $1.3 billion in combined awards for launchers, including HIMARS, and M270 upgrades and a $500 million follow-on production contract for JAGM and HELLFIRE to support U.S. and international customers. On the delivery front, I'll highlight a few of the key program quantities in the quarter. We delivered 100 PAC-3 interceptors, more than 2,000 GMLRS rockets, over 2,700 HELLFIRE missiles and 11 HIMARS systems. Shifting to rotary emission systems on Chart 7. Sales increased 17% in the quarter to over $4.5 billion primarily driven by higher volume at integrated warfare systems and sensors on radar and laser programs as well as the Canadian Surface Combatant program. Sikorsky programs also saw higher volume led by BLACK HAWK and CH-53K. Also of note in the quarter, we delivered five S-70 helicopters to international customers, which resulted in about $115 million of revenue on a passage of title POT basis. Operating profit increased 9% year-over-year due to higher volume, partially offset by lower profit booking rate adjustments. Now, for a brief summary of helicopter deliveries. In addition to the five S-70 helicopters I mentioned, Sikorsky delivered five Black Hawks, four combat rescue helicopters, and one VH-92 Presidential helicopter in the quarter. On the delivery front, a few of the key program quantities in the second quarter, we -- yes, sorry about that. Let's go to space. Finally, with space on Chart 8. Sales increased 1% year-over-year. The growth was driven by higher volume on strategic and missile defense programs, primarily hypersonics and Fleet Ballistic Missile, FBM. Partially offsetting this growth was lower volume on classified programs and Orion. Operating profit increased 11% compared to Q2 2023, driven by favorable mix and higher profit booking rate adjustments. Now, I'll turn it back over to Jay to wrap-up prepared remarks.\nJay Malave: All right. Thanks Maria and let's shift over to the outlook on Chart 9. Given our strong year-to-date performance, sustained back position, and improving visibility into key programs, we're raising our expectations for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook for sales, segment operating profit, and earnings per share. We're increasing sales by $1.75 billion at the midpoint and tightening the range to $70.5 billion to $71.5 billion. The new midpoint reflects a solid 5% growth from 2023 with increases across all four business areas. We're also increasing segment operating profit expectation based on the higher sales with the new range of $7.35 billion to $7.5 billion and anticipate consolidated segment operating profit margins to remain at 10.5%. Business area margins remained consistent with our prior guidance at Aero and MFC, while RMS is down about 50 basis points at the midpoint and space is up 40 basis points at the midpoint. The RMS reduction is driven by Sikorsky as the business faces continued cost pressure and absorption headwinds, the impact of which have exceeded benefits from its cost reduction programs. Conversely, space is benefiting from solid performance and proactive reduction efforts. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 11. We're increasing the midpoint by $0.35 to $26.35 with a range of $26.10 to $26.60 for the full year. Primary drivers of the change are shown on this chart with increases coming from incremental profit of $0.49 and other below-the-line items of $0.13. Partially offsetting those items are the RMS charges totaling $0.29 and from the severance actions and the asset write-downs taken in the second quarter. As Jim mentioned, we're encouraged by the F-35 delivery restart and continuous progress being made towards delivering full combat capability. We're holding our free cash flow expectation in the range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion, which absorbs a potential unfavorable impact from longer deferrals of final F-35 delivery payments. This is made possible by proactive actions taken across the company to offset these potential headwinds. On the cash deployment side, we still expect over $3 billion of IR&D and capital investments, while the dividend, along with the expected $4 billion of share repurchases, maintain attractive shareholder returns. Lastly, on backlog, we continue to expect backlog to grow in 2024 even with the higher sales outlook, which provides a line of sight to future growth. Before I wrap, I'd like to highlight a few other key assumptions regarding the updated outlook. First, we expect F-35 18/19 to be awarded this year, maintaining program funding and continuity. Second, we continue to expect $325 million of losses on the MFC classified program, of which $100 million has been recognized year-to-date. And third, this outlook does not assume any pension contributions in 2024. So in summary on Chart 12, our solid first half results give us confidence in raising the full year outlook for sales, profit and EPS, while holding the cash flow outlook, reflecting our ongoing efforts to deliver predictable, and improving operating and financial performance as is expected of us. It all starts with a relentless focus on executing to our programmatic commitments and delivering critical 21st Century security mission capabilities where we strive to continuously improve. To that end, we are investing in our people, processes and systems through the 1LMX transformation, with the goal of unlocking step changes in efficiency, velocity and program execution that delivers security capabilities in ahead of ready speed to our customers. And we're confident that these management priorities and actions convert to a compelling long-term value proposition for customers and shareholders alike. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from the line of Kristine Liwag from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nKristine Liwag: Hi, Jim, Jay and Maria. Release from Farnborough, the F-16 is flying in the background right now. So apologies for the grower in the background.\nJim Taiclet: Let's call it the sound of Freedom, Christine, it's good.\nKristine Liwag: I mean, it's a crazy or beautiful aircraft here. So the delivery guidance for the F-35 in the second half of this year is still fairly wide. Can you talk about the scenarios where there are lower and upper? What would have to happen for you to hit the lower upper end of the range? And also with production at 156 per year, when should deliver and production catch up for the program?\nJim Taiclet: So Kristine, I'll start and emphasize that we're going to do this unwind and conduct the deliveries with safety and quality is our number one priority. So just starting with that foundation, we actually have the ability to add resources, which have already been identified and designated. And that's test pilots, maintenance team, software and hardware engineers to get the flight test done that we need to, be at the higher end of that range. But we want to make sure that if it's weather, if it's pilot, crew rest issues, anything like that, we will accommodate for those. But we should -- we have the resources in place, I'll say, that should enable us to get to the higher end of that range, if you will.\nJay Malave: Yes. Let me just add, just to reiterate, Kristine, we expect anywhere between 75 to 110. Yes, with less than six months left, it is a wide range. I would say, over the next few months, we'll get much better insights into the induction and flow of aircraft going into the test and production cycle, really bringing in aircraft that are parked as well as aircraft that are coming outside of the -- from the production flow. And as we get those learnings, we'll be able to get a better assessment what the delivery requirements will be and what we expect for the year. And so it will take us a couple of months just to make sure we get that process learned out. It's well planned, but we actually have to demonstrate it in actual practice. As far as the future, from terms of reducing on the backlog of aircraft, our target is anywhere between 12 to 18 aircraft deliveries per month and really to burn down the aircraft backlog. And so that will take us a number of years here to get through that. We've already made progress so far. Since the announcement of the restart, we've delivered 10 aircraft as of Monday yesterday, six with the TR-3 configuration and four with the TR-2 configuration. So we think we're off to a very good start. But again, we really need to have a -- just to monitor the operating cadence of being able bring aircraft from two different flows into one test -- flight test flow. And again, we'll tighten that up later on in the year.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Cai von Rumohr from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nCai von Rumohr : Yes. Thanks so much. So I think you did say that next year, you're going to deliver more F-35s than you will produce. And I think at one point, you mentioned that you get paid $7 million upon each delivery. Walk us through -- you mentioned also the deferral of some payments. So next year, what happens to accrued revenues, because I think with higher deliveries, I assume the final delivery payment basically is incremental even though under POC, the work itself should be relatively level. And then secondly, the cash flow impact. I know that there's a deferral on the payments, but if it was really $7 million, that's potentially a substantial cash flow plus. Thanks so much.\nJay Malave : Okay. Cai, let me just say, first of all, as Jim mentioned, restarting delivery was an important first step really towards delivering the fully combat capable aircraft. Aircraft, the withhold -- the aircraft withhold this final delivery payment is a timing item, as you mentioned. And we're working with the customer to finalize the terms of those final delivery payments. We're making excellent progress, but it would be immature or premature to give details of that because it remains subject to negotiation. Suffice it to say that you will see timing benefit over the next few years as we deliver, but I think we still need to work through and finalize this agreement with the customer. As far as the revenue, I really wouldn't see -- expect much of an incremental benefit in terms of revenue. We continue to build at a 156 rate. We are seeing production a little bit higher this year. But for the most part, we should expect that to be, I think, fairly stable. And yes, we'll see incremental activity in terms of test activity, which does increase penetration on a percent complete basis. But I don't really view that being all that material. And so we just hold the production. We'll expect F-35 to grow mostly from sustainment next year and in the years to come. I think it's important to mention as well that we are -- the headwind on funnel delivery payments are here in 2024. We're holding our outlook, so we're absorbing that with better performance in the rest of the portfolio. Yes, we will see the timing benefits downstream. But as I mentioned before, we have to get just the whole delivery cadence straight. And I just want to make sure I had it straight in terms of the last question. We're targeting anywhere between 12 to 18 months to fully deliver on these parked aircraft. And as I mentioned, we just need to learn out the process over the next few months here and get -- to be able to give better guidance on that.\nCai von Rumohr: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is the line of Scott Deuschle from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nScott Deuschle: Hey, good morning.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nScott Deuschle: Jay, you've been seeing some nice momentum on revenue and now you're seeing some of it on margins as well. I guess at what point do you think you'll be ready to start talking about maybe a better medium-term free cash flow per share growth outlook in this mid-single-digit rate you've been talking about for a while. Do you just need to let these pension headwinds next year and see a bit more growth acceleration? And then you're there. Just curious for how you're thinking about that? thanks.\nJay Malave: Yes. No, I appreciate the question. We've said over the last few months and really the last year or so that our goal has been to increase absolute free cash flow in the low single-digit clip, and then that augmented with share repurchase would get us to a mid-single-digit free cash flow per share expectation. That remains of the outlook. We'll go through our multiyear forecast over the next few months here, we'll be able to give you a better update in the October timeframe. I think given the fact that we're at a higher level in 2024 is a positive, and we continue to expect to grow in 2025 off this higher baseline. So, that in and of itself should result in a higher cash flow baseline as well. But there's a lot of work to be done between now and then. And so I would like to have the benefit of going through that in more detail, and we'll update that to you at least preliminarily in October.\nScott Deuschle: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Gavin Parsons from UBS. Please go ahead.\nGavin Parsons: Thanks. Good morning.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nGavin Parsons: Maybe sticking on revenue. You guys have talked about supply chain kind of being a bottleneck, is the upside more on the demand front or on the unlocking of the supply chain side? And if latter, can you just talk a little bit more about supply chain and what you expect going forward in the second half, because I think the second half a lot less growth?\nJay Malave: Well, I'd say it's a combination of both. We ended the year in 2023 with a $160 billion backlog, which was a record. We ended here in the second quarter at $158 billion was slightly below where it ended a record with significantly higher sales than we thought through the first half of the year. We expect -- our continue -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we continue to expect the backlog to increase at end of this year, which gives us more visibility into further growth in 2025 and beyond. So, we're very bullish on where that stands from a backlog standpoint. As far as supply chain, we did see improvement. We are seeing continued improvement there and on-time delivery. The part shortages continue to come down. Having said that, there are still areas where we're -- particularly where we're ramping up some of our major programs where we still have some work to be done there. And we're still going through many of the initiatives and actions that -- proactive actions that we've talked about in the past, which is some in-sourcing on some capabilities, dual sourcing, where it makes sense. Also, we have deployed, and we continue to deploy personnel to provide on-site assistance at our suppliers. And of course, we also continue to look at product redesign. But I'd say, by and large, we are seeing an improvement in the in the supply chain, which also gives us confidence for that continued growth in the future.\nJim Taiclet: And Gavin, I just give you some qualitative background on demand side. Our strategy includes driving the latest digital technologies kind of through an open architecture, standard-based system to the DoD. And by doing that and making our product services platforms compliant or in line with those future concepts of open architecture and standards to pull through those products, services and platforms. So we're starting to see that already. And we're demonstrating whether it's exercises or in real conflict like the Red Sea, doing things like over-the-air updates to the AEGIS system, which is decades old, but it can be improved very quickly now just like when you download overnight on your Tesla, we can do a download overnight over the air on the AEGIS radar and combat control system and double, triple the effectiveness against things like low flying drones and cruise missiles. So we're actually implementing those kinds of things on a standard base architecture into our products and services today, which I expect will continue to pull them through.\nGavin Parsons: Great. Appreciate the detail.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Please go ahead.\nPete Skibitski: Hey, good morning, guys. Guys on missiles and fire control, if you think about what was appropriate in the 2024 baseline budget and the Ukraine supplemental, how much order flow is still to come there for you guys at MFC? And also, just if we think about the growth cadence there, you talked about $750 million a year in the past, you're going to be well above that this year. So I'm just wondering if that cadence is going to come back into play 2025 on a higher baseline. Thanks.\nJay Malave: Sure. I mean there's still plenty of runway in orders at MFC. As I mentioned, the book-to-bill in the quarter was above 2%, and we're still expecting additional orders at the end of the year, particularly in JASSM/LRASM in second half here. They're still even under supplemental, there's some opportunity there to continue to build their backlog and so we've talked about $750 million. You're right. They're going to be above that this year. We see continued growth there next year, and they're going to be, again, the highest grower within Lockheed Martin for the next three to five years. So we're pretty bullish on that. Much of that is already in the backlog, but there's still plenty more to come in terms of build -- continuing to build that backlog. The key for us is to make sure that we can meet the demand and ramp up all these programs to our customers' requirements. And the team has been laser-focused on making sure they can do that, and you're seeing the benefits of that this year with the sales coming in higher. So again, we keep our head down, continue to deliver. The demand is both domestic and international at MFC. And again, they're going to be a significant source of growth for Lockheed Martin or for the next three to five years.\nJim Taiclet: And Pete, it's Jim. Again, on a qualitative perspective, I tell our teams and our executives internally we're in the aerospace and defense industry, but we're in the deterrence business. right? So if you step back and say what contributes to deterrence from an MFC, for example? And I think anybody that's everyone watching Clint Eastwood would movie will know that, if we run out of ammunition, you're in a lot of trouble, right? So part of deterrence is showing that, a, you have enough ammunition stocks to prevail and sustain your operations from an aggressor. That's the first thing. Second thing is you also \u2013 it's helpful to demonstrate that you can produce at rate and ramp that rate quickly. That's our anti-fragility program. And the third piece of it is you can produce and repair MFC and other products in the local theater and not have to bring them all the way back to the US to fix them or drive that production up. That's the third part of our strategy. So everything we do is based on deterrents and strengthening that. And MSC has a huge role in making sure that adversaries know that we've got enough stocks in MFC type products, and we can ramp that rate and we can produce in different places and repair in different places should they act. And that's really kind of a qualitative underpinning of what Jay was talking about.\nPete Skibitski: Appreciate it guys.\nJim Taiclet: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Seth Seifman from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nSeth Seifman: Hey. Thanks very much and good morning. Probably just a quick one. Sorry about the background noise here. Just a quick one and kind of big picture. I think, Jay, I think you've said in the past that there was good potential for growth to be at least as strong as 2024 and 2025 and good potential for that growth rate to accelerate. Is that still the case off of the higher revenue base and a higher growth rate here in 2025 -- in 2024?\nJay Malave: Yeah. It's a good question, Seth. And as I mentioned before, we're going -- just going through our process to lay out our multiyear outlook, including 2025 here over the next few months. What I would tell you is that the backlog visibility that we have would support another year similar to 2024. We have to have to go through though, and the operational. The practical operational capability to deliver that is something we go through. And so the demand is there. We have to make sure the supply can meet that as well. That's a pretty significant step change over really a two-year span on some of these ramp programs that we're dealing with. And as I mentioned before, we're still dealing with some programs that are still working through trying to get off to the ramp rates.\nOperator: Our next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good morning, guys. Thank you. Maybe if we could talk about profitability. If we look at first half profitability of 10.7, second half implied in the low 10s. Can you walk through some of the moving pieces, maybe in terms of supply chain productivity, I know volumes are lower and how we think about the exit rate for the year?\nJay Malave: Yeah. The second half of the year, Sheila, is -- I mean the most significant would be the program loss at MFC that we have to record in the second half. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we recorded about $100 million here year-to-date. In the second half, we expect about another $225 million. So that will put pressure on margins in back half. The second piece I would say is that, we would have -- even though we had a very strong and solid profit adjustment first half that slows down a little bit in the back half of the year just based on program timing, the timing of risk retirements -- and so just the risk retirements and profit adjustments are not all linear, they incur different aspects of a program life cycle. But what I would say is we feel comfortable with where we're headed. We've talked about 2024 being a low watermark for all net-net margins, and we expect it to improve gradually over the next few years, and we still feel confident that can take place.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nJay Malave: All right.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Ken Herbert from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nKen Herbert: Yes. Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to see and apologies if I missed this, but can you comment on your view of NGAD, and how you're thinking about that now moving forward? And what we might be thinking about in terms of the next catalyst for you on this particular program?\nJim Taiclet : Sure, Ken. It's Jim here. So when it comes to NGAD as a program, we're not authorized an industry to speak to the details of that. So you'd have go to the U.S. government to get insight into that particular program. But I can tell you what we're doing to prepare for the next-generation combat aircraft. So on the investment front, since 1920 -- or 2021 rather, we opened the gates on four high-tech facilities that have the clearance -- the security clearance capability to produce NGAD type components, let's call them, all right? One of them is in Florida, Skunk Works in California, opened a new major factory that I was there to see. We have it in Alabama, two in Georgia. So we have these accredited facilities up and running ahead of the demand, and we're working on programs and products in that classified capability space. So we've already got these facilities up and running. The other resource we have is human in Skunk Works, Marietta and in Fort Worth and other places that can design, test and build using our digital transformation engineering technologies and the digital twin these kind of components, aircraft and others that might go into a NGAD concept. So I can just tell you that Lockheed Martin is ready to produce. We're ready to design. We're ready to build. We are in the process of making sure we're capable in the arenas that the Air Force and the Navy are going to need us to be. So that's really all we can say about that. But I can assure you that we are competitive and ready to go in this space if and when the government pulls a trigger on a real competition and want somebody will be able to produce, we can do it.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Spingarn : Hey, good afternoon, or I guess, it's still morning. But I wanted to ask you about on F-35 and congrats on the resumption of deliveries. But when we think about TR-3 and on the production side of the equation, how is the supply chain in terms of being able to supply enough material and integrated core processors on time for you to maintain the 156 per year. So as the mix goes more toward all TR-3, how well prepared is the supply chain for that?\nJim Taiclet : So we got together, Rob, as I mentioned a few minutes ago in the prepared remarks in Fort Worth about a month with the CEOs of half of those companies that contribute to this in a significant way. We communicated the importance of exactly what you're speaking to which is not just a core processor, but there's a range and a number of other components across all of these companies that need to maintain or increase their production rates and modernize their equipment along the way. And so that communication of those suppliers has been made. They know our plans were well integrated -- more integrated than we ever have, I think, when it comes to test and planning and design iterative software across multiple companies, et cetera. So we're in a position, and as suppliers are telling us they will meet the demand. We will monitor them and continue to even put people in their sights when we need to, to make sure that happens. But we've got the major suppliers together, and they understand the demand rate, quality level we need and a better integration plan for test and development that we have built going forward.\nRob Spingarn: And Jim, just following on to that, how do we think about the cadence for retrofit from TR-2 to 3?\nJim Taiclet: So you're right, Rob, that this is designed for backward integration, if you will. There'll be a schedule that the US government. It comes up with for TR-3. There may be -- it will be up to them as to the cadence, the investment rate, et cetera. But over a period of time, there will be a great number of originally built TR-2 aircraft that will get converted. There's some hardware software upgrades to that.\nRob Spingarn: Is this the kind of thing you expect to be talking about soon? Or this is a few years out, we should be focusing on new production aircraft for now TR-3.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. So again, this is a US government policy decision, so it's better to request that kind of commentary from them, Rob. But we're, again, ready to do it at the rate that we expect -- that they come at us with.\nRob Spingarn: Great. Thanks, so much.\nJim Taiclet: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: Hey good morning everyone.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nNoah Poponak: Jay, could you give us the updated -- I guess, if you snap the line today or just ballpark as you see it, cash flow, pension contribution in CAS recovery for at least '25, and I guess if you had it, and we're willing to give it beyond that would be helpful. And then I guess, can you talk through the pieces of how you grow absolute dollar free cash flow in '25, given the pension headwind you have and how it compares to how quickly you can grow the segment EBIT.\nJay Malave: Yes. So on CAS recovery, this year, we're a little bit under, say, $1.7 billion. We expect that to step down by -- in the range of about $100 million and probably stay at that level for the next few years after that. As far as absolute free cash flow in terms of the buildup and components to being able to continue grow, yes, we've talked about pension being a headwind. We've talked about being in the range of about $1 billion. The areas that we expect to drive cash flow growth would be continued earnings growth as you discussed their net income growth, in addition to some of these benefits and the timing on the F-35. We've talked also about just working capital in general. And even when you put F-35 aside, what we're looking at and going after is our contract asset. If you look here in the second quarter, that was a nearly $14 billion balance that we had net represented in a range and I'll put that in terms of efficiency around 70, 72 days of sales running through the balance at the moment. Since 2020 or so, that's grown from about 55 days. So there's an element of there kind of the F-35 and what we've gone through over the past couple of years here, but there's also been growth outside of the F-35 that represents a lot of opportunity for us to convert into faster billings at a level that we've been we've been able to demonstrate in the past. And that's what focused with on all of the business areas in terms of driving that on a multiyear basis back down to what we've been able to demonstrate. The next thing I'll say, so besides working capital and contract assets that are biggest opportunity is the reduction of payments related to the tax R&D capitalization. So we'll get in the range, I'd say, about $150 million of benefit just through lower payments there. So when you bring all these things together, we think that they generate a path to overcome what we're seeing in the pension and drive us to this target of low single digit. It's not easy. It's not a slam dunk, but we've got a path to be able to do that, and that's what we're driving today to be able deliver next year and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: Thanks. Good morning, everyone, Jim, Jay. Maybe just for you on the -- just talking about -- you've talked a lot about MSC's production ramp that you're going to have over the next couple of years. Just how does this all tie in with the collaborative agreements you got with Ryan Mittal [ph] now, PAC-3 production opening up in Poland and I think Jim also mentioned Spain, an agreement there. Just can you give us an update on PAC-3, what the growth kind of expansion looks like now and same, I guess, on some high HIMARS and JASSM, what some of those growth rates look like? Thanks.\nJay Malave: Sure. A lot of these agreements enable -- they're part of in-country requirements for industrial cooperation. You mentioned Poland, you mentioned Germany, also Australia. And those are enablers for us to build up this backlog and drive this demand. On the PAC-3 specifically, we expect to get to $550 million in 2025, and then to $650 million by 2027. And so all of these orders and these partnerships that we're signing up, while all enablers to us to be able produce and deliver at those rates. And it's not just PAC-3. We've talked about GMLRS going from 10,000 to 14,000. We've talked about Javelin going from 2000 to about 4,000. We've talked JASSM and LRASM going from about 700 a year to 1,100 a year, so all of these orders that we're seeing, all these customer engagements that we have both domestic and international are all enablers to drive to these rates that we're building to. And so what they do is fill in the bucket to bring us to that backlog that's necessary for us to generate those sales. And we're on track to that.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi Research. Please go ahead.\nJason Gursky: Good morning everybody. Jim, I wanted to just throw a big picture one at you, and maybe have you kind of wrap all of this together and kind of what you're seeing both in the near and in the long-term? And maybe just get your sense of maybe with a few more quarters here of hindsight, some of the lessons learned from the conflict in Ukraine. What you at Lockheed have learned from that whether you're investing in any new areas as a result of that? And kind of the feedback loop that you're getting from your customer both here in the United States, as well some of our allied nations as well. Are we seeing a development of a new set of requirements and investment areas kind of where are you spending and how are you going about doing it? Just a big picture, here we are middle of 2024, what have we learned from Ukraine? And what are we doing?\nJim Taiclet: So Jason, I would say that there's a wide range of lessons from the Ukraine conflict unfortunately, as it is, but there's learning from it. One is that traditional system, if you will, like Javelin, at the initial invasion, made a significant contribution to the initial defense of Ukraine because it was a classic armor attack and armor-supported infantry attack, meaning there were armored vehicles that were spearheading the drive to Kiev. And when those vehicles got out in front of their support system that the Javelin, for example, made a tremendous difference in stopping that attack short, right? So, you have a traditional system that was designed for land warfare -- traditional land warfare, if you will, that was highly effective. So, we did learn from that. Now, there's jamming both ways, electronic warfare, there's cyber and it's like I tell my teams like your high school wrestling coach that for every move, there's a counter move. So, if you jam GPS, we tweak the system, either the satellite or the receiver or have an alternative form of navigation or targeting, and we react to that. So, on one hand, traditional systems are still effective. On the other hand, you have to be able to adapt quickly. I'd say that was the main lesson there. Another one, similar situation, PAC-3, again, decades in service. And now there's a hypersonic missile threat from Russia, which was launched on a number of occasions. I think all those occasions, none of those missiles were successfully reaching their target because the PAC-3 was modified to be able to address the hypersonic missile threat. And then we'll go to the kind of the other side of the issue, which is, okay, drones became a more important element of land warfare than it had been before, -- and in sea warfare actually, Ukrainians to sea -- autonomous sea vehicles to significant extent and success and also drones and unmanned aerial vehicles, too. So, this is not the first time. Those kinds of systems have been used in prior conflicts, including in the Middle East and the counterterrorism wars, if you will. But the Ukrainians took it to a new level, literally sinking capital shifts with unmanned aerial systems. So, there are lessons there, too. That's something our company is quite involved with a lot of is classified, whether it's kinetic or surveillance, unmanned aerial systems, but we're learning from those too. So, we work with drones as smallest ones that a marine can unpack from a backpack and launch by hand to aircraft size drones, if you will. So, we're involved in that game, and we did take the lessons from the Ukraine war. And that's traditional systems are still essential at bulk and scale. And secondly, they have to be much more adaptable than they ever had to be before. And that kind of supports our digital technology effort and campaign to say, let's use those best digital technologies to make those legacy systems better and better and all the time not wait for a conflict to force us to do that.\nMaria Ricciardone: Great. Hey Lois, I think we've come to the top of the hour. So, I'll turn it back over to Jim for some final thoughts.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks Maria. So, before we close, I'd like to thank our Lockheed Martin team whose dedicated efforts to advance our customers' missions and propelled our solid results this quarter, as you heard from Jay. Our capabilities are recognized around the world as the best in defense tech. And that is thanks to our to our employees' hard work, dedication, and commitment to continued innovation. With 21st Century security technologies, I just described our robust backlog and focus on transforming our operations internal digital transformation program. Our company has a strong foundation for growth for years to come. So I look forward to speaking with you again on our next call in October, and Lois that concludes our call for today.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our second quarter 2024 earnings call. Over the past few months, Lockheed Martin's people, systems and platforms have again demonstrated their ability to enhance security in Eastern Europe, the Red Sea and the Middle East. From the PAC-3s critical role in air defense, to the Aegis Combat System with AI augmentation to the F-35 of this advanced sensor and data management capabilities, our company has made major contributions to Allied and Partner defense. We continue to demonstrate the impact of our 21st Century security strategy by harnessing the latest digital technologies to continuously improve mission effectiveness, strengthening and scaling defense production system, and expanding industrial cooperation among our allies and partners. Consequently, demand for our defense technology solutions remains robust, with a backlog of nearly $160 billion greater than two times our annual revenue. Our strong performance so far in 2024 extends beyond blast backlog as well giving us confidence to raise our 2024 full year outlook for sales, segment operating profit and EPS. In the second quarter, sales increased 9% year-over-year and 5% sequentially and reflected growth in all four of our business segments. The supply chain continues to improve and defense outlays also continue to increase. Our focus on operational execution helped us achieve segment operating margins of 11.3%, up 20 basis points compared to last year's second quarter and free cash flow of more than $1.5 billion, an increase both year-over-year and sequentially. Jay and Maria will talk more about the specifics of the quarterly results in a moment, but suffice it to say, we are pleased with our financial performance and momentum so far in 2024. I'm especially happy to report the progress we have made on the F-35 program. As announced last week, we began deliveries of the first Technology Refresh 3 or TR-3 configured F-35 aircraft to the US government. The TR-3 upgrade and further Block 4 enhancements represent a critical evolution in capability and their full development remains a top priority for us. These and further software updates over the life of the program will ensure that F-35 remains an effective deterrent to aggression and the cornerstone of Joint All-Domain operations now and decades into the future. We continue to produce at a rate of 156 aircraft per year and expect to deliver 75 to 100 aircraft in the second half of 2024. Over 95% of TR-3 capabilities are currently being flight-tested and we look forward to delivering full TR-3 combat capability to the customer. In addition, we expect deliveries of F-35 aircraft to exceed production for the next few years. Jay will talk about the financial aspects of our current status in a moment. Continued close collaboration with the joint program office, or the JPO as known and across our industry partners has been and will be essential to meet and exceed expectations of this critical national defense program in a timely and cost-effective manner. I met with my F-35 industry CEO colleagues in Fort Worth recently to set plans for enhancing the cooperation on our software and hardware and test integration processes, among other initiatives to increase speed and efficiency in the program. The TR-3 hardware and software provide a significant upgrade in computing power that enables major improvements and capability to our airmen, sailors and marine as well as to our partner and allied nations. International customers continue to recognize the superior capabilities of this, the most advanced fighter aircraft in the world in key aircraft node in the DoD's Joint All-Domain architecture. On the international front, Israel announced a third squad of F-35As, increasing their fleet by 50%. Greece is in the final stages discussion with the U.S. government to procure the F-35 and we continue to see interest from Romania as well as a potential new customer. Beyond the F-35 is the quarterback of Joint All-Domain operations our ongoing collaboration with the U.S. military during major exercises with deployed operational units exemplifies our commitment and ability to enhance readiness and integrate capabilities across all of our customers' missions and priorities. In June, new advanced capabilities from across Lockheed Martin contributed to the tenth iteration of U.S. Indo-Pacific Command's Valiant Shield exercise. During this exercise, there were several significant milestones demonstrating how we are continually improving our forces capabilities and enhancing our deterrence posture. One example is that we successfully integrated digital command and control capabilities with the Indo-Pacific Command's Joint Fires network, enhancing real-time decision-make commanders and operational agility for the forest. Our operational planning data fusion engine was employed to coordinate joint operations using live real-time data producing actual tasking orders at combat relevant speed. And another example from the same exercise, Lockheed Martin Space and Lockheed Martin Aeronautics jointly demonstrated the ability to autonomously optimize intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, or ISR, collection and enhance their imagery for quick, automated target detection and classification, facilitating data delivery across a wide range of space-based and airborne platforms like never before. In addition, the U.S. Army tested our Precision Strike Missile, or PrSM, against the moving maritime target in the Pacific Ocean. This next-generation missile enables further improved range and precision to deter potential adverse series from even greater distances. According to the Army, this test is a significant step in the PrSM programs progress. We've also moved toward realizing the 21st Century Security Joint All-Domain vision with the signing of a landmark agreement with Australia's Department of Defense to build their future joint air battle management system. They call it Project AIR6500 Phase 1. As we've discussed before, this system will provide the Australian defense force with leading-edge integrated air and missile defense capability using next-generation technologies to combat high-speed threats and establish Australia's integrated air and missile defense as one of the most highly advanced in the world. We also continued to demonstrate 21st Century security in other innovative ways. In May, our Skunk Works Tactical artificial intelligence team successfully executed their second set of flight tests with the University of Iowa's, Operator Performance Laboratory. RAI flew an L29 jet aircraft by means of heading, speed and altitude command sent directly to the onboard autopilot than to the plans flight controls. This test has shown our AI team can rapidly develop, iterate and integrate artificial intelligence technology for autonomous flight operations. We're also making great progress in another leading-edge defense tech initiative, hypersonic strike, which is a critical element of deterrence in today's world. As announced by the Department of Defense in June, the US Navy and US Army completed an end-to-end all up ground flight test of a common person missile, core to the Navy's conventional prompt strike or CPS and the army's long-range hypersonic weapons programs. The test marked a major step forward for the nation's development of hypersonic systems by Lockheed Martin. Pivoting to the supply chain, we continue to explore opportunities to drive our concept of anti-fragility across the global defense industrial base. For example, we recently signed a collaborative memorandum of understanding with Ryan Mittal to work together on land, air and naval opportunities. One of our first initiatives is the new Global Mobile Artillery Rocket System or GMARS is a highly interoperable two-pod launcher system intended to fire the MLRS-based munitions. Combining these combat-proven systems will help address the growing demand for long-range rocket capabilities in Europe and elsewhere. On our PAC-3 program, international collaboration remains strong as well, including development of indigenous capabilities with the opening of a PAC-3 MSE launch tube production line in Poland, as well as a memorandum of understanding with Grupo Oesi\u0301a in Spain to provide an opportunity to manufacture factory MSE parts for worldwide customers. Spain and the United States also formalized an agreement for Spain to purchase pack free MSE missiles and related support, making Spain PAC-3s 16th partner nation. I'd also like to briefly discuss the latest status of the US defense budget. The House approved their version of the FY '25 defense appropriations. So the focus now shifts to the Senate where the process continues before the reconciliation phase later this year. We believe our portfolio is well-aligned to current and future customer mission priorities, including air superiority with the F-35 and CH-53K and Black Hawk or UH-60M. Our integrated air and missile defense with PAC-3 and NGI, hypersonics with CPS and the LRHW I just mentioned a minute ago and tactical strike weapons and munitions with JASSM, LRASM, PrSM, JAVELIN and GIMLERS. Ultimately, we look forward to the conclusion of the USG appropriations process and the continued utilization of the existing supplement mental funding. On the international front, I was encouraged by conversations I had at the recent NATO Summit a few weeks ago in Washington. International partners and allies remain steadfast in their pursuit of elevated defense spending to strengthen the overall integrated deterrence posture of the alliance given the tragic and ongoing conflict in Ukraine. I'll now turn it over to Jay for award highlights and additional commentary on our financial results. Let's call it the sound of Freedom, Christine, it's good. So Kristine, I'll start and emphasize that we're going to do this unwind and conduct the deliveries with safety and quality is our number one priority. So just starting with that foundation, we actually have the ability to add resources, which have already been identified and designated. And that's test pilots, maintenance team, software and hardware engineers to get the flight test done that we need to, be at the higher end of that range. But we want to make sure that if it's weather, if it's pilot, crew rest issues, anything like that, we will accommodate for those. But we should -- we have the resources in place, I'll say, that should enable us to get to the higher end of that range, if you will. Good morning. Good morning. And Gavin, I just give you some qualitative background on demand side. Our strategy includes driving the latest digital technologies kind of through an open architecture, standard-based system to the DoD. And by doing that and making our product services platforms compliant or in line with those future concepts of open architecture and standards to pull through those products, services and platforms. So we're starting to see that already. And we're demonstrating whether it's exercises or in real conflict like the Red Sea, doing things like over-the-air updates to the AEGIS system, which is decades old, but it can be improved very quickly now just like when you download overnight on your Tesla, we can do a download overnight over the air on the AEGIS radar and combat control system and double, triple the effectiveness against things like low flying drones and cruise missiles. So we're actually implementing those kinds of things on a standard base architecture into our products and services today, which I expect will continue to pull them through. And Pete, it's Jim. Again, on a qualitative perspective, I tell our teams and our executives internally we're in the aerospace and defense industry, but we're in the deterrence business. right? So if you step back and say what contributes to deterrence from an MFC, for example? And I think anybody that's everyone watching Clint Eastwood would movie will know that, if we run out of ammunition, you're in a lot of trouble, right? So part of deterrence is showing that, a, you have enough ammunition stocks to prevail and sustain your operations from an aggressor. That's the first thing. Second thing is you also \u2013 it's helpful to demonstrate that you can produce at rate and ramp that rate quickly. That's our anti-fragility program. And the third piece of it is you can produce and repair MFC and other products in the local theater and not have to bring them all the way back to the US to fix them or drive that production up. That's the third part of our strategy. So everything we do is based on deterrents and strengthening that. And MSC has a huge role in making sure that adversaries know that we've got enough stocks in MFC type products, and we can ramp that rate and we can produce in different places and repair in different places should they act. And that's really kind of a qualitative underpinning of what Jay was talking about. Thank you. Sure, Ken. It's Jim here. So when it comes to NGAD as a program, we're not authorized an industry to speak to the details of that. So you'd have go to the U.S. government to get insight into that particular program. But I can tell you what we're doing to prepare for the next-generation combat aircraft. So on the investment front, since 1920 -- or 2021 rather, we opened the gates on four high-tech facilities that have the clearance -- the security clearance capability to produce NGAD type components, let's call them, all right? One of them is in Florida, Skunk Works in California, opened a new major factory that I was there to see. We have it in Alabama, two in Georgia. So we have these accredited facilities up and running ahead of the demand, and we're working on programs and products in that classified capability space. So we've already got these facilities up and running. The other resource we have is human in Skunk Works, Marietta and in Fort Worth and other places that can design, test and build using our digital transformation engineering technologies and the digital twin these kind of components, aircraft and others that might go into a NGAD concept. So I can just tell you that Lockheed Martin is ready to produce. We're ready to design. We're ready to build. We are in the process of making sure we're capable in the arenas that the Air Force and the Navy are going to need us to be. So that's really all we can say about that. But I can assure you that we are competitive and ready to go in this space if and when the government pulls a trigger on a real competition and want somebody will be able to produce, we can do it. So we got together, Rob, as I mentioned a few minutes ago in the prepared remarks in Fort Worth about a month with the CEOs of half of those companies that contribute to this in a significant way. We communicated the importance of exactly what you're speaking to which is not just a core processor, but there's a range and a number of other components across all of these companies that need to maintain or increase their production rates and modernize their equipment along the way. And so that communication of those suppliers has been made. They know our plans were well integrated -- more integrated than we ever have, I think, when it comes to test and planning and design iterative software across multiple companies, et cetera. So we're in a position, and as suppliers are telling us they will meet the demand. We will monitor them and continue to even put people in their sights when we need to, to make sure that happens. But we've got the major suppliers together, and they understand the demand rate, quality level we need and a better integration plan for test and development that we have built going forward. So you're right, Rob, that this is designed for backward integration, if you will. There'll be a schedule that the US government. It comes up with for TR-3. There may be -- it will be up to them as to the cadence, the investment rate, et cetera. But over a period of time, there will be a great number of originally built TR-2 aircraft that will get converted. There's some hardware software upgrades to that. Yes. So again, this is a US government policy decision, so it's better to request that kind of commentary from them, Rob. But we're, again, ready to do it at the rate that we expect -- that they come at us with. Thank you. Good morning. So Jason, I would say that there's a wide range of lessons from the Ukraine conflict unfortunately, as it is, but there's learning from it. One is that traditional system, if you will, like Javelin, at the initial invasion, made a significant contribution to the initial defense of Ukraine because it was a classic armor attack and armor-supported infantry attack, meaning there were armored vehicles that were spearheading the drive to Kiev.

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. Similar to last quarter, I'll provide an overview of consolidated financials and touch on a handful of operational items before handing off to Maria, who will cover business area financials, and then I'll come back to discuss the updated outlook. Starting on chart 4. The positive momentum we had to begin the year continued into the second quarter with sales up 9% to over $18 billion, led by RMS and MFC. As Jim mentioned, throughput remained strong reflecting an improving supply chain and internal operating cadence. Segment operating profit of $2 billion was up 10% year-over-year, and consolidated margins were 11.3%. With all four business areas achieving double-digit return on sales, the first time since the third quarter of 2022. Net favorable profit adjustments in the quarter were higher than prior year and were 21% of segment operating profit, driving the stronger margins. GAAP earnings per share of $6.85 increased 3% year-over-year, driven by higher profit and lower share count, partially offset by severance impairment charges at RMS and Sikorsky, higher interest expense and lower pension income. On the new business front, we recorded over $17 billion of orders in the second quarter for a book-to-bill ratio just below one. We generated $1.5 billion of free cash flow in the quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to just under $2.8 billion, and we continue to make the necessary investments in innovation and infrastructure to position the company and our customers for future success with $400 million -- $405 million in research and development and $370 million in capital expenditures the second quarter. Finally, we returned over 100% of our free cash flow to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Now, I'll touch on a few business activities in more detail. The order strength continued at MFC with a book-to-bill over two in the quarter, led by the $4 billion plus Army award spanning multiyear PAC-3 delivery requirements and supporting our production ramp projections. And Poland officials signed a letter of acceptance to purchase 400 JASSM ERs, the largest international order and program history, providing another ally with the latest generation JASSM variant. At Sikorsky, its platforms remain in high demand as the US State Department announced approval for four foreign military sales of Black Hawk to Austria, Brazil and Sweden. This opens the door to the potential sale of 36 Black Hawks, adding 12 helicopters each to each country's existing Blackhawk fleet. In addition, the government of Greece signed a letter of offer and acceptance for 35 UH-60M BLACK HAWK helicopters. These upgraded aircraft will support the Hellenic Ministry of Defense's ongoing modernization. It will serve as a dependable multi-role helicopter with unmatched interoperability to support vital national and allied security missions. In the space domain, late last month, NASA selected Lockheed Martin to develop and build the nation's next-generation weather satellite constellation for NOAA known as Geostationary Extended Observations, or GeoXO. This award builds on our prior work with environmental sensing technologies, which recently culminated with the launch of GOES-U, which will leverage advanced instruments and rapid updates to provide crucial data for weather forecasting, severe storm tracking and climate monitoring. Let me stop here and hand it over to Maria to get into the business area of financial detail. All right. Thanks Maria and let's shift over to the outlook on Chart 9. Given our strong year-to-date performance, sustained back position, and improving visibility into key programs, we're raising our expectations for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook for sales, segment operating profit, and earnings per share. We're increasing sales by $1.75 billion at the midpoint and tightening the range to $70.5 billion to $71.5 billion. The new midpoint reflects a solid 5% growth from 2023 with increases across all four business areas. We're also increasing segment operating profit expectation based on the higher sales with the new range of $7.35 billion to $7.5 billion and anticipate consolidated segment operating profit margins to remain at 10.5%. Business area margins remained consistent with our prior guidance at Aero and MFC, while RMS is down about 50 basis points at the midpoint and space is up 40 basis points at the midpoint. The RMS reduction is driven by Sikorsky as the business faces continued cost pressure and absorption headwinds, the impact of which have exceeded benefits from its cost reduction programs. Conversely, space is benefiting from solid performance and proactive reduction efforts. Moving to earnings per share on Chart 11. We're increasing the midpoint by $0.35 to $26.35 with a range of $26.10 to $26.60 for the full year. Primary drivers of the change are shown on this chart with increases coming from incremental profit of $0.49 and other below-the-line items of $0.13. Partially offsetting those items are the RMS charges totaling $0.29 and from the severance actions and the asset write-downs taken in the second quarter. As Jim mentioned, we're encouraged by the F-35 delivery restart and continuous progress being made towards delivering full combat capability. We're holding our free cash flow expectation in the range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion, which absorbs a potential unfavorable impact from longer deferrals of final F-35 delivery payments. This is made possible by proactive actions taken across the company to offset these potential headwinds. On the cash deployment side, we still expect over $3 billion of IR&D and capital investments, while the dividend, along with the expected $4 billion of share repurchases, maintain attractive shareholder returns. Lastly, on backlog, we continue to expect backlog to grow in 2024 even with the higher sales outlook, which provides a line of sight to future growth. Before I wrap, I'd like to highlight a few other key assumptions regarding the updated outlook. First, we expect F-35 18/19 to be awarded this year, maintaining program funding and continuity. Second, we continue to expect $325 million of losses on the MFC classified program, of which $100 million has been recognized year-to-date. And third, this outlook does not assume any pension contributions in 2024. So in summary on Chart 12, our solid first half results give us confidence in raising the full year outlook for sales, profit and EPS, while holding the cash flow outlook, reflecting our ongoing efforts to deliver predictable, and improving operating and financial performance as is expected of us. It all starts with a relentless focus on executing to our programmatic commitments and delivering critical 21st Century security mission capabilities where we strive to continuously improve. To that end, we are investing in our people, processes and systems through the 1LMX transformation, with the goal of unlocking step changes in efficiency, velocity and program execution that delivers security capabilities in ahead of ready speed to our customers. And we're confident that these management priorities and actions convert to a compelling long-term value proposition for customers and shareholders alike. With that, Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A. Yes. Let me just add, just to reiterate, Kristine, we expect anywhere between 75 to 110. Yes, with less than six months left, it is a wide range. I would say, over the next few months, we'll get much better insights into the induction and flow of aircraft going into the test and production cycle, really bringing in aircraft that are parked as well as aircraft that are coming outside of the -- from the production flow. And as we get those learnings, we'll be able to get a better assessment what the delivery requirements will be and what we expect for the year. And so it will take us a couple of months just to make sure we get that process learned out. It's well planned, but we actually have to demonstrate it in actual practice. As far as the future, from terms of reducing on the backlog of aircraft, our target is anywhere between 12 to 18 aircraft deliveries per month and really to burn down the aircraft backlog. And so that will take us a number of years here to get through that. We've already made progress so far. Since the announcement of the restart, we've delivered 10 aircraft as of Monday yesterday, six with the TR-3 configuration and four with the TR-2 configuration. So we think we're off to a very good start. But again, we really need to have a -- just to monitor the operating cadence of being able bring aircraft from two different flows into one test -- flight test flow. And again, we'll tighten that up later on in the year. Okay. Cai, let me just say, first of all, as Jim mentioned, restarting delivery was an important first step really towards delivering the fully combat capable aircraft. Aircraft, the withhold -- the aircraft withhold this final delivery payment is a timing item, as you mentioned. And we're working with the customer to finalize the terms of those final delivery payments. We're making excellent progress, but it would be immature or premature to give details of that because it remains subject to negotiation. Suffice it to say that you will see timing benefit over the next few years as we deliver, but I think we still need to work through and finalize this agreement with the customer. As far as the revenue, I really wouldn't see -- expect much of an incremental benefit in terms of revenue. We continue to build at a 156 rate. We are seeing production a little bit higher this year. But for the most part, we should expect that to be, I think, fairly stable. And yes, we'll see incremental activity in terms of test activity, which does increase penetration on a percent complete basis. But I don't really view that being all that material. And so we just hold the production. We'll expect F-35 to grow mostly from sustainment next year and in the years to come. I think it's important to mention as well that we are -- the headwind on funnel delivery payments are here in 2024. We're holding our outlook, so we're absorbing that with better performance in the rest of the portfolio. Yes, we will see the timing benefits downstream. But as I mentioned before, we have to get just the whole delivery cadence straight. And I just want to make sure I had it straight in terms of the last question. We're targeting anywhere between 12 to 18 months to fully deliver on these parked aircraft. And as I mentioned, we just need to learn out the process over the next few months here and get -- to be able to give better guidance on that. Yes. No, I appreciate the question. We've said over the last few months and really the last year or so that our goal has been to increase absolute free cash flow in the low single-digit clip, and then that augmented with share repurchase would get us to a mid-single-digit free cash flow per share expectation. That remains of the outlook. We'll go through our multiyear forecast over the next few months here, we'll be able to give you a better update in the October timeframe. I think given the fact that we're at a higher level in 2024 is a positive, and we continue to expect to grow in 2025 off this higher baseline. So, that in and of itself should result in a higher cash flow baseline as well. But there's a lot of work to be done between now and then. And so I would like to have the benefit of going through that in more detail, and we'll update that to you at least preliminarily in October. Well, I'd say it's a combination of both. We ended the year in 2023 with a $160 billion backlog, which was a record. We ended here in the second quarter at $158 billion was slightly below where it ended a record with significantly higher sales than we thought through the first half of the year. We expect -- our continue -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, that we continue to expect the backlog to increase at end of this year, which gives us more visibility into further growth in 2025 and beyond. So, we're very bullish on where that stands from a backlog standpoint. As far as supply chain, we did see improvement. We are seeing continued improvement there and on-time delivery. The part shortages continue to come down. Having said that, there are still areas where we're -- particularly where we're ramping up some of our major programs where we still have some work to be done there. And we're still going through many of the initiatives and actions that -- proactive actions that we've talked about in the past, which is some in-sourcing on some capabilities, dual sourcing, where it makes sense. Also, we have deployed, and we continue to deploy personnel to provide on-site assistance at our suppliers. And of course, we also continue to look at product redesign. But I'd say, by and large, we are seeing an improvement in the in the supply chain, which also gives us confidence for that continued growth in the future. Sure. I mean there's still plenty of runway in orders at MFC. As I mentioned, the book-to-bill in the quarter was above 2%, and we're still expecting additional orders at the end of the year, particularly in JASSM/LRASM in second half here. They're still even under supplemental, there's some opportunity there to continue to build their backlog and so we've talked about $750 million. You're right. They're going to be above that this year. We see continued growth there next year, and they're going to be, again, the highest grower within Lockheed Martin for the next three to five years. So we're pretty bullish on that. Much of that is already in the backlog, but there's still plenty more to come in terms of build -- continuing to build that backlog. The key for us is to make sure that we can meet the demand and ramp up all these programs to our customers' requirements. And the team has been laser-focused on making sure they can do that, and you're seeing the benefits of that this year with the sales coming in higher. So again, we keep our head down, continue to deliver. The demand is both domestic and international at MFC. And again, they're going to be a significant source of growth for Lockheed Martin or for the next three to five years. Yeah. It's a good question, Seth. And as I mentioned before, we're going -- just going through our process to lay out our multiyear outlook, including 2025 here over the next few months. What I would tell you is that the backlog visibility that we have would support another year similar to 2024. We have to have to go through though, and the operational. The practical operational capability to deliver that is something we go through. And so the demand is there. We have to make sure the supply can meet that as well. That's a pretty significant step change over really a two-year span on some of these ramp programs that we're dealing with. And as I mentioned before, we're still dealing with some programs that are still working through trying to get off to the ramp rates. Yeah. The second half of the year, Sheila, is -- I mean the most significant would be the program loss at MFC that we have to record in the second half. So as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we recorded about $100 million here year-to-date. In the second half, we expect about another $225 million. So that will put pressure on margins in back half. The second piece I would say is that, we would have -- even though we had a very strong and solid profit adjustment first half that slows down a little bit in the back half of the year just based on program timing, the timing of risk retirements -- and so just the risk retirements and profit adjustments are not all linear, they incur different aspects of a program life cycle. But what I would say is we feel comfortable with where we're headed. We've talked about 2024 being a low watermark for all net-net margins, and we expect it to improve gradually over the next few years, and we still feel confident that can take place. All right. Yes. So on CAS recovery, this year, we're a little bit under, say, $1.7 billion. We expect that to step down by -- in the range of about $100 million and probably stay at that level for the next few years after that. As far as absolute free cash flow in terms of the buildup and components to being able to continue grow, yes, we've talked about pension being a headwind. We've talked about being in the range of about $1 billion. The areas that we expect to drive cash flow growth would be continued earnings growth as you discussed their net income growth, in addition to some of these benefits and the timing on the F-35. We've talked also about just working capital in general. And even when you put F-35 aside, what we're looking at and going after is our contract asset. If you look here in the second quarter, that was a nearly $14 billion balance that we had net represented in a range and I'll put that in terms of efficiency around 70, 72 days of sales running through the balance at the moment. Since 2020 or so, that's grown from about 55 days. So there's an element of there kind of the F-35 and what we've gone through over the past couple of years here, but there's also been growth outside of the F-35 that represents a lot of opportunity for us to convert into faster billings at a level that we've been we've been able to demonstrate in the past. And that's what focused with on all of the business areas in terms of driving that on a multiyear basis back down to what we've been able to demonstrate. The next thing I'll say, so besides working capital and contract assets that are biggest opportunity is the reduction of payments related to the tax R&D capitalization. So we'll get in the range, I'd say, about $150 million of benefit just through lower payments there. So when you bring all these things together, we think that they generate a path to overcome what we're seeing in the pension and drive us to this target of low single digit. It's not easy. It's not a slam dunk, but we've got a path to be able to do that, and that's what we're driving today to be able deliver next year and beyond. Sure. A lot of these agreements enable -- they're part of in-country requirements for industrial cooperation. You mentioned Poland, you mentioned Germany, also Australia. And those are enablers for us to build up this backlog and drive this demand. On the PAC-3 specifically, we expect to get to $550 million in 2025, and then to $650 million by 2027. And so all of these orders and these partnerships that we're signing up, while all enablers to us to be able produce and deliver at those rates. And it's not just PAC-3. We've talked about GMLRS going from 10,000 to 14,000. We've talked about Javelin going from 2000 to about 4,000. We've talked JASSM and LRASM going from about 700 a year to 1,100 a year, so all of these orders that we're seeing, all these customer engagements that we have both domestic and international are all enablers to drive to these rates that we're building to. And so what they do is fill in the bucket to bring us to that backlog that's necessary for us to generate those sales. And we're on track to that."

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Jim.\nJim Taiclet: Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'd like to begin today's discussion with a brief overview of our quarterly financial results, the state of the U.S. Department of Defense budget, status updates on some key programs, and recent advancements made to support our vision of 21st Century security that integrates the latest digital technologies. Then Jay and Maria will provide more detailed information about quarterly highlights and financials. The increasingly unstable geopolitical environment in the world today makes it essential for industry and government to strengthen our nation's capabilities to deter and defend against further aggressive behavior against the U.S. and our allies. We here at Lockheed Martin are continuing to invest heavily to improve our design and production capabilities, while actively partnering with leading companies inside and outside the A&D industry to incorporate a wide range of technologies. As a result, we delivered robust revenue growth across the company, and we maintained a robust backlog of $159 billion, reflecting alignment between our advanced technology solutions and our customers' key missions and priorities. These first quarter results reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve the full year financial expectations we shared in the most recent earnings call. Moreover, the approved FY2024 defense budget reflected many positives for Lockheed Martin, consistent with national defense strategy priorities too. Highlights include robust funding for munitions multi-year procurement, continued investment in hypersonics and classified activities, and ongoing support for programs such as Black Hawk, CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, the fleet ballistic missile, C-130, and F-35. There were also additions to the original budget submission, including F-35 aircraft, C-130, and combat rescue helicopters. The initial budget request for FY2025, while still very early in the process, continues support of many of these same major programs, including the F-35, CH-53K, UH-60M and others. In addition to emphasis on advanced munitions programs such as JASSM, LRASM, PrSM, Javelin, Daimler, and PAC-3, as well as hypersonic conventional prompt strike and the long range hypersonic weapon. In addition to that, next-generation interceptor is getting support, which I'll address more in a moment. In this week, funding of $95 billion for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific security supplementals passed the House and is currently under consideration in the Senate. We expect FY2025 Presidential Budget request and additive supplemental funding will provide a strong underpinning for future growth over the next several years for our company, giving us further confidence in our long range plan. While demand for these key programs remains elevated, it is also essential that our program performance in terms of quality, safety, cost and schedule gets and stays at the highest level. On our most significant programs, I, Jay, and my senior executive team are personally and directly involved. On F-35, we remain focused on program execution in terms of concurrent development, production and sustainment, and we are bringing all relevant resources across our company and collaborating closely with our customers and suppliers to fully implement the TR-3 capabilities that everybody is looking forward to getting. These capabilities based on the new core processor, data storage unit, and pilot display will ensure that the F-35 is not only the most capable and effective fighter aircraft in the world, but it will also further advance its abilities to act as the air domain quarterback of joint all domain operations for the U.S. and its allies. We're encouraged by the solid progress made over the last few months towards resuming deliveries, including improvement in aircraft mission system capabilities and system stability as we advance from prior software versions towards a combat training capable configuration. Flight testing of this configuration is now underway and we're on a path we expect to be on with regard to maturing the system with approximately 95% of TR-3 capabilities in this flight test program. The test results to-date support our expected timeline of delivering the first TR-3 combat training capable aircraft in the third quarter and then transition to a fully combat capable aircraft in 2025. As planned, there will be continual software updates to support further capability insertions over the Block 4 program and beyond. While there were no final deliveries of F-35 jets in the first quarter, we're maintaining our production rate and continue to expect an aircraft delivery range for 2024 between 75 and 110, which requires timely receipt of the necessary hardware from TR-3 suppliers along the way. The F-35's advanced combat and interoperability capabilities continue to create strong demand for the aircraft internationally too. In the quarter, the Czech Republic became the 18th nation to join the F-35 global team with a signed letter of offer and acceptance, making it official its intent to procure 24 F-35s. In addition, the U.S. State Department approved a potential foreign military sale to Greece for up to 40 F-35s. And Singapore announced its intent to purchase eight F-35As to complement the 12 F-35Bs to which it has already previously committed. Also in the lower air domain, while we're disappointed in the cancellation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program or FARA, Sikorsky remains committed to delivering innovative and reliable aviation capabilities to our domestic and global customers. With a strong foundation of more than $20 billion in backlog, bolstered by expected and funded growth in the heavy lift CH-53K helicopter program, Sikorsky\u2019s multi-year outlook is stable. We're also encouraged by the army's renewed commitment to Black Hawk production and modernization, as well as our ability to address mission gaps with capability upgrades that leverage Lockheed Martin's broad portfolio of solutions in the lower air domain, things such as autonomy, AI, et cetera. Turning now to missile defense missions, which given recent world events are becoming more critical than ever. We continue to lead the industry. Last week, the missile defense agency or MDA selected Lockheed Martin to deliver the new homeland missile defense capability for the United States, which is called the next-generation interceptor or NGI. As the MDA's NGI prime contractor, Lockheed Martin will provide the most modern, reliable and technically advanced interceptor in the history of this system. This program was a 1LMX that's our digital transformation worn digital program meaning we embrace model-based engineering, digital tools, processes and technologies from the very, very start of this program. Now, as it continues on its path to the critical design review, integration with broader weapons system and flight tests, I'm proud of the Lockheed Martin team that enabled all of this. We were MDA's early down select before it was even on their schedule because we're so far in front to get this essential homeland defense capability off to a fast start. Earlier this quarter, the Long Range Discrimination Radar or LRDR, completed final acceptance and was officially handed over to the Missile Defense Agency in preparation for an operational capability baseline decision. And what that means is final transition to active service for that radar to help defend the country. The LRDR is a cutting edge national asset providing the benefits of both low and high frequency radars to search, track, and discriminate incoming missiles with an open system approach, enabling the customer to add incremental capabilities such as hypersonic defense. This is located up in Alaska, in the prime location, where we can sense early what any attack might look like and respond to it. What that really does, though, is create an elevated deterrence to any kind of attack like that. So it's really great to have LRDR about ready to go online. Now, both NGI and LRDR will be critical elements within the overall homeland defense mission, and they're going to be integrated into the broader defense architecture with a battle management system that we call command control, battle management and communications, or as the military calls it, C2BMC. So that's the system that's going to be used to integrate the radars, the missiles, and allow us to defend the country. In April, Lockheed Martin was selected for a potential 10-year, $4 billion follow-on C2BMC next-generation contract with the MDA, demonstrating again our leadership position and battle management systems for homeland defense. Under this contract, we'll continue to modernize and expand the system's capabilities to enhance global integration, improve space domain awareness, and optimize sensor connectivity and data fusion to levels never done before. All of which will create the most complete picture of these incoming threats as I just spoke about a minute ago. Separately, we also continue to advance our 21st Century security solution through collaboration with strategic commercial partners across the tech, telecom, microprocessor, and other industries to support the national defense. Citing just one example, we announced Lockheed Martin will work with Intel to support the simulated transition for Advanced Microelectronics Packaging or STAMP program for the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. This CHIPS Act related collaboration will provide a revolutionary leap in defense systems capabilities using high performance U.S. built semiconductors. Over the next 18 months, we'll integrate our latest sensor open system architecture technology with Intel semiconductors with the intent to ultimately implement, test and complete production through the U.S. Navy's Lockheed Martin MH-60 Romeo helicopter program. I'll now turn it over to Jay for more highlights and some additional commentary on our financial results. Jay?\nJay Malave: Thanks, Jim. I'll cover the consolidated results and touch on some additional highlights before handing it off to Maria, who will discuss the quarterly financials by business area, and then I'll come back to discuss the outlook and close out the remarks. Starting with chart four, we had a strong start to the year. First quarter sales of $17.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year, led by MFC and RMS. While the results benefited from an extra calendar week compared to 2023, normalized year-over-year sales growth was a solid 5%. We saw strong labor and material throughput indicative of an improving supply chain. We'll continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to enhance quality and performance proactively and, as needed, expand the breadth and depth of our engagement at supplier locations. Segment operating profit of $1.7 billion was up 4% year-over-year with margins of 10.1%, and included the anticipated $100 million reach-forward loss associated with the classified missile program at MFC. Excluding this charge, Lockheed Martin segment margins were 10.7%, primarily reflecting year-over-year lower profit adjustments. GAAP earnings per share of $6.39 were down 3% as year-over-year benefits from higher profit and lower share count were more than offset by higher interest expense, lower pension income, and mark-to-market gains. Book-to-bill in the first quarter was just below one. Notably, space booked several large national security orders in the quarter, including SDA tracking layer and other significant classified awards, contributing to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.8 and record backlog of $33 billion at space. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter after investing $360 million in research and development and $380 million in capital expenditures. Share repurchases were $1 billion and we returned $780 million through our dividend. Shifting over to additional highlights in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress we are making on the F-16 program. The first three F-16 Block 70 jets varied from Greenville, South Carolina to Bahrain in March. To-date, Lockheed Martin has produced five F-16 Block 70 jets for Bahrain with additional 11 in various stages of production and testing. We also presented the first two F-16 Block 70 aircraft to Slovakia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, underscoring the deepening partnership between the two countries. In addition, the State Department notified Congress of authorization of the sale of 40 F-16s and related upgrades and support to Turkey. The latest deal builds on our long relationship and history with the Turkish Air Force. We are confident the F-16 Block 70 and Viper upgrade package provide advanced 21st Century security capabilities with affordable operating and lifecycle costs for Turkey. We also continue to upgrade our weapon systems for longer range standoff capability. In February in the U.S., the extended range ER variant of GMLRS guided multiple launch rocket system achieved success in its first operational test. The U.S. army fired two unitary warhead ER GMLRS variants with a HIMARS launcher, demonstrating precision and advancing this capability closer to production. The U.S. army almost awarded Lockheed Martin the fourth production contract for early operating capability precision strike missiles known as PrSM. This award will allow for a significant increase in production quantities to meet army demand for long range surface missiles. And the hypersonics, following the recent end-to-end flight test, we completed the test program of the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon or ARRW with full confidence in its revolutionary capabilities. We have demonstrated successful all up round end-to-end performance on multiple occasions. ARRW provides the U.S. with the earliest air launch fully qualified production ready supersonic solution -- hypersonic solution, I'm sorry. And Lockheed Martin is prepared to quickly deliver additional tactical, operational and leave behind hypersonic strike assets that can be rapidly deployed to the U.S. military. We also continue to advance hypersonic strike capability in the land and sea domains through the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon and Conventional Prompt Strike programs. Both solutions have a full year milestones ahead as we progress towards operational capability. Shifting the integrated air and missile defense arena the AEGIS Weapon System successfully executed one of the most complicated ballistic missile defense tests in the first quarter. When the system tracked and intercepted a medium range ballistic missile amidst multiple decoys. The test employed the latest updates to the system and demonstrates the reliability of AEGIS to operate in a dynamic threat environment and we're constantly evolving the AEGIS system. This quarter, we made further progress on our efforts to integrate with PAC-3 to enable an affordable, combat proven IAMD capability for maritime engagements and expand the mission capability of our systems. I'll pause here and let me turn it over to Maria to cover the business areas.\nMaria Ricciardone: Okay. Thanks, Jay. Today, I will discuss first quarter year-over-year results for the business areas. Starting with aeronautics on chart five. First quarter sales at Aero were over $6.8 billion up 9% year-over-year, and that's 1% normalized for the extra week in 2024. The increase was primarily due to higher volumes across F-35 and Skunk Works and the continued production ramp on the F-16 program. Segment operating profit is comparable year-over-year with higher volume being offset by lower margin development contract mix and lower net profit adjustments, mainly on the F-35. Aeronautics backlog remains at a healthy $57 billion, which includes 373 F-35s and 80 C-130Js, and 132 F-16s, supporting growth into 2025 and beyond. Turning to Missiles and Fire Control on Chart 6, sales increased 25% from the prior year, 16% normalized for the extra week driven by production ramps on tactical and strike missile programs, primarily GMLRS, HIMARS and JASSM, LRASM. Integrated air and missile defense also saw higher volume on PAC-3 and THAAD. As expected, segment operating profit decreased 18% year-over-year, primarily due to the $100 million loss on the classified program Jay mentioned previously. Normalizing for the loss, MFC's margins would have been 13.7%. Now, I'd like to provide a quick update on our annual production capacity plans for key programs. PAC-3 is currently at 500 missiles, growing to 550 in 2025, and 650 by 2027. GMLRS currently is at 10,000 missiles, growing to 14,000 by 2025. JASSM, LRASM currently at about 650 missiles, growing to 1,100 by 2026, and HIMARS currently at 72 launchers, growing to 96 next year. Shifting to rotary emission systems on Chart 7. Sales increased 16% in the quarter, 8% normalized for the extra week, driven by higher volume across the entire portfolio, including radar and laser programs within integrated warfare systems and sensors, various programs within C6ISR and the CH-53K and Seahawk programs within Sikorsky. Operating profit increased 23% due to higher volume and favorable contract mix, partially offset by lower profit adjustments. Finally, with space on Chart 8, sales increased 10% year-over-year, 2% normalized for the extra week to approximately $3.3 billion. The growth was driven by higher volume on the fleet ballistic missile program and ramp ups on hypersonic and next-generation interceptor programs within strategic and missile defense, as well as higher volume on space development agency transport and tracking layer programs within national security space. Operating profit increased 16% compared to Q1 2023, driven by higher volume and ULA equity earnings, partially offset by lower net profit adjustments, primarily on the Next-Gen OPIR program. Now, I'll turn it back to Jay to wrap up our prepared remarks.\nJay Malave: Thanks, Maria. Let's turn to the outlook on Chart 9. Our expectations for Lockheed Martin\u2019s 2024 financial outlook remain unchanged from what we said in January. With the strong first quarter results positioning us well to achieve the consolidated full year outlook, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion, including over $3 billion of independent research and development and capital investments. While the dividend, along with the expected $4 billion of share repurchases, support our returns to shareholders, targeting a mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth over the longer-term. All right. To close out and summarize on Chart 10, we're off to a solid start in 2024 and remain laser-focused on execution to our customer and programmatic commitments while building momentum towards delivering our full year guidance. Through our 1LMX transformation, we are reengineering our internal processes by providing the automations and capabilities needed to drive efficiency, increase velocity and enhance key captures and programs. 1LMX will enable us to combine the depth and breadth of our portfolio with the expertise and dedication of our people to drive 21st Century Security solutions for our customers and continue to create value for our shareholders. With that Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDoug Harned: I'd like to start to make sure we have a good understanding of the F-35 right now with TR-3. As you said, the Air Force has talked about this as well, and it looks like that timeline has moved back to some point in Q3. And there's just been a great deal of slippage in the timeline over the last few years. Block 4 has been delayed, and the new budget has cut deliveries in 2025 and 2026, ostensibly to avoid having to do later Block 4 upgrades. Now, you've been able to keep production and revenues up, although deliveries and cash payments are off. But how can we get confident in the trajectory? And perhaps, Jim, maybe you could talk about what a positive or more negative scenario might look like for production and deliveries over the next two years? And what it would mean for the revenue and cash trajectory?\nJim Taiclet: Sure, Doug. So I think it's important to understand that we're doing, as I said earlier, concurrent development and production and then advancing the sustainment capability as well, all at the same time. Most of these complex programs go through a period of development and then a production run largely off of that design base or that engineered base of what the aircraft supposed to look like and how it's going to perform. The F-35 is different in a sense that development has been going on since the day the program started years and years ago, and it's going on today. Now, the good news about that is you have step function increases in capability every few years, and as a result of the F-35's capacity to do that, the government just came out and extended the expected service life of the aircraft another decade or two, I think it was. So this is a good thing, but it's also an extremely difficult thing to do and even to predict schedule, right? It's our responsibility to hold cost and schedule, but we're -- we don't control all the variables let me just say. And that's okay, we're still the OEM, we're still responsible. And so what we run into on TR-3 is just a level of complexity and executing the step function increase, that's pretty, I'd say, novel or dramatic. What the team is doing at our company is we're integrating a series of components, devices, software, and managing and integrating all of that. And so what's happening now is we are ringing out all of the software through all of the new hardware and integrating it into all the aircraft other systems. And that's taken longer than our team predicted. The way we're going to get at that is if you think of it as a release one and a release two, and we've got a lot of confidence in this stage. So release one, if you think of it that way is what we're calling along with the U.S. government, a combat training capable aircraft, meaning we can get these jets in the hands of squadron, wing, and regional commanders so that they can start training their pilots on them and training their maintenance organizations and also getting their bases and infrastructure, spare parts, pools and everything else sort of in operational shape, if you will. Once we get the final software load for the fully combat capable version of TR-3, sometime in the next few months, then those aircraft could be deployed into actual combat operations and you'll have the training, the maintenance, the ringing out, the operational patterns and procedures on how to actually fly the jet in combat. So we'd like to be able to do it sooner, but this is the schedule we're on. And I'd say for the combat training cable aircraft, we're highly confident, based on the test results so far, that those will be deliverable in the third quarter. Jay, you want to say anything else about cash flow and --\nJay Malave: Yes, sure. Doug, I'll just add, as Jim mentioned, this combat training capable -- capability and configuration, as Jim mentioned, supports the training of the squadrons standing up to new squadrons and decreasing the amount of time of the aircraft are parked. All that, what that does is really avoids any type of significant disruption. And so what this does is really keep our production on track here in 2024 and then beyond as well. As Jim mentioned, in 2025, we'll have further capability inserted and we'll actually start delivering on the inserting Block 4 type of capability as well. And you may have heard, you referenced comments made from the U.S. military and they discussed a Block 4 reimagined, and what that would entail is an insertion schedule that's really tied to an executable plan that can be provided by industry, so we can avoid these types of disruptions. And so when you look at it in the short-term, could there be pressure on the last 15 through 17 contract profitability and potential movement around in cash flow? Yes. But I think over the longer-term and the medium-term, I think we're working in coordination with our customer to make sure that we can deliver the capabilities the customer wants, but on an executable schedule. And if we're able to do that, then we should be able to keep the program on track from a production standpoint.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Strauss from Barclays. Please go ahead. I'm sorry, David. Okay, great.\nDavid Strauss: Good morning. Yes, thanks.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning, David.\nDavid Strauss: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So since Q4, we have a 2024 budget, looks like we're going to get a very large supplemental. You won NGI. How might all those things together change how you're thinking about where you kind of fall in, in the revenue guide this year and the potential for revenue growth in 2025 to accelerate kind of off this low-single-digit level?\nJim Taiclet: So David, as we mentioned, for this quarter, we started off pretty solid, just on an apples-to-apples basis 5% growth in the first quarter lines up pretty well with a mid-point guidance range, which is 2% to 2.5% and the high end of that range being, say, around 3.5%. So we're well-positioned to deliver on that expectation. It is possible somewhere to last year that we could see some upside towards the higher end of the sales guide range there. So again really good start that enables that. As we think about 2025, what you saw in the budget, what we're seeing here in supplemental, give us higher confidence that we'll continue to grow. We talked about growth in -- starting in 2023, a year earlier than we had originally anticipated, accelerating in 2024, and then giving us more confidence that we'll see at least a same if not more growth in 2025. We'll give you -- it later in the year, we'll give you a much better update in terms of what we're seeing. But right now all this bodes well to our sustained growth in terms of what we've been driving to, not only in 2025, but beyond 2025 as well.\nOperator: And the next question is from the line of Peter Arment from Baird. Please go ahead.\nPeter Arment: On missiles from fire control, can you talk maybe about the confidence in your margins -- margin guidance for the year? Just given the 1Q margin performance was certainly the lowest that we've seen in many years. And we know the classified losses are supposed to expect it to continue, but you've got kind of this reflecting top-line. I think Maria called out all the production increases and just do the losses just get smaller on the class side, or are we going to see some offsets just because of the higher volume? Maybe you just give more color on kind of your expectations on the margin performance profile going forward. Thanks.\nJay Malave: Sure. Peter, MFC was a little light because of two factors. First, as we mentioned, we did have the $100 million loss provision that we recorded. In addition to that, their profit adjustments were lighter year-over-year by about $20 million. And so that's a function really of calendarization. We'll see profit adjustments in throughout the rest of the year improve. And so getting us back to what we had guided to. Just as a reminder, we're anticipating, and that was fully anticipated in our guidance for MFC, that we would have additional or could have additional losses in the back half of the year associated with this classified program. And so what our guide, what it implies from where we are today, we reported $100 million is in a range of another $225 million in the back half of the year, which would be provided for in this expectation. Now, going beyond that, we've talked about this, and I'll just deal with the question upfront in terms of can timing change? And it's possible that we could record additional losses here in 2024 depending on other factors as the year goes on, there's factors such as technical milestone achievement through the balance of the year, discussions with our customers, visibility to funding. So all of those factors go into the determination and whether you have to recognize a loss earlier. You'll see coming out in our 10-Q that we've actually ranged the potential losses on this program, which would be in excess, additional losses in excess of $1 billion. So at least you could have an opportunity to size it. The timing of which is still to be determined. We've got about $225 million at least embedded in our guide for the balance of the year. Going back to MFC for the year, if you really take apart their expectation, the impact of this at $325 million of losses in the year anticipated, they're offsetting a fair amount of that in their guide. I mean, the impact of that is 270 basis points alone. And their total full year guide is down about 210. And so you're seeing offsetting improvement within MFC, it's not entirely one-for-one, but their underlying performance has been solid and we expect that to continue.\nJim Taiclet: And Peter, it's Jim. I used to fly these aircraft for the USAF and I can assure you that the capability that's being developed here at MFC in the classified program will have very, very long legs. There's going to be many, many years, we believe, of orders to follow. So, yes, for a quarter, for the year, maybe for a couple of years, we're going to absorb the loss provisions that Jay described. But I think if you look under the curve for the lifecycle is going to be significantly positive. And so we want to get there as efficiently as we can. This is a long run franchise program that I think the U.S. government is going to support for a very long time.\nJay Malave: Right. I think it's important to keep that in mind that, we spend a lot of time talking about timing of losses and things like that and the magnitude of it, but we also spend a lot of time internally going through just where we are in the progress of the program as well as the business case. And I can assure you the business case is accretive to it at a above our cost of capital. And as Jim mentioned, it's going to provide strong returns for many years to come.\nOperator: Our next question is from Matt Akers from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nMatt Akers: Yes. Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for the question.\nJim Taiclet: Good morning.\nMatt Akers: I want to ask a couple on the Next-Gen Interceptor win, I guess one just how you were able to win. I think ahead of when the original down flight was expected and also whenever there's sort of a big contract like this, and we always get questions on potential charges because we've seen some of that happen in the industry. So just your confidence that you've got the cost there sort of size correctly.\nJim Taiclet: So the company made a beta about three years ago to say, okay, we've got a digital transformation program that is going to take the whole company to this model-based engineering system. And that's all the way from requirements acceptance from the government to sustainment years and years down the road. And we spoke this before; it's about a $6 billion, 8 to 10-year program to convert the entire company to a model-based engineering production sustainment operation. NGI was one of the pathfinder programs picked to implement this because there's no legacy to convert, right. There's no old blueprints to try to figure out how to make three dimensional, which is something, by the way, we are doing for C-130 and other programs right now. But we could get off to the fast start on NGI because it was in this born digital category. Right from the proposal, we were using these digital technologies, 3D, CAD and everything else, and sharing data with the government in that fashion, and they were able to receive it. And we could thereby accelerate the schedule and contain the cost of the development and ultimately of the production too, by using these tools. There were three original players in this. One dropped out fairly early. The second was in kind of this final phase, if you will, of down select. And we were -- we just ready to go and provided our proposal ahead of schedule. The other player, to my knowledge, provided a proposal also. And then the government was able to make a decision based on that. But I think because of our speed and our ability to demonstrate manageable cost over time, we won, and kind of won early, if you will. I'll let Jay talk more about financials, but what I can assure you is the process of this bid did not require us to dive to the bottom on cost. So Jay, do you want to take it from there?\nJay Malave: Sure. Just a -- we're currently performing already under a contract, and that contract will continue. We've talked about this before. We've completed a preliminary design review in September of 2023. And we're on track for critical design review in 2025 and under the current contract as well as building test assets. So that will just continue under this down select. As far as pricing and costs, the current contract, because of development contracts, cost plus contract, it's low margin as you would expect, but nothing again abnormal. As far as future bidding that we provided for future types of contracts, there were various elements or different types of contract structures that the customer asked for. We provided those to the customer, none of which was based on aggressive pricing or bidding, as Jim mentioned. We've talked about this in the past, and we've taken a middle-of-the-road approach to our pricing, and this is no different.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question is from Ron Epstein from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nRon Epstein: With FARA off the table, and it looks like the flyer program has decent support, how are you thinking about the outlook for the vertical lift business? Where could we see some upside? What other competitions are out there? And how should we think about that?\nJim Taiclet: Yes. So Ron, this is Jim here. As we kind of roll into the 21st Century, what our company is trying to do is not just look at things through the programmatic lens or I'll call it vertical kind of column but also horizontally through the actual mission and figure out what technologies can accomplish the mission that will enable our core basic platforms to be successful as well. And that's how we're looking at the rotary business. It's not just at Sikorsky anymore. It is Sikorsky plus all of Lockheed Martin, right? And that's one of the reasons we're able to work with U.S. Army, Congress and the broader U.S. government to increase support for, let's say, Black Hawk, for example, in spite of the fact that FARA is being canceled and there's another vertical lift program in the form of FLRAA, which is going to be a tilt rotor. So there are missions that the Black Hawk will be extremely well suited for in the rotary lower -- it's really the lower air domain. It's not just for rotorcraft. So how do we pair those rotorcraft, a traditional Black Hawk, let's call it, by modernizing the Black Hawk with digital technology to do what the Air Force would call CCA, collaborative combat aircraft, meaning you can in the lower air domain tie drones and unmanned, uncrewed aircraft to a Black Hawk using digital technology, and we've demonstrated that already. You can actually make the Black Hawk itself autonomous with no pilots in it being flown from a command center to do high-risk missions. So we're looking at the mission and saying, what can we do all across Lockheed Martin, whether it's through sensor fusion, AI, 5G, space-based sensor assets to make the Black Hawk, for example, a much longer lived platform, a much more relevant platform and actually a very efficient platform compared to, say, the FARA aircraft that won't be able to do some of the missions anyway. So we have a strong confidence then in Sikorsky itself and the platforms that it does produce. And that includes CH-53K, which I mentioned the Seahawk, which is a Black Hawk that's configured for maritime operations that is pretty high tech as well. And so we feel really solid, as I think Jay said in his remarks, on Sikorsky's future with a backlog of $20 billion and the ability to modernize these really reliable in production aircraft to do new things and with missions in digital technology and other -- and integrate with other parts of LM and our partners to make those platforms relevant in the future. So I'll stop there. Jay, you have anything else you want to say?\nJay Malave: Sure. Just a couple of things, as Jim mentioned. A stable outlook is the best way to describe it. As Jim mentioned, CH-53K is really the pillar. And those revenues between now and 2027 and 2028 are going to double. And so while we will see declines in other programs such as combat rescue helicopter, some declines on Black Hawk and others, the CH-53K will really offset all of those declines. We do have to go through a rebalance, a little bit of a rebalance of the workforce because the mix of development work versus production work is different than what we had originally anticipated. So we'll go through that. But I think the business, as I mentioned, will be -- is pretty stable. We're also, as Jim mentioned, continue to have dialogue and just investments in Black Hawk modernization, which will maintain its relevancy particularly in the JADC2 environment. And so, of course, you continue to see opportunities for not only the base missions that Black Hawk performs but other missions as well. Those dialogues are ongoing with the army to determine what would be the best fit for those. And so as I mentioned, from a revenue standpoint over the next five years, it will actually go up over the next few years a little bit, come back down, but pretty much flat to where it is today. And so stability, I think, is the best way to describe it.\nOperator: The next question is from Rob Spingarn from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Spingarn: If we put the impact of TR-3 to the side, on the last call, you underscored the importance of the supply chain in producing F-35s at a rate of 156. And one of the things that's made the F-35 program so well supported by Congress and international countries is the breadth of the supply chain. But is the complexity and scale of the supply chain limiting the potential and affordability of the program? And on future fighter aircraft programs, whether it be NGAT or FAXX, might we expect Lockheed to do more of the work in-house, the production work in-house when compared to F-35?\nJim Taiclet: So it's a great topic, Rob. And so let's start with the origination of the F-35 program. It was intended, as you said, to be a wide-based Allied program. I think it was seven literally partners, essentially treaty partners that we all get together and contribute their industrial capacity and their financial capacity to this program, given its importance and complexity and the scale that people are contemplating. So yes, we have a pretty broad supply chain. There were a couple of times when that's gotten a little tough for the program. COVID was one of those. So we had delayed deliveries out of the UK, because the factories there weren't open, although ours were. So we will be mitigating any future programs that we have. And we're eager to have international production and sustainment partners, and we're going to expand that. But we're also going to apply some anti-fragility methodologies to those initiatives going forward. No one really thought of COVID, of course. But now that we've had that example, we need to know -- we know we need to have second and maybe third sources. And geographic diversity would be a positive thing from that perspective. So we'll just be a little more broadly thoughtful about how we do this. Having single sources outside the U.S. is probably not the best idea. There's an affordability issue around that too. So we're just going to have to balance everything out. So based on its origination and essentially the commitment of the countries to the program, we do have that sort of spread out supply chain with a couple of weak spots in it. Look, another weak spot's canopies, right? How hard is it to make a glass canopy? Well, with this kind of stress and the kind of precision that's needed and put in an F-35 canopy together versus an F-4, which I used to look out a little bit. Highly complex, hard to produce, single source, one of the big degraders that we have. So again, we're going to learn from that, whether it's a domestic or an international supplier going forward. In addition, as you pointed out, we are heavily in-sourcing when we can, and Lockheed Martin has the best technology. We're looking hard at making sure that we can control as much of the supply chain that is feasible and reasonable based on whatever program it is. And so, for example, on NGI, that was at MFC, Lockheed Martin Space collaboration to make sure that the most critical sensor components that we could produce in the company effectively and efficiently were the ones that were selected, okay? And so your topic is a really great one. We intend to actually geographically further diversify our supply chain but really based on this anti-fragility concept of having two or three sources, either different parts of the world, different companies, different logistical chains, things like that where we won't run into some supply chain issues as much as we have on some prior programs, including F-35, honestly, so.\nOperator: Next question is from Rob Stallard from Vertical Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Stallard: Jim, last quarter, you had some comments on contract structures and the way perhaps your customers have been dealing with defense industry in recent years. I was wondering if there's been any sort of resonance from your commentary and any willingness, early willingness from the customer to look at this in a fresh way.\nJim Taiclet: So let me focus on digital service contracting because I think that's a really ripe opportunity area for the DoD to work with industry, not just the traditional defense fronts, if you will, but broader industry too. We want to play on subscription basis ourselves. We want to bring in partners that will only be our suppliers on a subscription basis. So in terms of, say, 5G, connectivity services, backhaul, those kinds of things, AI, which needs constant refreshing and modeling. We will do a lot of the AI in-house, but we're not going to be possible to do all of it. We want to bring in partners. We announced a couple of them like NVIDIA and IBM. They want to work with us. So I do think we're starting to get interest inside government on how to do this. We proposed, frankly, ourselves, which will open up opportunity for a lot of other companies in different sectors an adjacent acquisition process within the DoD for digital services alongside the traditional DoD acquisition process for largely physical goods like aircraft, ships, et cetera. There's interest in that. We haven't gotten it over the line, so to speak. But I think there's a lot of advocacy across broad industry to do that and starting to be in Congress and other places in DoD as well. Along with that, we want to drive an open architecture system so that U.S. government has a lot of diversity in its potential suppliers because we're all working off of the same standards base as far as APIs, interfaces, frequencies, use and those kinds of things and synchronize that as much as we can with commercial industry so we can use more of their IP and more of their resources and more of their people. So I think that there's a lot of opportunity here, and we're getting -- starting to get some traction on it. But it's going to take a little bit of time to get those processes and those standards bodies put in place. But we're actually on it, and we have some partners and teammates agree with those.\nJay Malave: I'll just add, Rob, we have seen some changes where the contract structure is more closely aligned with the capability that's being requested and the assessment of the technology maturation of that capability. And so you're not seeing as many of these kind of high-risk fixed-price development contracts that really don't work well for anybody because they don't optimize a solution, and they typically end up poorly for the contractor. And so we have seen those changes. Again, they're case-by-case. But I can tell you that at least what we're seeing, particularly in the higher risk, higher technology-type risk arenas, we are seeing a shift in contracting to contracting vehicles that are just more relevant to those circumstances.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. And Rob, maybe to support just another minute what Jay is speaking about in a more direct way here. I have a view, as you may have heard, that having a -- even a cost-based development project or program with a fixed price set of early production options is a tough thing to intellectually get at least my arms around, which is committing to cost and price on an object that really hasn't been fully invented yet. And we're looking really, really hard if that's -- in any opportunity that's presented to us in that context as a company. So that is one area where to, again, highlight what Jay is speaking about, more of an alignment of what can industry deliver on a reasonable risk basis. And so the government can get a successful program out of it, frankly, and not have massive write-offs in industry or cost overruns or long schedule delays. We think it's constructive to get some more of that alignment that Jay described.\nOperator: Our next question is from George Shapiro from Shapiro Research. Please go ahead.\nGeorge Shapiro: Yes. Good morning. A couple of quick one's for you, Jay. If the first quarter normalized growth was 5%, and even at the high end, you're looking for 3.5%. So will this be the fastest-growing quarter? And what slows down and obviously normalizing for the fourth quarter? And then, the second question is the guide for other net was $400 million. First quarter is only negative 61. So I was expecting you might lower that number for the year. And so what was the reason why you didn't lower it? Thanks.\nJim Taiclet: Jay?\nJay Malave: All right, George. Thank you. On the quarterly profile for sales, as you mentioned, on a normalized basis, 5% growth here in the first quarter. I'd see it will slow down to low-single-digit in the second and third. And we're thinking that the fourth quarter probably flattish to maybe slightly down. You might recall that the fourth quarter of 2023 ended up being stronger than we were originally expecting. And so our compare in the fourth quarter of this year would be a little bit tougher. And so you're talking in second and third quarters probably 2% to 3% type of growth numbers with a flattish year-over-year in the fourth quarter. As far as other net, George, you got me there. There's probably some opportunity in there. We'll calibrate that, and we'll update the guide in the second quarter for the full year. But it's probably more prudent to just wait till we're halfway through the year and just make an assessment of the entire outlook, and we'll just leave it there.\nOperator: And our next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nNoah Poponak: You talked about Pentagon terms of trade and contract structure here, and you mentioned NGI as cost plus development. But you also mentioned they asked for -- to kind of see multiple contract structures. Curious what they asked to see, where you landed on those maybe interim windows between development and production. And then, Jay, the loss-making classified program in MFC, what year do you expect that to be profitable on an annual basis? And just to confirm, there's one program in that position, correct, not more than one?\nJay Malave: Yes, that's correct, Noah, just one program. And I think right now, our outlook would say probably in -- if you're -- probably 2028 is where we would expect that to flip to positive. Again, it's a question of the timing of the recognition of the losses, but if you assume kind of more linear approach from here on out to be about 2028. As far as NGI, just again, the different contracting vehicles are ranging anywhere from cost plus to fixed price incentive. There is no -- the customer hasn't selected exactly which vehicle wants to pursue. So there's nothing actually under contract for the next phase or phases. Right now, we're going to continue to perform under the current contract, as I mentioned. We got critical design review in 2025. We also, as part of this contract, we have to provide some test assets. And between now and then, I'm sure we'll have discussions in terms of getting future phases on contract.\nJim Taiclet: Yes. And Noah, the principle behind what Jay and I are speaking to here is that we want to be agnostic ultimately from a risk-adjusted basis on whatever contract format that the government would like to employ in these matters. So if it's going to be any kind of, I'll say, a highest risk would be again, fixed price production on something that's not been designed yet. We will put a high risk premium in the future and have on those kinds of requests of the government. And what's interesting is they're asking for multiple types on NGI. And that's going to give them an opportunity to see what contract risk transfer to industry is now going to cost, at least in Lockheed Martin's case because we will reply on that basis to say, if you want us to have this kind of contract, we have to have a risk premium that's significantly higher than, let's just say, a pure cost-based contract to give you the greatest contrast. And that's just the principle we're going to use from now on. So if you want a certain price point as government, we will provide you a contract format that will get you that price. But if you want to shift more risk to industry, you'll see a higher risk premium come back in our proposal, if you will. So that's the principle we're using and that we'll continue to use.\nMaria Ricciardone: Lois, I think we have time for one more question since we're close to the top of the hour. So let's take one more, and then we'll be done.\nOperator: Thank you. And next question will come from Rich Safran from Seaport Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nRich Safran: Good morning, thanks. Two-part -- quick two-part question on C2BMC. I want to know if you could discuss the P&L impact in terms of timing and margins. Second and more broadly, I thought you might discuss a bit about how this fits with the -- with your strategy for pulling in mission-centric programs and what the opportunity set there is?\nJay Malave: Okay. For timing, we're -- we've been under contract. This is a follow-on for us. And what I could do, Rich is I don't recall off-hand exactly what the annual revenues are, but I got Maria follow-up on you. But this is, again, just a continuation of those activities there. And so no significant change I don't think from a revenue standpoint or margin expectation at RMS for this.\nJim Taiclet: And so from the mission-centric approach, this is actually a pretty good example of that, Rich, in pulling through or extending existing programs, right? And so we're trying to show is that you can map data flows through a full mission, right, which generally includes and now cyber, by the way, upfront. So you have a cyber-track, then you have to have a sensing capability. You then have to have a way to get sensor data, whether it comes from a satellite or a submarine back into the command and control system. Along with that, you have to have targeting and tracking quality data that comes from beyond just the sensing of an object that's a target. You have to be able to track the target in a way that you can then guide a projectile to it and take it out or put a cyber-attack against it or laser or whatever the effector will be. And so the term of art for that is not pretty. It's called a kill chain. We want to put these chains together in diverse ways that are, again, anti-fragile, which means if you take out one link in that chain, you don't eliminate your ability to complete the mission. And so that's where we're looking at data flows in addition to physical flows, if you will, right? And if we can help create an open architecture system that can provide multiple routes of data flows that can affect missions, then we will be able to have a head start on our platforms and designing to those. And that's what we're doing with Black Hawk for example. That's what we're doing using the C2BMC system. The LRDR radar and ultimately, the NGI missile will be based on a similar architecture. We'd like that architecture to be common outside of Lockheed Martin as well as inside because that will open up more suppliers to us and also provide the government more competitive options. So this is all coming together, and I'm kind of glad you asked the question here at the end because it's very intentional.\nJim Taiclet: Okay. Thanks, Maria. Thanks, everybody, on the call. I want to also express my appreciation to everybody at Lockheed Martin for their relentless focus on this operational execution I mentioned, driving innovation and excellence. And we're all doing this in support of our customers. That's the reason. We have a vision for 21st Century security that we think will keep deterrence high in an increasingly complex and threatening global environment. As a company, we have a strong backlog, as you heard. We're driving operating discipline across the whole organization and this continuous improvement mindset we have. So all that's designed to position our company for U.S. shareholders for future growth and attractive and reliable returns to shareholders over a long period of time. So thank you all again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. Lois that concludes our call. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Teleconference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jim Taiclet",
            "content": "Thanks, Maria. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2024 earnings call. I'd like to begin today's discussion with a brief overview of our quarterly financial results, the state of the U.S. Department of Defense budget, status updates on some key programs, and recent advancements made to support our vision of 21st Century security that integrates the latest digital technologies. Then Jay and Maria will provide more detailed information about quarterly highlights and financials. The increasingly unstable geopolitical environment in the world today makes it essential for industry and government to strengthen our nation's capabilities to deter and defend against further aggressive behavior against the U.S. and our allies. We here at Lockheed Martin are continuing to invest heavily to improve our design and production capabilities, while actively partnering with leading companies inside and outside the A&D industry to incorporate a wide range of technologies. As a result, we delivered robust revenue growth across the company, and we maintained a robust backlog of $159 billion, reflecting alignment between our advanced technology solutions and our customers' key missions and priorities. These first quarter results reinforce our confidence in our ability to achieve the full year financial expectations we shared in the most recent earnings call. Moreover, the approved FY2024 defense budget reflected many positives for Lockheed Martin, consistent with national defense strategy priorities too. Highlights include robust funding for munitions multi-year procurement, continued investment in hypersonics and classified activities, and ongoing support for programs such as Black Hawk, CH-53K heavy lift helicopter, the fleet ballistic missile, C-130, and F-35. There were also additions to the original budget submission, including F-35 aircraft, C-130, and combat rescue helicopters. The initial budget request for FY2025, while still very early in the process, continues support of many of these same major programs, including the F-35, CH-53K, UH-60M and others. In addition to emphasis on advanced munitions programs such as JASSM, LRASM, PrSM, Javelin, Daimler, and PAC-3, as well as hypersonic conventional prompt strike and the long range hypersonic weapon. In addition to that, next-generation interceptor is getting support, which I'll address more in a moment. In this week, funding of $95 billion for Ukraine, Israel and Indo-Pacific security supplementals passed the House and is currently under consideration in the Senate. We expect FY2025 Presidential Budget request and additive supplemental funding will provide a strong underpinning for future growth over the next several years for our company, giving us further confidence in our long range plan. While demand for these key programs remains elevated, it is also essential that our program performance in terms of quality, safety, cost and schedule gets and stays at the highest level. On our most significant programs, I, Jay, and my senior executive team are personally and directly involved. On F-35, we remain focused on program execution in terms of concurrent development, production and sustainment, and we are bringing all relevant resources across our company and collaborating closely with our customers and suppliers to fully implement the TR-3 capabilities that everybody is looking forward to getting. These capabilities based on the new core processor, data storage unit, and pilot display will ensure that the F-35 is not only the most capable and effective fighter aircraft in the world, but it will also further advance its abilities to act as the air domain quarterback of joint all domain operations for the U.S. and its allies. We're encouraged by the solid progress made over the last few months towards resuming deliveries, including improvement in aircraft mission system capabilities and system stability as we advance from prior software versions towards a combat training capable configuration. Flight testing of this configuration is now underway and we're on a path we expect to be on with regard to maturing the system with approximately 95% of TR-3 capabilities in this flight test program. The test results to-date support our expected timeline of delivering the first TR-3 combat training capable aircraft in the third quarter and then transition to a fully combat capable aircraft in 2025. As planned, there will be continual software updates to support further capability insertions over the Block 4 program and beyond. While there were no final deliveries of F-35 jets in the first quarter, we're maintaining our production rate and continue to expect an aircraft delivery range for 2024 between 75 and 110, which requires timely receipt of the necessary hardware from TR-3 suppliers along the way. The F-35's advanced combat and interoperability capabilities continue to create strong demand for the aircraft internationally too. In the quarter, the Czech Republic became the 18th nation to join the F-35 global team with a signed letter of offer and acceptance, making it official its intent to procure 24 F-35s. In addition, the U.S. State Department approved a potential foreign military sale to Greece for up to 40 F-35s. And Singapore announced its intent to purchase eight F-35As to complement the 12 F-35Bs to which it has already previously committed. Also in the lower air domain, while we're disappointed in the cancellation of the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft program or FARA, Sikorsky remains committed to delivering innovative and reliable aviation capabilities to our domestic and global customers. With a strong foundation of more than $20 billion in backlog, bolstered by expected and funded growth in the heavy lift CH-53K helicopter program, Sikorsky's multi-year outlook is stable. We're also encouraged by the army's renewed commitment to Black Hawk production and modernization, as well as our ability to address mission gaps with capability upgrades that leverage Lockheed Martin's broad portfolio of solutions in the lower air domain, things such as autonomy, AI, et cetera. Turning now to missile defense missions, which given recent world events are becoming more critical than ever. We continue to lead the industry. Last week, the missile defense agency or MDA selected Lockheed Martin to deliver the new homeland missile defense capability for the United States, which is called the next-generation interceptor or NGI. As the MDA's NGI prime contractor, Lockheed Martin will provide the most modern, reliable and technically advanced interceptor in the history of this system. This program was a 1LMX that's our digital transformation worn digital program meaning we embrace model-based engineering, digital tools, processes and technologies from the very, very start of this program. Now, as it continues on its path to the critical design review, integration with broader weapons system and flight tests, I'm proud of the Lockheed Martin team that enabled all of this. We were MDA's early down select before it was even on their schedule because we're so far in front to get this essential homeland defense capability off to a fast start. Earlier this quarter, the Long Range Discrimination Radar or LRDR, completed final acceptance and was officially handed over to the Missile Defense Agency in preparation for an operational capability baseline decision. And what that means is final transition to active service for that radar to help defend the country. The LRDR is a cutting edge national asset providing the benefits of both low and high frequency radars to search, track, and discriminate incoming missiles with an open system approach, enabling the customer to add incremental capabilities such as hypersonic defense. This is located up in Alaska, in the prime location, where we can sense early what any attack might look like and respond to it. What that really does, though, is create an elevated deterrence to any kind of attack like that. So it's really great to have LRDR about ready to go online. Now, both NGI and LRDR will be critical elements within the overall homeland defense mission, and they're going to be integrated into the broader defense architecture with a battle management system that we call command control, battle management and communications, or as the military calls it, C2BMC. So that's the system that's going to be used to integrate the radars, the missiles, and allow us to defend the country. In April, Lockheed Martin was selected for a potential 10-year, $4 billion follow-on C2BMC next-generation contract with the MDA, demonstrating again our leadership position and battle management systems for homeland defense. Under this contract, we'll continue to modernize and expand the system's capabilities to enhance global integration, improve space domain awareness, and optimize sensor connectivity and data fusion to levels never done before. All of which will create the most complete picture of these incoming threats as I just spoke about a minute ago. Separately, we also continue to advance our 21st Century security solution through collaboration with strategic commercial partners across the tech, telecom, microprocessor, and other industries to support the national defense. Citing just one example, we announced Lockheed Martin will work with Intel to support the simulated transition for Advanced Microelectronics Packaging or STAMP program for the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering. This CHIPS Act related collaboration will provide a revolutionary leap in defense systems capabilities using high performance U.S. built semiconductors. Over the next 18 months, we'll integrate our latest sensor open system architecture technology with Intel semiconductors with the intent to ultimately implement, test and complete production through the U.S. Navy's Lockheed Martin MH-60 Romeo helicopter program. I'll now turn it over to Jay for more highlights and some additional commentary on our financial results. Jay? Sure, Doug. So I think it's important to understand that we're doing, as I said earlier, concurrent development and production and then advancing the sustainment capability as well, all at the same time. Most of these complex programs go through a period of development and then a production run largely off of that design base or that engineered base of what the aircraft supposed to look like and how it's going to perform. The F-35 is different in a sense that development has been going on since the day the program started years and years ago, and it's going on today. Now, the good news about that is you have step function increases in capability every few years, and as a result of the F-35's capacity to do that, the government just came out and extended the expected service life of the aircraft another decade or two, I think it was. So this is a good thing, but it's also an extremely difficult thing to do and even to predict schedule, right? It's our responsibility to hold cost and schedule, but we're -- we don't control all the variables let me just say. And that's okay, we're still the OEM, we're still responsible. And so what we run into on TR-3 is just a level of complexity and executing the step function increase, that's pretty, I'd say, novel or dramatic. What the team is doing at our company is we're integrating a series of components, devices, software, and managing and integrating all of that. And so what's happening now is we are ringing out all of the software through all of the new hardware and integrating it into all the aircraft other systems. And that's taken longer than our team predicted. The way we're going to get at that is if you think of it as a release one and a release two, and we've got a lot of confidence in this stage. So release one, if you think of it that way is what we're calling along with the U.S. government, a combat training capable aircraft, meaning we can get these jets in the hands of squadron, wing, and regional commanders so that they can start training their pilots on them and training their maintenance organizations and also getting their bases and infrastructure, spare parts, pools and everything else sort of in operational shape, if you will. Once we get the final software load for the fully combat capable version of TR-3, sometime in the next few months, then those aircraft could be deployed into actual combat operations and you'll have the training, the maintenance, the ringing out, the operational patterns and procedures on how to actually fly the jet in combat. So we'd like to be able to do it sooner, but this is the schedule we're on. And I'd say for the combat training cable aircraft, we're highly confident, based on the test results so far, that those will be deliverable in the third quarter. Jay, you want to say anything else about cash flow and -- Good morning, David. So David, as we mentioned, for this quarter, we started off pretty solid, just on an apples-to-apples basis 5% growth in the first quarter lines up pretty well with a mid-point guidance range, which is 2% to 2.5% and the high end of that range being, say, around 3.5%. So we're well-positioned to deliver on that expectation. It is possible somewhere to last year that we could see some upside towards the higher end of the sales guide range there. So again really good start that enables that. As we think about 2025, what you saw in the budget, what we're seeing here in supplemental, give us higher confidence that we'll continue to grow. We talked about growth in -- starting in 2023, a year earlier than we had originally anticipated, accelerating in 2024, and then giving us more confidence that we'll see at least a same if not more growth in 2025. We'll give you -- it later in the year, we'll give you a much better update in terms of what we're seeing. But right now all this bodes well to our sustained growth in terms of what we've been driving to, not only in 2025, but beyond 2025 as well. And Peter, it's Jim. I used to fly these aircraft for the USAF and I can assure you that the capability that's being developed here at MFC in the classified program will have very, very long legs. There's going to be many, many years, we believe, of orders to follow. So, yes, for a quarter, for the year, maybe for a couple of years, we're going to absorb the loss provisions that Jay described. But I think if you look under the curve for the lifecycle is going to be significantly positive. And so we want to get there as efficiently as we can. This is a long run franchise program that I think the U.S. government is going to support for a very long time. Good morning. So the company made a beta about three years ago to say, okay, we've got a digital transformation program that is going to take the whole company to this model-based engineering system. And that's all the way from requirements acceptance from the government to sustainment years and years down the road. And we spoke this before; it's about a $6 billion, 8 to 10-year program to convert the entire company to a model-based engineering production sustainment operation. NGI was one of the pathfinder programs picked to implement this because there's no legacy to convert, right. There's no old blueprints to try to figure out how to make three dimensional, which is something, by the way, we are doing for C-130 and other programs right now. But we could get off to the fast start on NGI because it was in this born digital category. Right from the proposal, we were using these digital technologies, 3D, CAD and everything else, and sharing data with the government in that fashion, and they were able to receive it. And we could thereby accelerate the schedule and contain the cost of the development and ultimately of the production too, by using these tools. There were three original players in this. One dropped out fairly early. The second was in kind of this final phase, if you will, of down select. And we were -- we just ready to go and provided our proposal ahead of schedule. The other player, to my knowledge, provided a proposal also. And then the government was able to make a decision based on that. But I think because of our speed and our ability to demonstrate manageable cost over time, we won, and kind of won early, if you will. I'll let Jay talk more about financials, but what I can assure you is the process of this bid did not require us to dive to the bottom on cost. So Jay, do you want to take it from there? Yes. So Ron, this is Jim here. As we kind of roll into the 21st Century, what our company is trying to do is not just look at things through the programmatic lens or I'll call it vertical kind of column but also horizontally through the actual mission and figure out what technologies can accomplish the mission that will enable our core basic platforms to be successful as well. And that's how we're looking at the rotary business. It's not just at Sikorsky anymore. It is Sikorsky plus all of Lockheed Martin, right? And that's one of the reasons we're able to work with U.S. Army, Congress and the broader U.S. government to increase support for, let's say, Black Hawk, for example, in spite of the fact that FARA is being canceled and there's another vertical lift program in the form of FLRAA, which is going to be a tilt rotor. So there are missions that the Black Hawk will be extremely well suited for in the rotary lower -- it's really the lower air domain. It's not just for rotorcraft. So how do we pair those rotorcraft, a traditional Black Hawk, let's call it, by modernizing the Black Hawk with digital technology to do what the Air Force would call CCA, collaborative combat aircraft, meaning you can in the lower air domain tie drones and unmanned, uncrewed aircraft to a Black Hawk using digital technology, and we've demonstrated that already. You can actually make the Black Hawk itself autonomous with no pilots in it being flown from a command center to do high-risk missions. So we're looking at the mission and saying, what can we do all across Lockheed Martin, whether it's through sensor fusion, AI, 5G, space-based sensor assets to make the Black Hawk, for example, a much longer lived platform, a much more relevant platform and actually a very efficient platform compared to, say, the FARA aircraft that won't be able to do some of the missions anyway. So we have a strong confidence then in Sikorsky itself and the platforms that it does produce. And that includes CH-53K, which I mentioned the Seahawk, which is a Black Hawk that's configured for maritime operations that is pretty high tech as well. And so we feel really solid, as I think Jay said in his remarks, on Sikorsky's future with a backlog of $20 billion and the ability to modernize these really reliable in production aircraft to do new things and with missions in digital technology and other -- and integrate with other parts of LM and our partners to make those platforms relevant in the future. So I'll stop there. Jay, you have anything else you want to say? So it's a great topic, Rob. And so let's start with the origination of the F-35 program. It was intended, as you said, to be a wide-based Allied program. I think it was seven literally partners, essentially treaty partners that we all get together and contribute their industrial capacity and their financial capacity to this program, given its importance and complexity and the scale that people are contemplating. So yes, we have a pretty broad supply chain. There were a couple of times when that's gotten a little tough for the program. COVID was one of those. So we had delayed deliveries out of the UK, because the factories there weren't open, although ours were. So we will be mitigating any future programs that we have. And we're eager to have international production and sustainment partners, and we're going to expand that. But we're also going to apply some anti-fragility methodologies to those initiatives going forward. No one really thought of COVID, of course. But now that we've had that example, we need to know -- we know we need to have second and maybe third sources. And geographic diversity would be a positive thing from that perspective. So we'll just be a little more broadly thoughtful about how we do this. Having single sources outside the U.S. is probably not the best idea. There's an affordability issue around that too. So we're just going to have to balance everything out. So based on its origination and essentially the commitment of the countries to the program, we do have that sort of spread out supply chain with a couple of weak spots in it. Look, another weak spot's canopies, right? How hard is it to make a glass canopy? Well, with this kind of stress and the kind of precision that's needed and put in an F-35 canopy together versus an F-4, which I used to look out a little bit. Highly complex, hard to produce, single source, one of the big degraders that we have. So again, we're going to learn from that, whether it's a domestic or an international supplier going forward. In addition, as you pointed out, we are heavily in-sourcing when we can, and Lockheed Martin has the best technology. We're looking hard at making sure that we can control as much of the supply chain that is feasible and reasonable based on whatever program it is. And so, for example, on NGI, that was at MFC, Lockheed Martin Space collaboration to make sure that the most critical sensor components that we could produce in the company effectively and efficiently were the ones that were selected, okay? And so your topic is a really great one. We intend to actually geographically further diversify our supply chain but really based on this anti-fragility concept of having two or three sources, either different parts of the world, different companies, different logistical chains, things like that where we won't run into some supply chain issues as much as we have on some prior programs, including F-35, honestly, so. So let me focus on digital service contracting because I think that's a really ripe opportunity area for the DoD to work with industry, not just the traditional defense fronts, if you will, but broader industry too. We want to play on subscription basis ourselves. We want to bring in partners that will only be our suppliers on a subscription basis. So in terms of, say, 5G, connectivity services, backhaul, those kinds of things, AI, which needs constant refreshing and modeling. We will do a lot of the AI in-house, but we're not going to be possible to do all of it. We want to bring in partners. We announced a couple of them like NVIDIA and IBM. They want to work with us. So I do think we're starting to get interest inside government on how to do this. We proposed, frankly, ourselves, which will open up opportunity for a lot of other companies in different sectors an adjacent acquisition process within the DoD for digital services alongside the traditional DoD acquisition process for largely physical goods like aircraft, ships, et cetera. There's interest in that. We haven't gotten it over the line, so to speak. But I think there's a lot of advocacy across broad industry to do that and starting to be in Congress and other places in DoD as well. Along with that, we want to drive an open architecture system so that U.S. government has a lot of diversity in its potential suppliers because we're all working off of the same standards base as far as APIs, interfaces, frequencies, use and those kinds of things and synchronize that as much as we can with commercial industry so we can use more of their IP and more of their resources and more of their people. So I think that there's a lot of opportunity here, and we're getting -- starting to get some traction on it. But it's going to take a little bit of time to get those processes and those standards bodies put in place. But we're actually on it, and we have some partners and teammates agree with those. Yes. And Rob, maybe to support just another minute what Jay is speaking about in a more direct way here. I have a view, as you may have heard, that having a -- even a cost-based development project or program with a fixed price set of early production options is a tough thing to intellectually get at least my arms around, which is committing to cost and price on an object that really hasn't been fully invented yet. And we're looking really, really hard if that's -- in any opportunity that's presented to us in that context as a company. So that is one area where to, again, highlight what Jay is speaking about, more of an alignment of what can industry deliver on a reasonable risk basis. And so the government can get a successful program out of it, frankly, and not have massive write-offs in industry or cost overruns or long schedule delays. We think it's constructive to get some more of that alignment that Jay described. Jay? Yes. And Noah, the principle behind what Jay and I are speaking to here is that we want to be agnostic ultimately from a risk-adjusted basis on whatever contract format that the government would like to employ in these matters. So if it's going to be any kind of, I'll say, a highest risk would be again, fixed price production on something that's not been designed yet. We will put a high risk premium in the future and have on those kinds of requests of the government. And what's interesting is they're asking for multiple types on NGI. And that's going to give them an opportunity to see what contract risk transfer to industry is now going to cost, at least in Lockheed Martin's case because we will reply on that basis to say, if you want us to have this kind of contract, we have to have a risk premium that's significantly higher than, let's just say, a pure cost-based contract to give you the greatest contrast. And that's just the principle we're going to use from now on. So if you want a certain price point as government, we will provide you a contract format that will get you that price. But if you want to shift more risk to industry, you'll see a higher risk premium come back in our proposal, if you will. So that's the principle we're using and that we'll continue to use. And so from the mission-centric approach, this is actually a pretty good example of that, Rich, in pulling through or extending existing programs, right? And so we're trying to show is that you can map data flows through a full mission, right, which generally includes and now cyber, by the way, upfront. So you have a cyber-track, then you have to have a sensing capability. You then have to have a way to get sensor data, whether it comes from a satellite or a submarine back into the command and control system. Along with that, you have to have targeting and tracking quality data that comes from beyond just the sensing of an object that's a target. You have to be able to track the target in a way that you can then guide a projectile to it and take it out or put a cyber-attack against it or laser or whatever the effector will be. And so the term of art for that is not pretty. It's called a kill chain. We want to put these chains together in diverse ways that are, again, anti-fragile, which means if you take out one link in that chain, you don't eliminate your ability to complete the mission. And so that's where we're looking at data flows in addition to physical flows, if you will, right? And if we can help create an open architecture system that can provide multiple routes of data flows that can affect missions, then we will be able to have a head start on our platforms and designing to those. And that's what we're doing with Black Hawk for example. That's what we're doing using the C2BMC system. The LRDR radar and ultimately, the NGI missile will be based on a similar architecture. We'd like that architecture to be common outside of Lockheed Martin as well as inside because that will open up more suppliers to us and also provide the government more competitive options. So this is all coming together, and I'm kind of glad you asked the question here at the end because it's very intentional. Okay. Thanks, Maria. Thanks, everybody, on the call. I want to also express my appreciation to everybody at Lockheed Martin for their relentless focus on this operational execution I mentioned, driving innovation and excellence. And we're all doing this in support of our customers. That's the reason. We have a vision for 21st Century security that we think will keep deterrence high in an increasingly complex and threatening global environment. As a company, we have a strong backlog, as you heard. We're driving operating discipline across the whole organization and this continuous improvement mindset we have. So all that's designed to position our company for U.S. shareholders for future growth and attractive and reliable returns to shareholders over a long period of time. So thank you all again for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. Lois that concludes our call. Thanks."

            "name": "Jay Malave",
            "content": "Thanks, Jim. I'll cover the consolidated results and touch on some additional highlights before handing it off to Maria, who will discuss the quarterly financials by business area, and then I'll come back to discuss the outlook and close out the remarks. Starting with chart four, we had a strong start to the year. First quarter sales of $17.2 billion increased 14% year-over-year, led by MFC and RMS. While the results benefited from an extra calendar week compared to 2023, normalized year-over-year sales growth was a solid 5%. We saw strong labor and material throughput indicative of an improving supply chain. We'll continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to enhance quality and performance proactively and, as needed, expand the breadth and depth of our engagement at supplier locations. Segment operating profit of $1.7 billion was up 4% year-over-year with margins of 10.1%, and included the anticipated $100 million reach-forward loss associated with the classified missile program at MFC. Excluding this charge, Lockheed Martin segment margins were 10.7%, primarily reflecting year-over-year lower profit adjustments. GAAP earnings per share of $6.39 were down 3% as year-over-year benefits from higher profit and lower share count were more than offset by higher interest expense, lower pension income, and mark-to-market gains. Book-to-bill in the first quarter was just below one. Notably, space booked several large national security orders in the quarter, including SDA tracking layer and other significant classified awards, contributing to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.8 and record backlog of $33 billion at space. We generated $1.3 billion of free cash flow in the quarter after investing $360 million in research and development and $380 million in capital expenditures. Share repurchases were $1 billion and we returned $780 million through our dividend. Shifting over to additional highlights in the quarter. We are pleased with the progress we are making on the F-16 program. The first three F-16 Block 70 jets varied from Greenville, South Carolina to Bahrain in March. To-date, Lockheed Martin has produced five F-16 Block 70 jets for Bahrain with additional 11 in various stages of production and testing. We also presented the first two F-16 Block 70 aircraft to Slovakia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, underscoring the deepening partnership between the two countries. In addition, the State Department notified Congress of authorization of the sale of 40 F-16s and related upgrades and support to Turkey. The latest deal builds on our long relationship and history with the Turkish Air Force. We are confident the F-16 Block 70 and Viper upgrade package provide advanced 21st Century security capabilities with affordable operating and lifecycle costs for Turkey. We also continue to upgrade our weapon systems for longer range standoff capability. In February in the U.S., the extended range ER variant of GMLRS guided multiple launch rocket system achieved success in its first operational test. The U.S. army fired two unitary warhead ER GMLRS variants with a HIMARS launcher, demonstrating precision and advancing this capability closer to production. The U.S. army almost awarded Lockheed Martin the fourth production contract for early operating capability precision strike missiles known as PrSM. This award will allow for a significant increase in production quantities to meet army demand for long range surface missiles. And the hypersonics, following the recent end-to-end flight test, we completed the test program of the Air-launched Rapid Response Weapon or ARRW with full confidence in its revolutionary capabilities. We have demonstrated successful all up round end-to-end performance on multiple occasions. ARRW provides the U.S. with the earliest air launch fully qualified production ready supersonic solution -- hypersonic solution, I'm sorry. And Lockheed Martin is prepared to quickly deliver additional tactical, operational and leave behind hypersonic strike assets that can be rapidly deployed to the U.S. military. We also continue to advance hypersonic strike capability in the land and sea domains through the Long-Range Hypersonic Weapon and Conventional Prompt Strike programs. Both solutions have a full year milestones ahead as we progress towards operational capability. Shifting the integrated air and missile defense arena the AEGIS Weapon System successfully executed one of the most complicated ballistic missile defense tests in the first quarter. When the system tracked and intercepted a medium range ballistic missile amidst multiple decoys. The test employed the latest updates to the system and demonstrates the reliability of AEGIS to operate in a dynamic threat environment and we're constantly evolving the AEGIS system. This quarter, we made further progress on our efforts to integrate with PAC-3 to enable an affordable, combat proven IAMD capability for maritime engagements and expand the mission capability of our systems. I'll pause here and let me turn it over to Maria to cover the business areas. Thanks, Maria. Let's turn to the outlook on Chart 9. Our expectations for Lockheed Martin's 2024 financial outlook remain unchanged from what we said in January. With the strong first quarter results positioning us well to achieve the consolidated full year outlook, we continue to expect free cash flow to be in the range of $6 billion to $6.3 billion, including over $3 billion of independent research and development and capital investments. While the dividend, along with the expected $4 billion of share repurchases, support our returns to shareholders, targeting a mid-single-digit free cash flow per share growth over the longer-term. All right. To close out and summarize on Chart 10, we're off to a solid start in 2024 and remain laser-focused on execution to our customer and programmatic commitments while building momentum towards delivering our full year guidance. Through our 1LMX transformation, we are reengineering our internal processes by providing the automations and capabilities needed to drive efficiency, increase velocity and enhance key captures and programs. 1LMX will enable us to combine the depth and breadth of our portfolio with the expertise and dedication of our people to drive 21st Century Security solutions for our customers and continue to create value for our shareholders. With that Lois, let's open up the call for Q&A. Yes, sure. Doug, I'll just add, as Jim mentioned, this combat training capable -- capability and configuration, as Jim mentioned, supports the training of the squadrons standing up to new squadrons and decreasing the amount of time of the aircraft are parked. All that, what that does is really avoids any type of significant disruption. And so what this does is really keep our production on track here in 2024 and then beyond as well. As Jim mentioned, in 2025, we'll have further capability inserted and we'll actually start delivering on the inserting Block 4 type of capability as well. And you may have heard, you referenced comments made from the U.S. military and they discussed a Block 4 reimagined, and what that would entail is an insertion schedule that's really tied to an executable plan that can be provided by industry, so we can avoid these types of disruptions. And so when you look at it in the short-term, could there be pressure on the last 15 through 17 contract profitability and potential movement around in cash flow? Yes. But I think over the longer-term and the medium-term, I think we're working in coordination with our customer to make sure that we can deliver the capabilities the customer wants, but on an executable schedule. And if we're able to do that, then we should be able to keep the program on track from a production standpoint. Sure. Peter, MFC was a little light because of two factors. First, as we mentioned, we did have the $100 million loss provision that we recorded. In addition to that, their profit adjustments were lighter year-over-year by about $20 million. And so that's a function really of calendarization. We'll see profit adjustments in throughout the rest of the year improve. And so getting us back to what we had guided to. Just as a reminder, we're anticipating, and that was fully anticipated in our guidance for MFC, that we would have additional or could have additional losses in the back half of the year associated with this classified program. And so what our guide, what it implies from where we are today, we reported $100 million is in a range of another $225 million in the back half of the year, which would be provided for in this expectation. Now, going beyond that, we've talked about this, and I'll just deal with the question upfront in terms of can timing change? And it's possible that we could record additional losses here in 2024 depending on other factors as the year goes on, there's factors such as technical milestone achievement through the balance of the year, discussions with our customers, visibility to funding. So all of those factors go into the determination and whether you have to recognize a loss earlier. You'll see coming out in our 10-Q that we've actually ranged the potential losses on this program, which would be in excess, additional losses in excess of $1 billion. So at least you could have an opportunity to size it. The timing of which is still to be determined. We've got about $225 million at least embedded in our guide for the balance of the year. Going back to MFC for the year, if you really take apart their expectation, the impact of this at $325 million of losses in the year anticipated, they're offsetting a fair amount of that in their guide. I mean, the impact of that is 270 basis points alone. And their total full year guide is down about 210. And so you're seeing offsetting improvement within MFC, it's not entirely one-for-one, but their underlying performance has been solid and we expect that to continue. Right. I think it's important to keep that in mind that, we spend a lot of time talking about timing of losses and things like that and the magnitude of it, but we also spend a lot of time internally going through just where we are in the progress of the program as well as the business case. And I can assure you the business case is accretive to it at a above our cost of capital. And as Jim mentioned, it's going to provide strong returns for many years to come. Sure. Just a -- we're currently performing already under a contract, and that contract will continue. We've talked about this before. We've completed a preliminary design review in September of 2023. And we're on track for critical design review in 2025 and under the current contract as well as building test assets. So that will just continue under this down select. As far as pricing and costs, the current contract, because of development contracts, cost plus contract, it's low margin as you would expect, but nothing again abnormal. As far as future bidding that we provided for future types of contracts, there were various elements or different types of contract structures that the customer asked for. We provided those to the customer, none of which was based on aggressive pricing or bidding, as Jim mentioned. We've talked about this in the past, and we've taken a middle-of-the-road approach to our pricing, and this is no different. Sure. Just a couple of things, as Jim mentioned. A stable outlook is the best way to describe it. As Jim mentioned, CH-53K is really the pillar. And those revenues between now and 2027 and 2028 are going to double. And so while we will see declines in other programs such as combat rescue helicopter, some declines on Black Hawk and others, the CH-53K will really offset all of those declines. We do have to go through a rebalance, a little bit of a rebalance of the workforce because the mix of development work versus production work is different than what we had originally anticipated. So we'll go through that. But I think the business, as I mentioned, will be -- is pretty stable. We're also, as Jim mentioned, continue to have dialogue and just investments in Black Hawk modernization, which will maintain its relevancy particularly in the JADC2 environment. And so, of course, you continue to see opportunities for not only the base missions that Black Hawk performs but other missions as well. Those dialogues are ongoing with the army to determine what would be the best fit for those. And so as I mentioned, from a revenue standpoint over the next five years, it will actually go up over the next few years a little bit, come back down, but pretty much flat to where it is today. And so stability, I think, is the best way to describe it. I'll just add, Rob, we have seen some changes where the contract structure is more closely aligned with the capability that's being requested and the assessment of the technology maturation of that capability. And so you're not seeing as many of these kind of high-risk fixed-price development contracts that really don't work well for anybody because they don't optimize a solution, and they typically end up poorly for the contractor. And so we have seen those changes. Again, they're case-by-case. But I can tell you that at least what we're seeing, particularly in the higher risk, higher technology-type risk arenas, we are seeing a shift in contracting to contracting vehicles that are just more relevant to those circumstances. All right, George. Thank you. On the quarterly profile for sales, as you mentioned, on a normalized basis, 5% growth here in the first quarter. I'd see it will slow down to low-single-digit in the second and third. And we're thinking that the fourth quarter probably flattish to maybe slightly down. You might recall that the fourth quarter of 2023 ended up being stronger than we were originally expecting. And so our compare in the fourth quarter of this year would be a little bit tougher. And so you're talking in second and third quarters probably 2% to 3% type of growth numbers with a flattish year-over-year in the fourth quarter. As far as other net, George, you got me there. There's probably some opportunity in there. We'll calibrate that, and we'll update the guide in the second quarter for the full year. But it's probably more prudent to just wait till we're halfway through the year and just make an assessment of the entire outlook, and we'll just leave it there. Yes, that's correct, Noah, just one program. And I think right now, our outlook would say probably in -- if you're -- probably 2028 is where we would expect that to flip to positive. Again, it's a question of the timing of the recognition of the losses, but if you assume kind of more linear approach from here on out to be about 2028. As far as NGI, just again, the different contracting vehicles are ranging anywhere from cost plus to fixed price incentive. There is no -- the customer hasn't selected exactly which vehicle wants to pursue. So there's nothing actually under contract for the next phase or phases. Right now, we're going to continue to perform under the current contract, as I mentioned. We got critical design review in 2025. We also, as part of this contract, we have to provide some test assets. And between now and then, I'm sure we'll have discussions in terms of getting future phases on contract. Okay. For timing, we're -- we've been under contract. This is a follow-on for us. And what I could do, Rich is I don't recall off-hand exactly what the annual revenues are, but I got Maria follow-up on you. But this is, again, just a continuation of those activities there. And so no significant change I don't think from a revenue standpoint or margin expectation at RMS for this."
