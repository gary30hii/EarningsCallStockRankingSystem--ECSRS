At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Intercontinental Exchange Fourth Quarter Conference Call. All line have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Please note, this event is being recorded.\nWarren Gardiner: Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter 2020 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2020 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures, including pro-forma revenues, adjusted income, EPS, operating income, operating margin, expenses, effective tax rate and debt-to-adjusted EBITDA. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You will find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials and an explanation of why we deem this information to be meaningful, as well as how management uses these measures in our Form 10-K. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain terms. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Scott Hill, Chief Financial Officer; and Ben Jackson, our President. I'll now turn the call over to Scott.\nScott Hill: Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4, with some key highlights from 2020, and a summary of our strong fourth quarter results. Earnings per share of $4.51 were up 16% year-over-year on record revenues of over $6 billion. Free cash flow totaled a record $2.4 billion, and we returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We also use some of that cash in our strong credit profile to make the important strategic acquisition of Ellie Mae in September, an acquisition that was nearly 3% accretive to our full-year 2020 earnings per share. Our fourth quarter results were an exclamation point on a great year. Earnings per share totaled $1.13, up 19% year-over-year. Net revenues totaled approximately $1.7 billion, a 14% increase on a pro-forma basis. While we've now transitioned to new segment reporting, I'll mention that fourth quarter data services revenues totaled $595 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range and up 6% year-over-year. For the full year, despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, our data sales teams focused on serving our customers, deliver data services revenues that grew 5% over the prior year, and one of the top of our guidance entering the year.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 9, where I'll begin with some of the highlights and key initiatives across our Global Energy business. While inflation, economic growth and geopolitics will always influence volume trends in a particular quarter or year, we are focusing on investing in the structural growth opportunities that exists across Global Energy markets. Investments that have been critical to the 7% average annual revenue growth we have generated across our energy and environmental network over the last five years.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Thank you, Ben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 12. Over two years ago, and in collaboration with Starbucks and Microsoft, among others, we ceded a venture within ICE call Bakkt. Our vision was to leverage our collective core competencies to build a regulated ecosystem that would support the full lifecycle of a digital asset, and through efficiency gains and greater transparency, a platform that would have strong network effects within a nascent but rapidly growing asset class.\nOperator:  The first question comes from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Good morning, Jeff, Scott and Ben. Congrats on the great year. I guess, the question is on the recurring revenue. Thanks for the breakout and transparency on that, Scott. So I get the - I think the exchange you said at the SIP revenues, what I didn't understand is how - what's recurring in the mortgage side, and it looks like you're about - almost half year revenues recurring now overall if I have - calculated accurately?\nScott Hill: Yes, Rich, you picked up on it exactly right. We did want to continue to give transparency in our guidance on those elements of our business that are recurring, and the leisure to predict in some of the volume based business. And you're exactly right that if you add up the total of the recurring guide, it's around mid-point, $830 million of revenue, which is just less than half of the overall business. If you look at -- we've given you that detail on a pro-forma basis historically, and if you do the math on the guide in the first quarter, those recurring revenues are growing 7% to 9%. So very strong performance on a very stable part of our business right out of the gate, obviously led by a strong performance in the mortgage business, which has picked up customers, picked up volume from existing customers, but then also the data business, which again, despite the pandemic, as I said in my remarks, sales team did a remarkable job and put us in a position where ASV was nearly 6% entering this year. So we feel very good about those recurring businesses and we intend to continue to give you each quarter our perspective on what we expect those revenues to be. You asked specifically about the recurring nature of mortgage bit, so I'll let Ben give you a little color on what's driving that great performance.\nBenjamin Jackson: Hi, Rich. We saw this. So the first thing to start with is on the mortgage side of the business. When someone subscribes to come onto our network, they're getting our full platform and our network services as part of that. So there is a base level of subscription fee that someone's paying to be a part of that and that's really what that recurring revenue piece is. And when we analyze the deal, one of the exciting things that we saw under the covers here and that I've talked about in terms of the different TAMs that we can go after here with this business, out of that $10 billion TAM, $4 billion alone is just in the origination side and automating that whole origination process. And we had seen that Ellie Mae had increased market share, 38% to 44%, in a pretty short period of time, and we had conviction that they're going to continue to grow market share in that space. I'm pleased to say that under the covers what we've seen in terms of sales performance and I even highlighted this on the last quarterly earnings call, back in October, that the sales results have been phenomenal in terms of selling new versions of our loan origination system into new customers and then also cross sales of our products into the customer base. And to go into that even a little bit further, in Q3 and Q4, the company set all-time records in terms of bookings on the Encompass Loan Origination System. So Q3 and Q4 are the two highest quarters ever in the company's history. Q4 across the entire Ellie Mae product set was the largest bookings quarter ever in the company's history. So all of that are real tailwinds. Scott gave the guide to the Q1 recurring revenue for the business as well and why we feel really strong about the businesses ability to grow that recurring revenue base regardless of volume environments.\nOperator: The next question is from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, thank you. Just to follow on that mortgage discussion just now since you gave some recurring revenue guidance, et cetera. Can you just give us an update how you feel about your outlook for the full year in general? It's two-part question. One, obviously, you gave a 8% to 10% outlook that you're comfortable for 2021 you said when you closed Ellie, but that was just flatly and now you're obviously running ahead. So, one, how should we be thinking about that guidance going forward now and how should we really hold you accountable now that you obviously talking about pro forma numbers, you're integrating the business, so how should we think about it from a combined ICE plus Ellie mortgage outlook for the year? Thanks.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. So obviously, fourth quarter blew away all industry estimates in terms of volume. So you got to set that aside. And when we did this deal, we are very clear that we saw this as a long-term growth trend and that we are convinced that on an annual basis, we can grow this business and this business will grow 8% to 10% per year on average over 10 years. And underneath the covers, as I just referenced in the answer I gave to Rich, if you look under the covers of what's happened with that business since we've acquired it, sales strength has been very strong. So I mentioned a couple of the Encompass records that we saw over the last couple of quarters. Also another in that, $4 billion of the $10 billion TAM, another $4 billion of that $10 billion TAM is around data and analytics. And we also saw record sales of our AIQ platform, so record bookings of the analyzers that are automating that origination workflow in the fourth quarter. We continue to see strength across Encompass as well as AIQ in January, and we're ahead in January than where we thought we were going to be in terms of our model. What this means is that, as we're hitting these types of sales results and sales records for the company, it obviously means there's going to be more recurring revenue into the business. It means it's going to be more customers on the business. There's going to be more loans that are on the platforms that are now on our network loans that we did not interact with before. And more loans on our network interact with the third parties on the network that we have and for the efficiencies that we provide to people, ordering services like our flood report or credit report of that network, we monetize that, charge a service fee for the efficiency that we're providing. So all of these we see as significant tailwinds into the business that gives us confidence that we can grow regardless of volume environment over a long period of time with that 8% to 10% guidance.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Carrier of Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMike Carrier: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to get an update on the data outlook. And I guess, mostly on the equity side, you've just given some of the changes with the SEC on the data rule. Just wanted to see how you think about if that can impact the business, how you guys are thinking about it? Whether it's from a product standpoint, new competition coming in to the industry, I mean, how you are, let's say, to navigate?\nScott Hill: Hey, Mike. It's Scott, I'll take this, and then if Jeff wants to jump in, he can. I think your question as I understood it was looking at kind of the recurring revenues in the Exchange business, specifically exchange data, what are our expectations in terms of any revenue impact from ongoing dialog with the SEC, and the answer is none. We're in conversations about changes they discuss, but right now, we haven't seen any impact. We don't anticipate any impact. Yes, I'll tell you what I think is consistent with what we've said for probably the last two or three years, which is -- that's not a line we expect to generate a lot of growth worth, not a line that we expect going to go down much, it's just kind of be stable. And again, we've given you some history on the recurring revenue. And if you look 3Q, 4Q, the guide to 1Q that they're all, kind of, right in that same number. So there is no expectation on our end that there are any changes that are likely to impact revenue this year. We've also said in the past and I think it's still true at any changes that did come or will likely come in over the course of two, three, five years, not immediately. So the net-net answer is, no real impact expected on that bucket of revenue for us this year.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Hill of Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nKen Hill: Hey, good morning. I was hoping to go back to one of the smaller portion of the mortgage business there on data analytics. I think that run rate is about $70 million annually, but the opportunity set as you mentioned is about $4 billion of addressable market there. So I was hoping you can talk to maybe what infrastructure you are putting in place or processes you're putting in place to build that out, maybe help us with the vision for that -- there over the longer term?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Ken. This is Ben. So this is an area that we have invested heavily and the business has invested heavily in. And when we're looking at and analyzing doing and the acquisition of Ellie Mae, it's one of the areas we were absolutely most excited about. And the area of this business under data and analytics is really that AIQ business, that's an acquisition that Ellie Mae has done a few years ago. And if you look at the heart of what that business is all about and investments that we've made, it's all about automating the very manual part of the origination workflow. And we've used statistics in the past of -- they are costing around $8,000 per -- per mortgage to manufacturing. And out of that $8,000, $5,200 of it is just associated to manual processing. And at a minimum, we believe through our AI offerings, there is a great opportunity to chip away at minimum half of that, $2,600 in savings is right for automation. And this is things like I mentioned in the script around credit analyzers and last quarter I talked about our income analyzers. This is taking all the stare and compare work that happens and when you get a credit report to see what was the date of it, what was the score. You compare the score on the credit report to the information that we have in our old rigs business around what are the underwriting requirements for the particular product that this customer has applied for. And we're able to automate a ton of the process right now that is done manually, and it's one of the highest growth sales items we've seen. And as I said in an answer to a prior question that we hit a record in Q4 of new sales of this product. And in terms of the $4 billion TAM, it's a pretty easy number to get to. If you look at efficiencies that we provide and assume conservatively, it's $2,600 in savings per loan that -- that we can provide to customers. If we monetize a part of that, say, some subset of that, and you use a round number of around $10 million loans being done per year, which is way down from what it was last year. You do the math on $10 million loans, we roughly have almost 50% market share in loan flow that's going through times 1 subset of that save, and you get to a very big number very quickly. And as our customers are seeing that benefit, we're obviously monetizing it by  providing that to them.\nOperator: The next question is from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Maybe just to dig a little bit deeper on the mortgage recurring revenue, the guide of the $122 million to $127 million, it's a bit of a wide range. Maybe if you -- Ben, if you could talk about the variables that you're seeing that sort of impact the low versus the high end of that range? And then if you can -- I think you gave guidance for the recurring revenue in fixed income for the full year. I'm not sure if I missed the recurring revenue guide for Mortgage Technology for the full year or if you have a view on that? And then if I could just waiver in the synergy on the data side in terms of coming up with real time -- more real-time mortgage production data. I know you're working on that. Maybe just an update on -- progress report on that?\nScott Hill: Well, okay, so that one question I think had three parts. Let me see if I can hit them. First of all, I don't know that $5 million wide on an over $100 million guide is that wide. It's simply a matter of customers that we've on-boarded and that we expect to continue to on board, I mean, that's the thing. Again, if you look at the history that we provided on that line, our recurring Mortgage Technology revenue in fourth quarter of '19 were $92 million, they were $95 million, $100 million, $108 million, $119 million. So we've seen that consistent growth on a sequential quarterly basis because of everything then talked about. More customers, customers that had a certain number of seats sign up or more seat. And so, we expect growth to go through the quarter and exactly whether or not that growth is going to add $1 million or $3 million, again, on an over $120 million guide, plus or minus a little bit, then it seems like that's the way to guide, because it's not $5 million wide, it's actually plus or minus $2.5 million. But we -- so we feel good about it. What I said on the data business and to be specific, the fixed income recurring revenues, based on 5.7% ASV, we fully expect the business to again go right around that 5% to 6% for the year. As you know that ASV figure now is effectively 100% of the revenue in that segment. And so, we're able to tell you that plus or minus a little bit given that ASV is 5.7% -- we think 5% to 6% growth is the right view in terms of thinking about the full year for that fixed income recurring revenue. With regards to the data piece on mortgages and how they're working with the sales team -- sorry, the Lynn's team to do that, I'll hand that to Ben. See if he's got any thought.\nBenjamin Jackson: Yes, as I mentioned in the script, there we have identified some early opportunities on the data side. As you can imagine, there is an absolute treasure trove of information and data sets that are within the Mortgage Technology business segment across all the businesses that are in there. So you have the merge business in there, you have simple file, and you have the Encompass system and the Ellie Mae business in there. Some of the areas that we're looking to leverage the data sets, the power of the datasets in there are simple things like, when you're going through a mortgage origination process, one of the most common areas where you'll see errors is very late in the process when you get to the closing. And what happens at the closing is that you have to compare the original estimates of what your closing fees are going to be at the closing table from what the original estimates were that were provided 60 plus days ago. And if those numbers are off by any amount, not even a material amount, it could be zero tolerance, 10% tolerance, you have to go back through the entire origination process again. What we found is Simplifile has all of that information. They know exactly what the closing requirements are, what the fees are in every jurisdiction around the US. We managed all of that reference data for the clients in the closing process. Pulling that type of information, all the way up front to the origination process, and then combining that with our artificial intelligence expertise and automation expertise that we have in our AI tools is able to create a significant amount of more efficiency and a higher quality loan asset that's going to be less subject to errors as you get to the closing table. And a lot of these capabilities in the artificial intelligence area and how to leverage this type of information and data is directly coming from the expertise that we have on the data side of the business.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Let me -- this is Jeff. Let me just bridge a wider point, which is, you know we've been building a technology base in the mortgage space, and it's obviously a very hot space, and we've got a really great platform and commodity. And the Ellie Mae business that we acquired was -- really turns out has been a really great business since we've owned it. But don't underestimate that a lot of the acceleration of the growth that we've seen comes from the vision that we are articulating of an end-to-end platform managed by ICE. We live in a society today where many of the platforms that we interact with, you have to ask yourself, am I actually their customer, they're providing a service to meet, but am I actually the customer. Because it is the customer, the person who is buying the data of that platform or is the customer or the person that giving up the data and exchange for free usage. And we're seeing a lot of examples right now in our society of people that believe that these free services are -- that they are actually customers. And in reality, they are not providing any revenue to them. The revenue is coming from a different source. And so, as we're out selling our vision, we're having that conversation with people in the mortgage industry, and it is resonating that very data that you asked Ben about and the way that Artificial Intelligence will interact with that data is an area that ICE has built decades of trust in the financial services industry about how we manage that data, who owns it, where it's going to go and how we're going to protect it. And I think that that bodes well for us as we continue to have a broader conversation in our society about data privacy and data rights.\nOperator: The next question is from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Good morning everybody. Jeff, a question for you around maybe some of the regulatory things, potentially might be on the comp, but really was hoping to get your perspective on everything that's going on in the retail trading side of the equation. It feels like concept of payment for order flow has come up a bunch times in the past, I don't know if this time is going to be any different, but curious to kind of get your perspective on how things might evolve and whether or not with 50% of volumes now trading off exchange, could there be an opportunity for the lit venues to grab some of that market share back?\nJeffrey Sprecher: It's a great question. One, obviously, we've been thinking about over the last week or so. I guess I'll remind you that when we bought the New York Stock Exchange, we were pretty vocal about the fact that we thought that the market structure in the US equity space was flawed and that it needed a holistic review. And in fact, we tried to come up with a grand bargain that we talked to many, many people across the industry about that would have resulted in some major change. We were unsuccessful, and the last SEC seem to spend inordinate amount of time on governance of industry consortiums basically that manage infrastructure and didn't really step back and look at the totality of the infrastructure and whether or not it operates properly. And I think as you've heard through the guidance that Scott gave, fortunately or unfortunately that infrastructure paralyzes the industry somewhat and stifles innovation in my view. And so, we're going to have a new SEC Chair and -- Chairman Gensler is confirmed and he actually takes that seat. He is a person that worked in the derivative space in part of his career, worked in the regulated commodities and derivatives space for part of his career and has a deep interest in -- and knowledge of market structure. The SEC has got a dual role to a sense that it's an enforcement agency and a consumer protection agency, as well as a market structure agency. And historically, the people that have shared the agency have been lawyers by training who are much more comfortable on the enforcement and compliance side of things. And I think there is an opportunity and we'll see it in the results, but there is an opportunity with a new Chair and a new vision inside the SEC to potentially talk about a grand bargain again which we would welcome. And by that, I mean, we would give up some unique positioning that we have if others did the same thing and try to get back to a more innovative, transparent regulated market where we could see innovation as it's unique to the United States, continue to grow our capital markets.\nOperator: The next question is from Ari Ghosh of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAri Ghosh: Hey, good morning everyone. Ben, just a quick one on Mortgage Tech. Even, you know on the origination tech revenue piece, just curious how we should think about the sensitivity to market conditions will be here, say, either like a backlog or do you have any visibility for a portion of this transaction-based revenues. Again, just curious, because I think you were embedding pretty conservative industry and refi assumptions for the year and the outlook perhaps looks a little more favorable than it did three to four months ago? Thanks.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Ari. I'll go -- I'll go through it. How we see the businesses ability to grow through various volume cycles, and I'll answer your direct question around volumes. So if you think about this business -- this business and what really excited about us, and just the results that we've seen in the few months that we've owned it now have just further confirmed the businesses ability to grow through volume environments are that: one, it's continuing to gain market share. I've shared the sales results, so you can see that. Number two, more customers equals more loan flow. And when you have more loan flow going on to that network, on average a loan that's going through our network with customers of ours on the platform, we see that that loan interacts around 7 times with various third parties on the network. So each new loan that comes on to that network, they are 7 different times that it's interacting with third-party service providers and services that we provide on that network, and for third-party service providers, we get a fee for the efficiency that we provide for somebody interacting with that loan. The third area is just -- it's a process that's right for automation, and I touched upon the opportunity there, around 10 million loans, and at least $2,600 in efficiency and some subset of that if you do the math, and it's a big number. And then the fourth area is the electronification of the close that we are in a very unique position with the MERS and Simplifile assets in the network that we have on the closing side that's extremely unique, integrating that with our origination network through Encompass by connecting that into an eClose room, and we have several big deliveries this year, one in Q2 of our hybrid eClose offering, and then followed shortly after in the second half of the year a full eClose offering. We see that's going to be an area of growth for 2022 and beyond. When it comes to volumes itself, we do have a bit of a unique insight, because we are in origination platform. We see almost 50% of loans that are originated in the US. We do see that the loans very early on in the process. So we see them on -- the original application is coming through for a refinancing or a purchase, which gives us 60 day to 90 day preview of what the market is going to look like. You also -- you look at industry analysts, you see the estimates that are out there. If you go beyond a quarter or two, anyone that follows these estimates know that they are subject to revision and significant revision. It's very hard to predict mortgage origination volumes out beyond a couple of quarters, just like it's hard to predict US equity market volumes and oil volumes going out a few quarters to a year. What I would say is, based on the data that we see in our platform, if you take the estimates like Fannie and Freddie for the next quarter to maximum two quarters. Those are as close to what we see in the data on our platform as being indicative of what we expect volumes to be. But beyond that, it's difficult to forecast. But underneath the covers with all the other growth areas that we have regardless of volume environment, we are up -- we are very optimistic that this business can grow.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Allen of Compass Point. Please go ahead.\nChris Allen: Good morning guys. I just wanted to follow-on mortgage beat. I just wanted to ask, just in terms of the share gains that you're seeing, how much is coming from existing customers versus new customers? And any update in terms of penetration of the independent mortgage banks which I think as you talked about in the past is potentially 20%, 25% share opportunity over the longer term?\nScott Hill: Sure. So we're actually seeing -- thanks, Chris, for the question. So we're seeing growth literally across every segment of customer in our platform. So yes, independent mortgage bankers, we are seeing their share of the market. It'd be very strong, in particular, on the purchase side of the market. With refinances, you do tend to see some refinance volume to go to some of the -- some of the large banks, just because that's where you have a lot of your banking relationship with -- people tend to go there, but in the purchase market, we are seeing that independent banks are continuing to grow. That said, we're growing in each segment. So we service the large banks, we service the independent mortgage banks, we service correspondent banks, wholesale banks, you name it. And what we're looking at that sales strength that I referenced earlier, we're seeing -- we're seeing that strength across the -- across the entire portfolio. And one other thing I'd just highlight on the volume front here, we tend to -- if you look at our share and our strength, a lot of it is balanced in the purchase market, albeit we do interact a lot with the refinance market as well. When we look at the trends of what happened in 2020 and going into this year, we're seeing application volumes up significantly in refi, they are up as well significantly in purchase, but not as much as refi. And on the refinance side, if you look at estimates that Fannie and Freddie have, for example, for 30-year mortgages of 2.7% to 2.9% right now for calendar year 2021, that puts up to 20 million units significantly in the money for refinancing, which is a higher number than what we said when we actually announced this deal. So we still see a tail in refinance volumes. We're seeing -- underneath the covers, one of the things on purchase, we are seeing pent up demand on the purchase side. There is just not a lot of inventory out there. So as vaccines rollout, as the economy starts rolling, as people are willing to move and actually sell, I think you have a decent amount of purchase demand pent up there as well, which given that our market shares tend to be a little bit more tilted towards purchase and refi, that's another tailwind for us.\nOperator: The next question is from Owen Lau of Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nOwen Lau: Good morning, and thank you for taking my question. So on Slide 20, you disclosed that you have a 1.4% ownership in coin base. Could you please talk about the cost basis? Why did you make that investment and is there any synergy with ICE or Bakkt? Thank you.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Yes, that's a good question. First of all, as a company, we never thought that we were a private equity firm or venture firm, and that -- that we should be stewards of our shareholders' money in that regard. We've always thought that excess capital should be returned. But we have made investments in a number of businesses that are adjacent to us, where we thought there was some strategic advantage by having a relationship with the company, either by partnering with them or by a knowledge transfer and what have you. And so, we invested in coin base in its early rounds, because we were trying to understand the blockchain and the significance of digital currencies in payments and that's -- and obviously the company has been phenomenally successful. And I'm sure the value of our stake has increased, and our investment was just almost insignificant honestly, so, in terms of a monetary number. The -- I would also say, we have, obviously, a similar kind of investment in Bakkt, which again was driven by us, trying to understand blockchain. And as you may recall, three years ago, two and three years ago, a lot of people were asking us whether blockchain was going to be used for clearing, whether it was going to disrupt the traditional financial services industry, and we wanted to be on top of that technology and have that knowledge. And so, we also invested and help stand up Bakkt, which again, I think as a company that we have a small basis -- a basis that has dramatically increased, say that way. We also made an investment in Euroclear, which is European custody solution that again where we have adjacency too. Our company is doing very, very well. And so, we do have, as your question, I think, I was trying to allude to a number of very, very interesting assets that have value, that I think over time will try to unlock for our shareholders as those partnerships and knowledge transfers come to some fruition.\nOperator: The next question is from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning. So in the fourth quarter, S&P Global announced its acquisition of IHS. Just last week, we had the LSE Refinitiv deal close. Just give me size of these transactions. Can you just talk about the kind of broad competitive environment and landscape in your fixed income and data segment? And maybe how you would expect the environment to evolve as some of these competitors gain scale or add product breadth?\nJeffrey Sprecher: Sure. Well, I'm glad to say that we recognized early the adjacency of data and information and analytics around risk management and move relatively quickly to formalize our internal offerings and also make acquisitions, similar large acquisitions for us that -- that is really now probably half of our business in serving data and analytics. And I use that number roughly, but it's somewhat how we think of the business. They are intertwined virtuous circle of risk management along with the data and information that it takes to manage our portfolio risk. And so, it's not surprising to us that others are making moves in that space. With respect to all the companies actually that you mentioned, we have some relationships with them, and in both, at times, we use some of their platforms and at times they use some of our platforms and data and indices. And so, you've seen a movement of large exchange and data information groups advancing their own businesses, but also somewhat collaborating across the industry where necessary. So we have a good relationship with the managers of all of those companies, even though in some areas we are fierce competitors, and in other areas, we cooperate for the betterment of the industry.\nOperator: The next question is from Simon Clinch of Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.\nSimon Clinch: Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if we'd jump back to the mortgage tech side again. And just to your comments about -- just under 50% market share on the origination side, I was wondering if you could talk about the -- how you see the future competitive environment developing in origination and what you think -- where you think that market share can go? Is that a natural cap to that market share for you in the normal way?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Simon. What's -- what's amazing when we -- as we've -- over the last decade looked at the mortgage space, you've got an area of the marketplace that you can't emphasize enough how analog it is. When you look at -- to your -- that market share that I had mentioned, and you say, what's second behind that. What's second behind that is a lot of homegrown systems, excel spreadsheet or stitched together systems. And that's what gave us a ton of confidence in doing this transaction that there is a long way to go in terms of market share just in the origination side. But the other piece that -- that I can't emphasize enough is that, we are in a very unique position where not only do we have this very strong origination network in helping to write a ton of benefit to our customers in automating this manual workflow, we're in a unique position where we also have these significant network in the electronification of the close, in that closing process. And where the magic we see is really going to happen in this deal is not only in the automation or the origination front, but by standing up, which we have done in eClosing room that for the first time we'll link your underwriter of your loans to the bank or independent mortgage company and the underwriter that's underwriting your loan to your attorney, your settlement agent, your title insurance provider, et cetera, all into a digital closing room to be able to codify that transaction closes electronically, register it on MERS, both in note as well as -- as well as the loan, be able to electronically vault all the documentation associated to it, and file it in the local county courthouse electronically by a Simplifile. That is an incredible capability that we're introducing to the market. We already have several key strategic pieces of it launched, because we had a partnership with Ellie Mae prior to doing the transaction. And as I mentioned earlier, we have some very key pieces of functionality that are in the pilot phase and rolling out in Q2 on our eClose solution. And then we have another big set of functionality coming out in the second half of this year, that's all going to lead to long-term 2022-2023 additional tailwinds for this business.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Yes, just to focus on how we're thinking about mortgage right now, the real opportunity for us is to take the loan origination customers that were on Ellie Mae and get them to use the other services on our network that we find that the customers that use the entire network have a multiple of revenues for us beyond those that are simply using the loan origination platform. So the market share, if you are, that we're looking at internally is the bigger TAM of end-to-end services that Ben just described. And we have seen, and I've been involved, and Ben has been involved, and Scott has been involved, actually all of the three of us here have all been involved in helping Ellie close some LOS deals, where we've been able to articulate the end-to-end vision, and that's brought the new customer to the platform for the loan origination system, but it is that full vision I think that is -- that is helping to increase the market share if you solely look at loan origination. But the bigger addressable market for us is taking those already loan origination customers and getting them to use the end-to-end network.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Sprecher at this time.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Thank you, Kate. I thank all of you for joining us this morning, and we'll look forward to speaking to you again soon. But in the meantime, I hope that you stay safe and that you and your loved ones stay healthy. And with that, we'll conclude the call and have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 9, where I'll begin with some of the highlights and key initiatives across our Global Energy business. While inflation, economic growth and geopolitics will always influence volume trends in a particular quarter or year, we are focusing on investing in the structural growth opportunities that exists across Global Energy markets. Investments that have been critical to the 7% average annual revenue growth we have generated across our energy and environmental network over the last five years. Hi, Rich. We saw this. So the first thing to start with is on the mortgage side of the business. When someone subscribes to come onto our network, they're getting our full platform and our network services as part of that. So there is a base level of subscription fee that someone's paying to be a part of that and that's really what that recurring revenue piece is. And when we analyze the deal, one of the exciting things that we saw under the covers here and that I've talked about in terms of the different TAMs that we can go after here with this business, out of that $10 billion TAM, $4 billion alone is just in the origination side and automating that whole origination process. And we had seen that Ellie Mae had increased market share, 38% to 44%, in a pretty short period of time, and we had conviction that they're going to continue to grow market share in that space. I'm pleased to say that under the covers what we've seen in terms of sales performance and I even highlighted this on the last quarterly earnings call, back in October, that the sales results have been phenomenal in terms of selling new versions of our loan origination system into new customers and then also cross sales of our products into the customer base. And to go into that even a little bit further, in Q3 and Q4, the company set all-time records in terms of bookings on the Encompass Loan Origination System. So Q3 and Q4 are the two highest quarters ever in the company's history. Q4 across the entire Ellie Mae product set was the largest bookings quarter ever in the company's history. So all of that are real tailwinds. Scott gave the guide to the Q1 recurring revenue for the business as well and why we feel really strong about the businesses ability to grow that recurring revenue base regardless of volume environments. Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. So obviously, fourth quarter blew away all industry estimates in terms of volume. So you got to set that aside. And when we did this deal, we are very clear that we saw this as a long-term growth trend and that we are convinced that on an annual basis, we can grow this business and this business will grow 8% to 10% per year on average over 10 years. And underneath the covers, as I just referenced in the answer I gave to Rich, if you look under the covers of what's happened with that business since we've acquired it, sales strength has been very strong. So I mentioned a couple of the Encompass records that we saw over the last couple of quarters. Also another in that, $4 billion of the $10 billion TAM, another $4 billion of that $10 billion TAM is around data and analytics. And we also saw record sales of our AIQ platform, so record bookings of the analyzers that are automating that origination workflow in the fourth quarter. We continue to see strength across Encompass as well as AIQ in January, and we're ahead in January than where we thought we were going to be in terms of our model. What this means is that, as we're hitting these types of sales results and sales records for the company, it obviously means there's going to be more recurring revenue into the business. It means it's going to be more customers on the business. There's going to be more loans that are on the platforms that are now on our network loans that we did not interact with before. And more loans on our network interact with the third parties on the network that we have and for the efficiencies that we provide to people, ordering services like our flood report or credit report of that network, we monetize that, charge a service fee for the efficiency that we're providing. So all of these we see as significant tailwinds into the business that gives us confidence that we can grow regardless of volume environment over a long period of time with that 8% to 10% guidance. Thanks, Ken. This is Ben. So this is an area that we have invested heavily and the business has invested heavily in. And when we're looking at and analyzing doing and the acquisition of Ellie Mae, it's one of the areas we were absolutely most excited about. And the area of this business under data and analytics is really that AIQ business, that's an acquisition that Ellie Mae has done a few years ago. And if you look at the heart of what that business is all about and investments that we've made, it's all about automating the very manual part of the origination workflow. And we've used statistics in the past of -- they are costing around $8,000 per -- per mortgage to manufacturing. And out of that $8,000, $5,200 of it is just associated to manual processing. And at a minimum, we believe through our AI offerings, there is a great opportunity to chip away at minimum half of that, $2,600 in savings is right for automation. And this is things like I mentioned in the script around credit analyzers and last quarter I talked about our income analyzers. This is taking all the stare and compare work that happens and when you get a credit report to see what was the date of it, what was the score. You compare the score on the credit report to the information that we have in our old rigs business around what are the underwriting requirements for the particular product that this customer has applied for. And we're able to automate a ton of the process right now that is done manually, and it's one of the highest growth sales items we've seen. And as I said in an answer to a prior question that we hit a record in Q4 of new sales of this product. And in terms of the $4 billion TAM, it's a pretty easy number to get to. If you look at efficiencies that we provide and assume conservatively, it's $2,600 in savings per loan that -- that we can provide to customers. If we monetize a part of that, say, some subset of that, and you use a round number of around $10 million loans being done per year, which is way down from what it was last year. You do the math on $10 million loans, we roughly have almost 50% market share in loan flow that's going through times 1 subset of that save, and you get to a very big number very quickly. And as our customers are seeing that benefit, we're obviously monetizing it by  providing that to them. Yes, as I mentioned in the script, there we have identified some early opportunities on the data side. As you can imagine, there is an absolute treasure trove of information and data sets that are within the Mortgage Technology business segment across all the businesses that are in there. So you have the merge business in there, you have simple file, and you have the Encompass system and the Ellie Mae business in there. Some of the areas that we're looking to leverage the data sets, the power of the datasets in there are simple things like, when you're going through a mortgage origination process, one of the most common areas where you'll see errors is very late in the process when you get to the closing. And what happens at the closing is that you have to compare the original estimates of what your closing fees are going to be at the closing table from what the original estimates were that were provided 60 plus days ago. And if those numbers are off by any amount, not even a material amount, it could be zero tolerance, 10% tolerance, you have to go back through the entire origination process again. What we found is Simplifile has all of that information. They know exactly what the closing requirements are, what the fees are in every jurisdiction around the US. We managed all of that reference data for the clients in the closing process. Pulling that type of information, all the way up front to the origination process, and then combining that with our artificial intelligence expertise and automation expertise that we have in our AI tools is able to create a significant amount of more efficiency and a higher quality loan asset that's going to be less subject to errors as you get to the closing table. And a lot of these capabilities in the artificial intelligence area and how to leverage this type of information and data is directly coming from the expertise that we have on the data side of the business. Thanks, Ari. I'll go -- I'll go through it. How we see the businesses ability to grow through various volume cycles, and I'll answer your direct question around volumes. So if you think about this business -- this business and what really excited about us, and just the results that we've seen in the few months that we've owned it now have just further confirmed the businesses ability to grow through volume environments are that: one, it's continuing to gain market share. I've shared the sales results, so you can see that. Number two, more customers equals more loan flow. And when you have more loan flow going on to that network, on average a loan that's going through our network with customers of ours on the platform, we see that that loan interacts around 7 times with various third parties on the network. So each new loan that comes on to that network, they are 7 different times that it's interacting with third-party service providers and services that we provide on that network, and for third-party service providers, we get a fee for the efficiency that we provide for somebody interacting with that loan. The third area is just -- it's a process that's right for automation, and I touched upon the opportunity there, around 10 million loans, and at least $2,600 in efficiency and some subset of that if you do the math, and it's a big number. And then the fourth area is the electronification of the close that we are in a very unique position with the MERS and Simplifile assets in the network that we have on the closing side that's extremely unique, integrating that with our origination network through Encompass by connecting that into an eClose room, and we have several big deliveries this year, one in Q2 of our hybrid eClose offering, and then followed shortly after in the second half of the year a full eClose offering. We see that's going to be an area of growth for 2022 and beyond. When it comes to volumes itself, we do have a bit of a unique insight, because we are in origination platform. We see almost 50% of loans that are originated in the US. We do see that the loans very early on in the process. So we see them on -- the original application is coming through for a refinancing or a purchase, which gives us 60 day to 90 day preview of what the market is going to look like. You also -- you look at industry analysts, you see the estimates that are out there. If you go beyond a quarter or two, anyone that follows these estimates know that they are subject to revision and significant revision. It's very hard to predict mortgage origination volumes out beyond a couple of quarters, just like it's hard to predict US equity market volumes and oil volumes going out a few quarters to a year. What I would say is, based on the data that we see in our platform, if you take the estimates like Fannie and Freddie for the next quarter to maximum two quarters. Those are as close to what we see in the data on our platform as being indicative of what we expect volumes to be. But beyond that, it's difficult to forecast. But underneath the covers with all the other growth areas that we have regardless of volume environment, we are up -- we are very optimistic that this business can grow. Thanks, Simon. What's -- what's amazing when we -- as we've -- over the last decade looked at the mortgage space, you've got an area of the marketplace that you can't emphasize enough how analog it is. When you look at -- to your -- that market share that I had mentioned, and you say, what's second behind that. What's second behind that is a lot of homegrown systems, excel spreadsheet or stitched together systems. And that's what gave us a ton of confidence in doing this transaction that there is a long way to go in terms of market share just in the origination side.

            "name": "Jeffrey Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Ben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 12. Over two years ago, and in collaboration with Starbucks and Microsoft, among others, we ceded a venture within ICE call Bakkt. Our vision was to leverage our collective core competencies to build a regulated ecosystem that would support the full lifecycle of a digital asset, and through efficiency gains and greater transparency, a platform that would have strong network effects within a nascent but rapidly growing asset class. Let me -- this is Jeff. Let me just bridge a wider point, which is, you know we've been building a technology base in the mortgage space, and it's obviously a very hot space, and we've got a really great platform and commodity. And the Ellie Mae business that we acquired was -- really turns out has been a really great business since we've owned it. But don't underestimate that a lot of the acceleration of the growth that we've seen comes from the vision that we are articulating of an end-to-end platform managed by ICE. We live in a society today where many of the platforms that we interact with, you have to ask yourself, am I actually their customer, they're providing a service to meet, but am I actually the customer. Because it is the customer, the person who is buying the data of that platform or is the customer or the person that giving up the data and exchange for free usage. And we're seeing a lot of examples right now in our society of people that believe that these free services are -- that they are actually customers. And in reality, they are not providing any revenue to them. The revenue is coming from a different source. And so, as we're out selling our vision, we're having that conversation with people in the mortgage industry, and it is resonating that very data that you asked Ben about and the way that Artificial Intelligence will interact with that data is an area that ICE has built decades of trust in the financial services industry about how we manage that data, who owns it, where it's going to go and how we're going to protect it. And I think that that bodes well for us as we continue to have a broader conversation in our society about data privacy and data rights. It's a great question. One, obviously, we've been thinking about over the last week or so. I guess I'll remind you that when we bought the New York Stock Exchange, we were pretty vocal about the fact that we thought that the market structure in the US equity space was flawed and that it needed a holistic review. And in fact, we tried to come up with a grand bargain that we talked to many, many people across the industry about that would have resulted in some major change. We were unsuccessful, and the last SEC seem to spend inordinate amount of time on governance of industry consortiums basically that manage infrastructure and didn't really step back and look at the totality of the infrastructure and whether or not it operates properly. And I think as you've heard through the guidance that Scott gave, fortunately or unfortunately that infrastructure paralyzes the industry somewhat and stifles innovation in my view. And so, we're going to have a new SEC Chair and -- Chairman Gensler is confirmed and he actually takes that seat. He is a person that worked in the derivative space in part of his career, worked in the regulated commodities and derivatives space for part of his career and has a deep interest in -- and knowledge of market structure. The SEC has got a dual role to a sense that it's an enforcement agency and a consumer protection agency, as well as a market structure agency. And historically, the people that have shared the agency have been lawyers by training who are much more comfortable on the enforcement and compliance side of things. And I think there is an opportunity and we'll see it in the results, but there is an opportunity with a new Chair and a new vision inside the SEC to potentially talk about a grand bargain again which we would welcome. And by that, I mean, we would give up some unique positioning that we have if others did the same thing and try to get back to a more innovative, transparent regulated market where we could see innovation as it's unique to the United States, continue to grow our capital markets. Yes, that's a good question. First of all, as a company, we never thought that we were a private equity firm or venture firm, and that -- that we should be stewards of our shareholders' money in that regard. We've always thought that excess capital should be returned. But we have made investments in a number of businesses that are adjacent to us, where we thought there was some strategic advantage by having a relationship with the company, either by partnering with them or by a knowledge transfer and what have you. And so, we invested in coin base in its early rounds, because we were trying to understand the blockchain and the significance of digital currencies in payments and that's -- and obviously the company has been phenomenally successful. And I'm sure the value of our stake has increased, and our investment was just almost insignificant honestly, so, in terms of a monetary number. The -- I would also say, we have, obviously, a similar kind of investment in Bakkt, which again was driven by us, trying to understand blockchain. And as you may recall, three years ago, two and three years ago, a lot of people were asking us whether blockchain was going to be used for clearing, whether it was going to disrupt the traditional financial services industry, and we wanted to be on top of that technology and have that knowledge. And so, we also invested and help stand up Bakkt, which again, I think as a company that we have a small basis -- a basis that has dramatically increased, say that way. We also made an investment in Euroclear, which is European custody solution that again where we have adjacency too. Our company is doing very, very well. And so, we do have, as your question, I think, I was trying to allude to a number of very, very interesting assets that have value, that I think over time will try to unlock for our shareholders as those partnerships and knowledge transfers come to some fruition. Sure. Well, I'm glad to say that we recognized early the adjacency of data and information and analytics around risk management and move relatively quickly to formalize our internal offerings and also make acquisitions, similar large acquisitions for us that -- that is really now probably half of our business in serving data and analytics. And I use that number roughly, but it's somewhat how we think of the business. They are intertwined virtuous circle of risk management along with the data and information that it takes to manage our portfolio risk. And so, it's not surprising to us that others are making moves in that space. With respect to all the companies actually that you mentioned, we have some relationships with them, and in both, at times, we use some of their platforms and at times they use some of our platforms and data and indices. And so, you've seen a movement of large exchange and data information groups advancing their own businesses, but also somewhat collaborating across the industry where necessary. So we have a good relationship with the managers of all of those companies, even though in some areas we are fierce competitors, and in other areas, we cooperate for the betterment of the industry. Yes, just to focus on how we're thinking about mortgage right now, the real opportunity for us is to take the loan origination customers that were on Ellie Mae and get them to use the other services on our network that we find that the customers that use the entire network have a multiple of revenues for us beyond those that are simply using the loan origination platform.

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Scott Hill",
            "content": "Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4, with some key highlights from 2020, and a summary of our strong fourth quarter results. Earnings per share of $4.51 were up 16% year-over-year on record revenues of over $6 billion. Free cash flow totaled a record $2.4 billion, and we returned nearly $2 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. We also use some of that cash in our strong credit profile to make the important strategic acquisition of Ellie Mae in September, an acquisition that was nearly 3% accretive to our full-year 2020 earnings per share. Our fourth quarter results were an exclamation point on a great year. Earnings per share totaled $1.13, up 19% year-over-year. Net revenues totaled approximately $1.7 billion, a 14% increase on a pro-forma basis. While we've now transitioned to new segment reporting, I'll mention that fourth quarter data services revenues totaled $595 million, which was at the high end of our guidance range and up 6% year-over-year. For the full year, despite the challenges brought on by the pandemic, our data sales teams focused on serving our customers, deliver data services revenues that grew 5% over the prior year, and one of the top of our guidance entering the year. Yes, Rich, you picked up on it exactly right. We did want to continue to give transparency in our guidance on those elements of our business that are recurring, and the leisure to predict in some of the volume based business. And you're exactly right that if you add up the total of the recurring guide, it's around mid-point, $830 million of revenue, which is just less than half of the overall business. If you look at -- we've given you that detail on a pro-forma basis historically, and if you do the math on the guide in the first quarter, those recurring revenues are growing 7% to 9%. So very strong performance on a very stable part of our business right out of the gate, obviously led by a strong performance in the mortgage business, which has picked up customers, picked up volume from existing customers, but then also the data business, which again, despite the pandemic, as I said in my remarks, sales team did a remarkable job and put us in a position where ASV was nearly 6% entering this year. So we feel very good about those recurring businesses and we intend to continue to give you each quarter our perspective on what we expect those revenues to be. You asked specifically about the recurring nature of mortgage bit, so I'll let Ben give you a little color on what's driving that great performance. Hey, Mike. It's Scott, I'll take this, and then if Jeff wants to jump in, he can. I think your question as I understood it was looking at kind of the recurring revenues in the Exchange business, specifically exchange data, what are our expectations in terms of any revenue impact from ongoing dialog with the SEC, and the answer is none. We're in conversations about changes they discuss, but right now, we haven't seen any impact. We don't anticipate any impact. Yes, I'll tell you what I think is consistent with what we've said for probably the last two or three years, which is -- that's not a line we expect to generate a lot of growth worth, not a line that we expect going to go down much, it's just kind of be stable. And again, we've given you some history on the recurring revenue. And if you look 3Q, 4Q, the guide to 1Q that they're all, kind of, right in that same number. So there is no expectation on our end that there are any changes that are likely to impact revenue this year. We've also said in the past and I think it's still true at any changes that did come or will likely come in over the course of two, three, five years, not immediately. So the net-net answer is, no real impact expected on that bucket of revenue for us this year. Well, okay, so that one question I think had three parts. Let me see if I can hit them. First of all, I don't know that $5 million wide on an over $100 million guide is that wide. It's simply a matter of customers that we've on-boarded and that we expect to continue to on board, I mean, that's the thing. Again, if you look at the history that we provided on that line, our recurring Mortgage Technology revenue in fourth quarter of '19 were $92 million, they were $95 million, $100 million, $108 million, $119 million. So we've seen that consistent growth on a sequential quarterly basis because of everything then talked about. More customers, customers that had a certain number of seats sign up or more seat. And so, we expect growth to go through the quarter and exactly whether or not that growth is going to add $1 million or $3 million, again, on an over $120 million guide, plus or minus a little bit, then it seems like that's the way to guide, because it's not $5 million wide, it's actually plus or minus $2.5 million. But we -- so we feel good about it. What I said on the data business and to be specific, the fixed income recurring revenues, based on 5.7% ASV, we fully expect the business to again go right around that 5% to 6% for the year. As you know that ASV figure now is effectively 100% of the revenue in that segment. And so, we're able to tell you that plus or minus a little bit given that ASV is 5.7% -- we think 5% to 6% growth is the right view in terms of thinking about the full year for that fixed income recurring revenue. With regards to the data piece on mortgages and how they're working with the sales team -- sorry, the Lynn's team to do that, I'll hand that to Ben. See if he's got any thought. Sure. So we're actually seeing -- thanks, Chris, for the question. So we're seeing growth literally across every segment of customer in our platform. So yes, independent mortgage bankers, we are seeing their share of the market. It'd be very strong, in particular, on the purchase side of the market. With refinances, you do tend to see some refinance volume to go to some of the -- some of the large banks, just because that's where you have a lot of your banking relationship with -- people tend to go there, but in the purchase market, we are seeing that independent banks are continuing to grow. That said, we're growing in each segment. So we service the large banks, we service the independent mortgage banks, we service correspondent banks, wholesale banks, you name it. And what we're looking at that sales strength that I referenced earlier, we're seeing -- we're seeing that strength across the -- across the entire portfolio. And one other thing I'd just highlight on the volume front here, we tend to -- if you look at our share and our strength, a lot of it is balanced in the purchase market, albeit we do interact a lot with the refinance market as well. When we look at the trends of what happened in 2020 and going into this year, we're seeing application volumes up significantly in refi, they are up as well significantly in purchase, but not as much as refi. And on the refinance side, if you look at estimates that Fannie and Freddie have, for example, for 30-year mortgages of 2.7% to 2.9% right now for calendar year 2021, that puts up to 20 million units significantly in the money for refinancing, which is a higher number than what we said when we actually announced this deal. So we still see a tail in refinance volumes. We're seeing -- underneath the covers, one of the things on purchase, we are seeing pent up demand on the purchase side. There is just not a lot of inventory out there. So as vaccines rollout, as the economy starts rolling, as people are willing to move and actually sell, I think you have a decent amount of purchase demand pent up there as well, which given that our market shares tend to be a little bit more tilted towards purchase and refi, that's another tailwind for us."

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Intercontinental Exchange Third Quarter Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.  Mr. Gardiner, you may begin your conference.\nWarren Gardiner: Thank you. Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2020 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2019 Form 10-K, third quarter Form10-Q and other filings with the SEC.\nScott Hill: Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some year-to-date and third quarter highlights. Through the first nine months of 2020, we've generated record revenues, record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share, all of which have grown double-digit over a record year in 2019. This from business performance, allowed us to return $1.7 million of capital to our shareholders, 10% more than in the prior year and importantly, our solid financial position enabled us to invest $11 million to extend our mortgage network through the acquisition of Ellie Mae. For the third quarter, we generated earnings per share of $1.03 on net revenues of $1.4 billion. Data services revenue grew to a record $589 million an increase of 6% versus the prior year. Trading and Clearing revenues revenue totaled $711 million. Of note, our total mortgage revenue in the third quarter grew 62% on a pro forma basis versus third quarter a year ago, while ICE's total net revenues pro forma for Ellie Mae grew 7% year-over-year. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $611 million including $29 million related to Ellie Mae. Total expenses would have been roughly $7 million higher if not for some credits we don\u2019t expect to repeat in subsequent quarters. As we move into the fourth quarter, we expect marketing expenses to accelerate related to a robust IPO pipeline and the launch of back mobile consumer finance app. Combined with a full quarter of Ellie, which we expect will contribute around $105 million to $110 million we expect fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses in the range of $695 million to $705 million.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Scott and good morning to everyone on the call. As I begin, I'd like to welcome the Ellie Mae team to their first ICE earnings call. While it's been less than two months since we closed on the acquisition in early September, I've been impressed by the collaboration between our teams during this short time and I am confident that the integration of Ellie Mae is off to a very strong start. I believe this is a testament to the talent of our respected employee population and our share of entrepreneurial cultures. Similar to our exchanges in fixed income businesses, Ellie Mae integrated into Ice Mortgage Technology as a network, a network that thrives by offering a value proposition that aligns growth with the efficiency gains that we bring to our customers. As we've seen across our network in futures, equity and fixed income, these efficiency gains are best achieved through harnessing unstructured data to create admission critical information, seamlessly linking participants to that information and ensuring that the network technology underpinnings are of the highest quality and security. It is the execution of this value proposition that often propels and analog to digital conversion of an industry and it's a blue print that we've applied across all of our businesses for over two decades. Turning now to Slide 7, open interest in our global energy business is currently up 9% year-over-year and with average daily volume in our flagship Brent crude oil contracts up 4% through September, energy revenues in total are up 15%. This growth further contributed to our average annual revenue growth of over 7% since 2015, growth is a direct result of staying close to our customers, understand their evolving essential needs, and expanding the breath of the content that we offer across our energy network. In our growth of natural gas markets, revenues were up 27% through the first nine months of 2020 led by continued growth of LNG and in particular, our European TTF natural gas benchmark, which continues to emerge as the Brent of natural gas. In addition, our environmental markets continue to grow with revenues up 12% year-to-date and up 7% in the third quarter. The globalization of natural gas and the growing adoption of environmental markets are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. With our Brent crude oil contract serving as the cornerstone of our energy network, we've expanded the range of content that we offer to our customers and today as a result of organic and inorganic investments, trading on our network is not tied to any one product or any one region.\nOperator:  And our first question comes from the line of Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.\nRich Repetto: Good morning, Jeff and good morning, Scott. I guess given your acquisition to Ellie Mae, you got much more diverse business as you\u2019ve grown fixed income. And I guess on a some of the parts basis, the stock looks inexpensive to us anyway, so my questions are, why haven't you chosen to break it out? And I guess Scott did sort of address, you're still looking at how to report the segment results. But I guess more importantly, are you concerned over the valuation versus some of the parts? And how patient will you be over time? I know, you just acquired Ellie Mae, but how are you thinking about the some of the parts given your diversity here now?\nJeff Sprecher: Thanks for the question, Rich. So the first thing we're thinking as Scott mentioned, and you alluded to, we're going to do a better job now of presentation so that you and our investors have visibility into how we're thinking about and running our business. Basically, as I think, you know since you've covered us for many years, we run network businesses, and we run businesses and look for opportunities where the next customer or the next product on that network becomes additive to everyone on the network and continues to compound revenue and earnings growth across that network as a result. And so we're feeling really good right now, if you look at our commodity business, futures business, open interest is up 9% year-over-year, when the markets are in contango, that's normally a signal or a precursor to volume and revenue growth in the future. So we're very, very happy with the way that business is performing. If you look at our fixed income and data business, you see that ASP, which is the future indicator of business is accelerating and compounding and as we\u2019ve indicated you, if you look at our new mortgage network, which we're still combining with our other assets, it's double-digit both in subscriptions and in transactions, revenue growth and earnings growth for us in those businesses. So all of the segments that we're going to be showing you beginning in the fourth quarter are well positioned for 2021. And the reason that, that I like to end my prepared remarks on this graph that shows the long-term earnings growth of the company is that that's how we're running it and as a result of that mentality, this management team has a mentality that our job is to deliver EPS growth where we normally found that the stock will catch up to that growth. And we appreciate that many of the competitors and futures are interest rate and financial oriented competitors and they're struggling due to the interest rate environment. Many people in the data space don't have the global footprint that we have to find growth around the world and many people that are in the mortgage space don't have the market share gains that we've been able to gain, including just in the two months, since we've acquired Ellie that has continued to accelerate that business. So we're all those networks are very well positioned relative their peer group. And I think that will become apparent over time as this management team delivers bottom line results.\nScott Hill: And just interesting that price eventually catch up its value as demonstrated every share we've ever bought back in our repurchase program, a year later has been worth 20% more and two years later has been worth 40% to 50% more. And so it does catch up. I do think that the new segments will help. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we intend in early December to give you all some history with regards to how those segments will look back from 2018 and 2019, and year-to-date. So that you'll have that information early December. And as Jeff said, we'll present the company that way in the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm of UBS. Your line is open.\nAlex Kramm: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just I guess quick one on the mortgage side. First of all, I think Ellie came in better than your initial expectations. I know it's a small number. It was only a month but also 4Q looks pretty robust. So just curious about the near-term outlook. What are you seeing but related to that? I think the Mortgage Bankers Association recently revised their forecasts for activity for next year. So just curious if you're starting to get more comfortable or bullish on the outlook for next year that you've laid out? I know it's early days, but just curious about your latest thoughts?\nBen Jackson: Hey Alex, it's Ben. I'll take that. So a couple of things I'll share with you. It's only been a couple of months since we've closed on the business. But a couple of interesting things to share with the group are number one, I'll share just on the integration front, we've made a ton of progress on pulling together our mortgage assets. So the Simplifile business, the merge business, and Ellie Mae we've been able to pull those businesses together to operate as one very, very quickly. And what enabled us to do that as we knew the Ellie Mae business very well, prior to doing this transaction, because we had a long-term partnership with them with Simplifile. So we had a good view on what we were going to do, we got to a room quickly in September, we were able to make the decisions that needed to be made to get the business organized currently, have made all those decisions announce them to all the boys and now we're executing against the single vision and single strategy. Two other evidence points I'll give you is so well publicized, that volumes are strong. Rates are low, Millennials are buying, you're seeing people purchasing new homes to get more space to get a pool transitioning out of cities into suburbs, we're seeing all that kind of mix. One of the interesting things that not many people appreciate around Ellie Mae is we also have a bit of a forward view on what's happening in that space, because we're in the origination space. And we see all the way upfront in the original application process when somebody is applying for a refinance, or for the purchase of a new home, we see that 60-plus days earlier than the rest of the market. So we see those trends, I could say from what we see on the platform, so that that volumetric aspect of the business continues to be strong. It just firms our view that we had going into this transaction, what the opportunity is with this business. The third thing I'd point to and the most important thing, and Jeff just touched on it and an answer that he just had. I think the most important thing to look at is our subscription sales results. So if you we modeled a view as to where sales of new Encompass seats would be, sales of their artificial intelligence engine called AIQ, that's going after the analytics TAM that we have identified in this space, we had a view of where subscription sales would end the year. And I can say that in the last couple of weeks, the business has already hit, the subscription sales numbers where we thought they would end the year. The reason that that's important is that as we're hitting those sales results, it helps to firm our view on what we assumed market share growth would be. So they're continuing to gain market share. They're continuing to gain more customers, more users, there's more recurring revenue coming onto the platform. It's a stronger network and all of this pulls through additional volume. So net-net is everything that we've seen in the two months of owning the business has really firmed our original views.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Carrier of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nMike Carrier: Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. At least one more on Ellie Mae, given that close and doing more work in the area, can you just provide maybe an update on when you think about the growth opportunities. And more importantly, apply the different components of the revenue growth, meaning you have obviously the volume component, but also the adoption and given the ladder, you kind of get more credit, in terms of valuation over time, it's still a little bit more important. And then any other factors or opportunities that you're seeing, as you do more work in that area of the market?\nBen Jackson: Hi, Mike, it\u2019s Ben. I'll take this one as well. Thank you for your question. There's a whole bunch of different opportunities for growth in this business, which is what gave us conviction that this business can grow really through any volume environment that we see. And we touched, when we announced the deal on our ability to capture that $1 billion TAM in the closing and post closed space. So that's where we're tying together and creating any closing room for the underwriter to digitally connect to the settlement agents on the network that we have across mortgage. So I won't go into a lot more detail on that one. But I figured because we went into a lot last time, I go into a couple of others that we\u2019re capturing that I think are under appreciated. So first we\u2019ve identified that there's a $4 billion TAM in front of us in just origination and processing. And we're obviously very well positioned there, the businesses is touching almost 50% of U.S. mortgages that are coming through the process, refi and purchases. And as I just mentioned, the sales results that we've just seen has just firmed our view on the ability to continue to gain market share in that space. The second thing that that is in that origination and processing TAM is really about our network. And I don't know that people really appreciate that the fact that the business, our business here has the largest mortgage network in the U.S. So we interconnect 100s and 100s of service providers to lenders. And this network is very well established, all that connectivity exists. And there's significant benefits that the lenders themselves can receive from utilizing and buying services from those third-party providers over our network, yet, it's underutilized. So the types of benefits that lenders get from ordering services off of our network is that it's a very efficient process. If you're using the Encompass system, and you order third-party services, that ordering process is automated, because we know in the workflow when you're going to order a credit report, when you're going to order a flood report, all of that is automated. And more importantly, all of the content that comes from that third-party is digitally sent to you, so that you can consume it, you can easily move it around, you can analyze it, you can actually do things with it. The other way of ordering the services outside of the network is you'd have to manually go out and select vendors, you have to manually procure the information, you're going to get back scanned documents, PDFs, with data that you can't really do anything with, you have to have extra steps of manually rekeying information. So today, vendors are really starting to see the benefits of ordering services off of our network. And for the benefit that we're providing the lenders as well as the benefit that we're providing all these third-party data providers, we receive a revenue share for that. And we're seeing this part, this opportunity in front of us that we're starting to capture it and that part is accelerating substantially. The other piece that I'll touch on is the data and analytics side. And we've had a few questions since we announced this deal on this. And one I want to focus on is really analytics, and what we're executing against today here against another what we've identified as a $4 billion TAM. So we've identified that an average origination fee costs around $8,000. Of that time studies that we've done estimate that at least $5200 of that $8,000 is just manual processing and technology costs are well less than $500. In the year 2020, you'd think that that would almost be the reverse that manual processing would be a lot less and technology somewhat more. Our time studies have showed that at least half so call it $2,600 of that manual processing could and should be automated with simple tools to be able to analyze and take away a lot of the stare and compare work that happens. Well, this isn't just a dream, we're actually executing on this. This is a TAM that we're accomplishing and capturing what we talked about that AIQ business called Capsilon that Ellie Mae acquired in the last couple of years, this business goes through for customers today and captures documents, it recognizes the data on those documents extracted. And most importantly, we apply analyzers to that data, analyzers that today for our lenders can go through and automate the process, when you're looking at a credit report to make sure that the social security numbers match, the date of birth matches. The date of the credit report is within the window that the lender was expecting that credit report to be to approve the loan, the score that the individual had on that credit report matches the qualification criteria for the products that that consumer is applying for. All of this is happening today. And we're capturing, we're capturing this opportunity. And it's a significant growth opportunity in that data and analytics space. And we see it already coming through in terms of AIQ sales that that have happened this year on the platform and just in the last two months of owning the business, we're seeing these analyzers getting picked up from our existing customer base. So those are two new areas that I'd say to focus on going forward as other areas of growth for this business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ken Worthington of JPMorgan, your line is open.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning, and thanks for taking my question. It looks like we're seeing further pressure to migrate away from LIBOR in the U.S. Maybe first, can you remind us if there's any impact on this transition away from LIBOR in terms of data revenue, benchmark service revenue? I don't think there's much. But really, can you talk about the transition to SONIA, in terms of trading in Europe? And if there's any opportunities in this transition to either grow trading or grow data? Or should we really expect this just to be a swap from your LIBOR? Thanks.\nJeff Sprecher: Yes, it's a good question. We're right, we're in the middle of a transition. So there's a bit of fog, if you will, as to the timing of this transition obviously, regulators are pushing. But there are a lot of underlying business issues that have to get dealt with in the transition. So it's hard to know, a final date other than the trend is there. The sale of LIBOR as an index for us is a de minimis revenue. And there is a question as to how long LIBOR may survive after the industry does move to SONIA in order to pick up legacy business that that just couldn't be transitioned over. So, LIBOR make this for some time. And it's hard to know what that time is, because it's so pervasive around the world. And there are many, there are other LIBORs by the way, where LIBOR being dollar LIBOR but there are a lot of other LIBORs made, which were the calculation agent all which have the same issues. The transition is actually trading SONIA has accelerated our market share is very strong, we're probably north of 70% market share of all the trading in SONIA and so the market is getting comfortable with simultaneously trading SONIA based futures and LIBOR based futures. And, so we feel very, very comfortable and confident with where we\u2019ve positioned our trading activities to be able to provide a bridge and if they two survive side by side for some time, we'll be a net beneficiary of that as well.\nKen Worthington: But ultimately, it's a straight swap from one to the other. There's not anything of any way to really grow this -- grow from this transition?\nJeff Sprecher: Well, the one area that is really under discussion is the small and mid-sized regional banks and a whole range of products that that are not necessarily covered by is the swaps or hedged with swaps. And so what you're seeing is that having worked with the industry to come up with a common rule set on how the transition can go and you see that sort of institutional market coming up with game plans, but in the small and widely dispersed market, they're not in the swaps business and they've got, there are many people that have 30 year agreements that that have the word LIBOR in it. And so, we have been developing an alternative to LIBOR called the Bank Yield Index, which we published, we've been publishing it weekly, and people have been doing, academics have been doing white papers on it, to see how it tracks a credit based on environment. And we've now accelerated the publishing of that daily to create more data points, by the way for analysis. And it's very possible that there could be a transition away from LIBOR or for the credit space, part of the industry that is not SONIA and if so we have a very, very good benchmark that we're working on, that'll be up to regulators, and in a broad industry adoption if that happens. But there certainly is a lot of work going on underneath to try to at least have a viable alternative, should that needs or need arise.\nScott Hill: And Ken you\u2019ve seen historically, as you transition from one contract definition to a similar but different one, the impact tends to be as you near that transition point, you see a decline in the trading of the old and everyone's not quite moved into the new. And the good news for us is interest rates only make up about 4% of our revenue. So it's a relatively small impact regardless.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeremy Campbell of Barclays, your line is open.\nJeremy Campbell: Hey, thanks. Maybe just a follow-up to Mike's question little earlier around the mortgage TAM and the growth. Ben, you gave some really good color around the opportunity to capture TAM from your end-to-end suite of solutions now that Ellie's in the fold. Just wondering, as you guys look at your solutions right now, are there any additional whitespaces, you'd ideally like to fill in mortgage land either to build organically or bolt-on inorganically, that might make the holistic solution a little more compelling to the originator with whom you don't currently have a partnership or to augment the data and analytics product for LinkedIn to sell. There just seems to be some additional properties out there that could be available, but not sure if any of that fits within your vision?\nBen Jackson: Thanks, Jeremy. And what I can say there is that we feel good about the position that we're at, with the assets that we have, I mean we literally our network touches every single part and aspect alone all the way from you as a consumer are thinking about it, you're going out and doing your research and touching the point of sale systems to engagement between that individual customer and the lender that they've chosen to do that loan with, the digitization of all the documents, and helping to automate that origination process, now interconnecting the originator to the settlement agent, and electronifying the close. So we have all the right pieces. As I mentioned, we focused very, very early on just making sure that we got the integration of these businesses mailed and executing on that. And we did very, very quickly to get the team all operating as one. And the other thing I'd point out is that a lot of the work we're talking about of pulling the networks together, of creating a digital the closing room, that didn't just start now. It started in the partnership that we forged with Ellie Mae back when we bought, Simplifile and Simplifile also had relationships with them that predated that. So a lot of this work is already underway. All that said, as I had mentioned in an answer earlier, I think it's underappreciated a little bit about how strong that network is that we have, having the largest network in the U.S., mortgage origination space. So with that position, we also see what our well the third-party vendors doing, what are the quality of the services that they provide. And we're in a unique position that if there is bolt-on opportunities that we think we can accelerate growth for entities by having them more directly part of our business as a bolt-on opportunity for us we would evaluate those.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Hey, good morning. My question is on the data business, it came in above your guidance. You talked about some of the trends in your prepared remarks, Scott, but I was hoping you could kind of expand upon where the strength is coming from and you've historically talked about it on longer dated time periods in terms of the outlook. So maybe if you could give us a look into next year, how that business is trending?\nScott Hill: Sure, thanks for the question, Dan. Yes. So look, the beat in the quarter was a couple of things clearly, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the SIP revenues related to the significant retail activity in the cash equities markets contributed to that. But the one that I've just been really happy with this year has been the pricing and analytics business, that's in a world where our sales team has been limited just like everyone else, in terms of travel ability to meet face to face, they're still crushing it, they've held productivity level versus the prior-year, they're on track to achieve I think it's like 98% or 99% of their signings objective. And that is what you'll remember I said will grow 5% to 6%, coming into the year, which is in February, before I even knew what COVID was is going to grow 5% this year, and the growth has accelerated each quarter. And it's going to grow again in the fourth quarter, and likely will be around 6% growth in the fourth quarter. So that business is doing phenomenally well. And it's a lot of factors, if people continue to consume more of our prices, as consolidation of vendors happens, we can be a one stop shop for people in their day to need, whether it's our data or feeds or network or all of that, we can sell. Our index business, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're now up to $270 billion worth of assets that track our largely fixed income indices. So it's that pricing and analytics business that I'm so happy within. And then you ask about 2021. And while I won't give you dollar guide, I will point you to an ASV that was 4%, two quarters ago and is above 5% now and will trend higher in the fourth quarter. And so to me, that's I mean again, as you know, today that's 90% of our future revenue as we roll into the new segment or view that ASV will tactically be 100% of the forward revenue. And so if you've got an ASV number today, that's sitting between 5% and 6%. That says you're set up very well to deliver that type of revenue growth next year. So we feel very good about the execution of that business, very good about how the sales team has performed. I also mentioned coming into the year the fact that we were hiring into the growth opportunities we saw and we've done that hiring. But in a world where people aren't in the office, getting those that part of the team up to speed has been more of a challenge. The good news, though is that means we've had a good year this year without really a lot of productivity from the new folks. And as we move into next year, they'll join us at the higher productivity levels, and I think can give us an added boost. So that business right now is hitting on all cylinders. And we feel very good about not just the fourth quarter but about 2021.\nDan Fannon: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ari Ghosh of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nAri Ghosh: Hey, good morning, everyone. Ben, I guess just another one on the mortgage tech business (inaudible) color thus far. So the deal clearly makes a lot of sense as to growth profile, and structural tailwinds already seen really nice contributions from it from day one. But some of the larger competitors in the space have also been talking about the strength of the digital capabilities and the network effects of that basically as well. So we're just hoping you could talk a little bit about specific areas where you\u2019re the most differentiated versus some of the larger players, is it more on structured data side? Your digitization effort from the book flow or your network effects, which is something else such just looking to see areas you most differentiate?\nBen Jackson: Sure, thank you for that. I'd say the major areas where we're different is I mean if you just look at industry assessments of market shares, and those market shares reflect the strength of the network that you have, the businesses that we have, have by far the largest network that stretches all the way from the inception of the origination, all the way through to closing. And I can't stress that enough but you need to think about that entire ecosystem from the inception of your thinking about loan, all the way through to documents get filed at a county courthouse to consummate a transaction between a buyer and the seller. So it's the strength of that network is first and foremost, one of the major differentiators that we have underneath that network, so not only on the origination side do we have by far a very big market lead in terms of the loans that we touch in the U.S. trending, getting up to a close to 50%, but also in the closing and post closed space with assets like Simplifile and MERS. Simplifile we've used the phrase that they went out and paved the road. So they went out and literally did the hard work of digitizing and digitally connecting thousands and thousands of counties around the U.S. to thousands and thousands of Attorneys that are in the middle of flash settlement agents that are in the middle of closing real estate transactions. The reason that Ellie Mae was such a strong network came and did a partnership with Simplifile, a few years ago is they acknowledged and realized that the piece of the network that Ellie Mae did not have, and the only entity that really had a digital highway, a digital network, to electronically close transactions was Simplifile. So that's a lot of the real differentiator, the other piece, I'd say is underneath the network, that's under appreciated the data sets that we have that are very unique within that business. So one of the things that Simplifile has by digitizing that network of all these settlement agents and all these counties, it is the only real repository in the U.S. that knows exactly what the settlement fees are, what the settlement requires, what the settlement requirements are for every real estate, just about every real estate transaction that happened in the U.S., with that type of information, you can use that information, pull it forward into the origination process and reduce a substantial amount of errors in the processing of loans by sharing that information very early on digitally sharing it. And then also including it with the analyzers that I was speaking about earlier, to be able to compare, what are the requirements that this county has on closing a particular transaction, versus what's getting pulled together and consummated in the origination package of that loan. So those are two of the main areas I would highlight as just substantial head starts in differentiators that we have that are very difficult for others to replicate.\nJeff Sprecher: This is Jeff and one of the things that we really liked about business, when we started to think about putting together our network, our existing network, and the Ellie Mae network was that we've opened that network and so many of these companies that you may view as competitors use parts of our network in order to offer their services because our network is so comprehensive. And because it's open, and you can tick-off, you can join the network at the very beginning or all along the chain that we to a certain degree benefit from the entire growth of the industry, as partners, co-op petition, if you will, with many others in the industry. So that model is very compelling and that our goal is really, as I\u2019ve said on the final slide that we land on is to really just grow our earnings per share not necessarily to completely crush every competitor.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning folks. Thanks for taking my questions. So just one quick cleanup on the tax rate outlook for 4Q, I don't know if I missed that one. But the bigger question is on another one on the mortgage business of course. Just I guess first of all, Scott if you can just reiterate the 8% to 10% growth on the Ellie Mae business, that you've stated in the past for 2021 even with the refi headwinds. And then I guess, more importantly and thinking about the organic growth of that business from obviously the large TAMs in the processing side, but also the organic growth from existing customers using the network? And how should we sort of think about those two different elements contributing, I do think using that organic growth data, or as you talk about this segment, and you carve it out into next year, that that would definitely be something that would be helpful for devaluation. So we could isolate that. And then the ability to scale that on that cost base that you've outlined for 4Q. So you think of 2021. What not to give expense guidance specifically right now on that but how should we think about scaling the growth of the mortgage business on that existing cost base?\nScott Hill: Right, and so I think that was three questions. So the tax rate will be in the 22% to 24% guide. So that's been consistent for the year other than the third quarter as we had to revert the U.K. back to 19%. So we would expect the fourth quarter will go back to kind of where we started the year. Obviously, as we roll Ellie and that's a U.S. based business, that'll put upward pressure on the tax rate, and be subject to whatever happens in the Election. But even that, I think you're modeling, I don't see a reason right now to move away from the 22% to 24%. I'm going to do the expense first, I think one of the things we like about this mortgage business is similar to our other businesses, it is scalable in the sense of the incremental dollars generate good incremental margins that notwithstanding, we\u2019re in a place where we\u2019re making a number of investments. As Ben alluded to in his answers with regards to be building on an closing room as one really good example. And so if you're looking at the fourth quarter, I think you need to take a couple of things into account, if you want to use that as run rate. Number one, for purchase accounting, we have to rebuild the CapEx and cap labor. And so with that run rate, you should probably another 20 on top of that. And then I would throw the 20 to 25 of investments, we're going to be making to not only grow the business next year, but more importantly, two months ago on the deal call, we said we thought it was a business that could grow 8% to 10% per decade. And so we'll make some investments again, that notwithstanding you do that math, and you'll see that it will still be very accretive to the bottom line, I think in the fourth quarter alone, it's going to be 7% accretive. So that's kind of on the expense side. I don't know that today is the day we'd say a whole lot more in terms of our guide on the revenue line. I still feel good about the 8% to 10%, we do for all the reasons Ben alluded to, as we move forward. We mentioned going in that we expected the refi to go back someone in an earlier questions said that the industry assessments were improving, but they're really just improving closer to where we already were, that those estimates tend to be a little bit pessimistic. So, again, we're only two months away from closing the deal. And having the call with you all, Ben has given a lot of color on why we love this business and why we believe it absolutely was the right investment. And so as I sit here today, two months later, I'm absolutely 100% still confident that it can grow the way we've talked about.\nOperator:  Your next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nAlex Blostein: Great, thanks. Good morning, everybody. Maybe shifting gears a little bit. I was hoping we can touch on your guys's credit trading business. I believe towards the end of the year, you guys talked about maybe some sort of a full integration between ETF Hub, and some of the training venues you've acquired? So maybe talk a little bit about what's the kind of overall revenue contribution from those businesses today? How do you think about that evolving over the next 12 months or so because I think you guys made some investments there over the last 12 months?\nBen Jackson: Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. And as Scott had mentioned in the question earlier around the re-segmentation of the business that will comment in the first half of December, that's when we're going to start giving more color on the revenue aspect of this. One part of your question, on the other side of it, just to give you some flavor of continued strides that we're making on the institutional space, the strategy really has three legs to it. So first, is the automation of extremely complicated manual workflows in a space that's growing like crazy, which we've talked about a lot, which is that primary trading area of ETFs creation redemption, that's our ETF Hub project. The second leg of the strategy I talked about on our last earnings call was the launch of ICE Select and what ICE Select is, it's an aggregation engine that we've created to pull together all of our protocols. So the click to trade protocols, our auction protocols, and our RFQ protocols all into one and more importantly, it also added all of our institutional analytics and pricing content that on the buy side, all the sell side customers utilize today for understanding what the fair evaluation of the instruments are, that they're trading. And Scott had mentioned that as part of this realignment, we're really pulling together our execution venues in fixed income, very closely aligned to our fixed income data business under this. The last piece is we also, I also mentioned on the last earnings call that we've now connected ICE Select to ETF Hub and we've also connected ICE Select to third-party OMS systems, such as (inaudible). The progress that we've made since that last earnings call has been significant. So we've added another AP in Citigroup onto our ETF Hub network. We've added four more market makers, significant market makers, we now have a total of seven market makers in there that we just announced in the last couple of days. We now have six issuers that are part of our advisory committee on ETF Hub, so that the number of issuers are expanding that are helping to give us their requirements that we would need to cover to be able to add them onto the ETF Hub in addition to BlackRock. Hence we've had market makers not only testing, but now they're executing, going into the secondary market to procure bonds via ICE Select. In the last couple of weeks, we've had some market makers going and using our secondary platforms and ICE Select and go out and procure bonds, procure the baskets, then they negotiate in our primary trading menu being ETF Hub to swap that basket of bonds for share of an ETF. And the last bit of progress that we've made is that we have had multiple portfolio auctions executed on our platform by two of the largest issuers, two of the largest asset managers in the space in just past couple of weeks. So a lot of the last you've heard me talk on a number of these earnings calls, a lot of it's been putting all the infrastructure in place, laying a lot of all the rails and groundwork that needed to be done to pull this together is together and we're starting to see signs that some green shoots are starting to develop here.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Sprecher, I turn the call back over to you.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Andrea, for moderating and thank all of you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. And in the meantime, I guess I hope that you and your loved one stay safe and stay healthy. And with that, I hope to have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ben Jackson",
            "content": "Hey Alex, it's Ben. I'll take that. So a couple of things I'll share with you. It's only been a couple of months since we've closed on the business. But a couple of interesting things to share with the group are number one, I'll share just on the integration front, we've made a ton of progress on pulling together our mortgage assets. So the Simplifile business, the merge business, and Ellie Mae we've been able to pull those businesses together to operate as one very, very quickly. And what enabled us to do that as we knew the Ellie Mae business very well, prior to doing this transaction, because we had a long-term partnership with them with Simplifile. So we had a good view on what we were going to do, we got to a room quickly in September, we were able to make the decisions that needed to be made to get the business organized currently, have made all those decisions announce them to all the boys and now we're executing against the single vision and single strategy. Two other evidence points I'll give you is so well publicized, that volumes are strong. Rates are low, Millennials are buying, you're seeing people purchasing new homes to get more space to get a pool transitioning out of cities into suburbs, we're seeing all that kind of mix. One of the interesting things that not many people appreciate around Ellie Mae is we also have a bit of a forward view on what's happening in that space, because we're in the origination space. And we see all the way upfront in the original application process when somebody is applying for a refinance, or for the purchase of a new home, we see that 60-plus days earlier than the rest of the market. So we see those trends, I could say from what we see on the platform, so that that volumetric aspect of the business continues to be strong. It just firms our view that we had going into this transaction, what the opportunity is with this business. The third thing I'd point to and the most important thing, and Jeff just touched on it and an answer that he just had. I think the most important thing to look at is our subscription sales results. So if you we modeled a view as to where sales of new Encompass seats would be, sales of their artificial intelligence engine called AIQ, that's going after the analytics TAM that we have identified in this space, we had a view of where subscription sales would end the year. And I can say that in the last couple of weeks, the business has already hit, the subscription sales numbers where we thought they would end the year. The reason that that's important is that as we're hitting those sales results, it helps to firm our view on what we assumed market share growth would be. So they're continuing to gain market share. They're continuing to gain more customers, more users, there's more recurring revenue coming onto the platform. It's a stronger network and all of this pulls through additional volume. So net-net is everything that we've seen in the two months of owning the business has really firmed our original views. Hi, Mike, it's Ben. I'll take this one as well. Thank you for your question. There's a whole bunch of different opportunities for growth in this business, which is what gave us conviction that this business can grow really through any volume environment that we see. And we touched, when we announced the deal on our ability to capture that $1 billion TAM in the closing and post closed space. So that's where we're tying together and creating any closing room for the underwriter to digitally connect to the settlement agents on the network that we have across mortgage. So I won't go into a lot more detail on that one. But I figured because we went into a lot last time, I go into a couple of others that we're capturing that I think are under appreciated. So first we've identified that there's a $4 billion TAM in front of us in just origination and processing. And we're obviously very well positioned there, the businesses is touching almost 50% of U.S. mortgages that are coming through the process, refi and purchases. And as I just mentioned, the sales results that we've just seen has just firmed our view on the ability to continue to gain market share in that space. The second thing that that is in that origination and processing TAM is really about our network. And I don't know that people really appreciate that the fact that the business, our business here has the largest mortgage network in the U.S. So we interconnect 100s and 100s of service providers to lenders. And this network is very well established, all that connectivity exists. And there's significant benefits that the lenders themselves can receive from utilizing and buying services from those third-party providers over our network, yet, it's underutilized. So the types of benefits that lenders get from ordering services off of our network is that it's a very efficient process. If you're using the Encompass system, and you order third-party services, that ordering process is automated, because we know in the workflow when you're going to order a credit report, when you're going to order a flood report, all of that is automated. And more importantly, all of the content that comes from that third-party is digitally sent to you, so that you can consume it, you can easily move it around, you can analyze it, you can actually do things with it. The other way of ordering the services outside of the network is you'd have to manually go out and select vendors, you have to manually procure the information, you're going to get back scanned documents, PDFs, with data that you can't really do anything with, you have to have extra steps of manually rekeying information. So today, vendors are really starting to see the benefits of ordering services off of our network. And for the benefit that we're providing the lenders as well as the benefit that we're providing all these third-party data providers, we receive a revenue share for that. And we're seeing this part, this opportunity in front of us that we're starting to capture it and that part is accelerating substantially. The other piece that I'll touch on is the data and analytics side. And we've had a few questions since we announced this deal on this. And one I want to focus on is really analytics, and what we're executing against today here against another what we've identified as a $4 billion TAM. So we've identified that an average origination fee costs around $8,000. Of that time studies that we've done estimate that at least $5200 of that $8,000 is just manual processing and technology costs are well less than $500. In the year 2020, you'd think that that would almost be the reverse that manual processing would be a lot less and technology somewhat more. Our time studies have showed that at least half so call it $2,600 of that manual processing could and should be automated with simple tools to be able to analyze and take away a lot of the stare and compare work that happens. Well, this isn't just a dream, we're actually executing on this. This is a TAM that we're accomplishing and capturing what we talked about that AIQ business called Capsilon that Ellie Mae acquired in the last couple of years, this business goes through for customers today and captures documents, it recognizes the data on those documents extracted. And most importantly, we apply analyzers to that data, analyzers that today for our lenders can go through and automate the process, when you're looking at a credit report to make sure that the social security numbers match, the date of birth matches. The date of the credit report is within the window that the lender was expecting that credit report to be to approve the loan, the score that the individual had on that credit report matches the qualification criteria for the products that that consumer is applying for. All of this is happening today. And we're capturing, we're capturing this opportunity. And it's a significant growth opportunity in that data and analytics space. And we see it already coming through in terms of AIQ sales that that have happened this year on the platform and just in the last two months of owning the business, we're seeing these analyzers getting picked up from our existing customer base. So those are two new areas that I'd say to focus on going forward as other areas of growth for this business. Thanks, Jeremy. And what I can say there is that we feel good about the position that we're at, with the assets that we have, I mean we literally our network touches every single part and aspect alone all the way from you as a consumer are thinking about it, you're going out and doing your research and touching the point of sale systems to engagement between that individual customer and the lender that they've chosen to do that loan with, the digitization of all the documents, and helping to automate that origination process, now interconnecting the originator to the settlement agent, and electronifying the close. So we have all the right pieces. As I mentioned, we focused very, very early on just making sure that we got the integration of these businesses mailed and executing on that. And we did very, very quickly to get the team all operating as one. And the other thing I'd point out is that a lot of the work we're talking about of pulling the networks together, of creating a digital the closing room, that didn't just start now. It started in the partnership that we forged with Ellie Mae back when we bought, Simplifile and Simplifile also had relationships with them that predated that. So a lot of this work is already underway. All that said, as I had mentioned in an answer earlier, I think it's underappreciated a little bit about how strong that network is that we have, having the largest network in the U.S., mortgage origination space. So with that position, we also see what our well the third-party vendors doing, what are the quality of the services that they provide. And we're in a unique position that if there is bolt-on opportunities that we think we can accelerate growth for entities by having them more directly part of our business as a bolt-on opportunity for us we would evaluate those. Sure, thank you for that. I'd say the major areas where we're different is I mean if you just look at industry assessments of market shares, and those market shares reflect the strength of the network that you have, the businesses that we have, have by far the largest network that stretches all the way from the inception of the origination, all the way through to closing. And I can't stress that enough but you need to think about that entire ecosystem from the inception of your thinking about loan, all the way through to documents get filed at a county courthouse to consummate a transaction between a buyer and the seller. So it's the strength of that network is first and foremost, one of the major differentiators that we have underneath that network, so not only on the origination side do we have by far a very big market lead in terms of the loans that we touch in the U.S. trending, getting up to a close to 50%, but also in the closing and post closed space with assets like Simplifile and MERS. Simplifile we've used the phrase that they went out and paved the road. So they went out and literally did the hard work of digitizing and digitally connecting thousands and thousands of counties around the U.S. to thousands and thousands of Attorneys that are in the middle of flash settlement agents that are in the middle of closing real estate transactions. The reason that Ellie Mae was such a strong network came and did a partnership with Simplifile, a few years ago is they acknowledged and realized that the piece of the network that Ellie Mae did not have, and the only entity that really had a digital highway, a digital network, to electronically close transactions was Simplifile. So that's a lot of the real differentiator, the other piece, I'd say is underneath the network, that's under appreciated the data sets that we have that are very unique within that business. So one of the things that Simplifile has by digitizing that network of all these settlement agents and all these counties, it is the only real repository in the U.S. that knows exactly what the settlement fees are, what the settlement requires, what the settlement requirements are for every real estate, just about every real estate transaction that happened in the U.S., with that type of information, you can use that information, pull it forward into the origination process and reduce a substantial amount of errors in the processing of loans by sharing that information very early on digitally sharing it. And then also including it with the analyzers that I was speaking about earlier, to be able to compare, what are the requirements that this county has on closing a particular transaction, versus what's getting pulled together and consummated in the origination package of that loan. So those are two of the main areas I would highlight as just substantial head starts in differentiators that we have that are very difficult for others to replicate. Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. And as Scott had mentioned in the question earlier around the re-segmentation of the business that will comment in the first half of December, that's when we're going to start giving more color on the revenue aspect of this. One part of your question, on the other side of it, just to give you some flavor of continued strides that we're making on the institutional space, the strategy really has three legs to it.

            "name": "Jeff Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott and good morning to everyone on the call. As I begin, I'd like to welcome the Ellie Mae team to their first ICE earnings call. While it's been less than two months since we closed on the acquisition in early September, I've been impressed by the collaboration between our teams during this short time and I am confident that the integration of Ellie Mae is off to a very strong start. I believe this is a testament to the talent of our respected employee population and our share of entrepreneurial cultures. Similar to our exchanges in fixed income businesses, Ellie Mae integrated into Ice Mortgage Technology as a network, a network that thrives by offering a value proposition that aligns growth with the efficiency gains that we bring to our customers. As we've seen across our network in futures, equity and fixed income, these efficiency gains are best achieved through harnessing unstructured data to create admission critical information, seamlessly linking participants to that information and ensuring that the network technology underpinnings are of the highest quality and security. It is the execution of this value proposition that often propels and analog to digital conversion of an industry and it's a blue print that we've applied across all of our businesses for over two decades. Turning now to Slide 7, open interest in our global energy business is currently up 9% year-over-year and with average daily volume in our flagship Brent crude oil contracts up 4% through September, energy revenues in total are up 15%. This growth further contributed to our average annual revenue growth of over 7% since 2015, growth is a direct result of staying close to our customers, understand their evolving essential needs, and expanding the breath of the content that we offer across our energy network. In our growth of natural gas markets, revenues were up 27% through the first nine months of 2020 led by continued growth of LNG and in particular, our European TTF natural gas benchmark, which continues to emerge as the Brent of natural gas. In addition, our environmental markets continue to grow with revenues up 12% year-to-date and up 7% in the third quarter. The globalization of natural gas and the growing adoption of environmental markets are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. With our Brent crude oil contract serving as the cornerstone of our energy network, we've expanded the range of content that we offer to our customers and today as a result of organic and inorganic investments, trading on our network is not tied to any one product or any one region. Thanks for the question, Rich. So the first thing we're thinking as Scott mentioned, and you alluded to, we're going to do a better job now of presentation so that you and our investors have visibility into how we're thinking about and running our business. Basically, as I think, you know since you've covered us for many years, we run network businesses, and we run businesses and look for opportunities where the next customer or the next product on that network becomes additive to everyone on the network and continues to compound revenue and earnings growth across that network as a result. And so we're feeling really good right now, if you look at our commodity business, futures business, open interest is up 9% year-over-year, when the markets are in contango, that's normally a signal or a precursor to volume and revenue growth in the future. So we're very, very happy with the way that business is performing. If you look at our fixed income and data business, you see that ASP, which is the future indicator of business is accelerating and compounding and as we've indicated you, if you look at our new mortgage network, which we're still combining with our other assets, it's double-digit both in subscriptions and in transactions, revenue growth and earnings growth for us in those businesses. So all of the segments that we're going to be showing you beginning in the fourth quarter are well positioned for 2021. And the reason that, that I like to end my prepared remarks on this graph that shows the long-term earnings growth of the company is that that's how we're running it and as a result of that mentality, this management team has a mentality that our job is to deliver EPS growth where we normally found that the stock will catch up to that growth. And we appreciate that many of the competitors and futures are interest rate and financial oriented competitors and they're struggling due to the interest rate environment. Many people in the data space don't have the global footprint that we have to find growth around the world and many people that are in the mortgage space don't have the market share gains that we've been able to gain, including just in the two months, since we've acquired Ellie that has continued to accelerate that business. So we're all those networks are very well positioned relative their peer group. And I think that will become apparent over time as this management team delivers bottom line results. Yes, it's a good question. We're right, we're in the middle of a transition. So there's a bit of fog, if you will, as to the timing of this transition obviously, regulators are pushing. But there are a lot of underlying business issues that have to get dealt with in the transition. So it's hard to know, a final date other than the trend is there. The sale of LIBOR as an index for us is a de minimis revenue. And there is a question as to how long LIBOR may survive after the industry does move to SONIA in order to pick up legacy business that that just couldn't be transitioned over. So, LIBOR make this for some time. And it's hard to know what that time is, because it's so pervasive around the world. And there are many, there are other LIBORs by the way, where LIBOR being dollar LIBOR but there are a lot of other LIBORs made, which were the calculation agent all which have the same issues. The transition is actually trading SONIA has accelerated our market share is very strong, we're probably north of 70% market share of all the trading in SONIA and so the market is getting comfortable with simultaneously trading SONIA based futures and LIBOR based futures. And, so we feel very, very comfortable and confident with where we've positioned our trading activities to be able to provide a bridge and if they two survive side by side for some time, we'll be a net beneficiary of that as well. Well, the one area that is really under discussion is the small and mid-sized regional banks and a whole range of products that that are not necessarily covered by is the swaps or hedged with swaps. And so what you're seeing is that having worked with the industry to come up with a common rule set on how the transition can go and you see that sort of institutional market coming up with game plans, but in the small and widely dispersed market, they're not in the swaps business and they've got, there are many people that have 30 year agreements that that have the word LIBOR in it. And so, we have been developing an alternative to LIBOR called the Bank Yield Index, which we published, we've been publishing it weekly, and people have been doing, academics have been doing white papers on it, to see how it tracks a credit based on environment. And we've now accelerated the publishing of that daily to create more data points, by the way for analysis. And it's very possible that there could be a transition away from LIBOR or for the credit space, part of the industry that is not SONIA and if so we have a very, very good benchmark that we're working on, that'll be up to regulators, and in a broad industry adoption if that happens. But there certainly is a lot of work going on underneath to try to at least have a viable alternative, should that needs or need arise. This is Jeff and one of the things that we really liked about business, when we started to think about putting together our network, our existing network, and the Ellie Mae network was that we've opened that network and so many of these companies that you may view as competitors use parts of our network in order to offer their services because our network is so comprehensive. And because it's open, and you can tick-off, you can join the network at the very beginning or all along the chain that we to a certain degree benefit from the entire growth of the industry, as partners, co-op petition, if you will, with many others in the industry. So that model is very compelling and that our goal is really, as I've said on the final slide that we land on is to really just grow our earnings per share not necessarily to completely crush every competitor. Thank you, Andrea, for moderating and thank all of you for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking to you again soon. And in the meantime, I guess I hope that you and your loved one stay safe and stay healthy. And with that, I hope to have a great day. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some year-to-date and third quarter highlights. Through the first nine months of 2020, we've generated record revenues, record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share, all of which have grown double-digit over a record year in 2019. This from business performance, allowed us to return $1.7 million of capital to our shareholders, 10% more than in the prior year and importantly, our solid financial position enabled us to invest $11 million to extend our mortgage network through the acquisition of Ellie Mae. For the third quarter, we generated earnings per share of $1.03 on net revenues of $1.4 billion. Data services revenue grew to a record $589 million an increase of 6% versus the prior year. Trading and Clearing revenues revenue totaled $711 million. Of note, our total mortgage revenue in the third quarter grew 62% on a pro forma basis versus third quarter a year ago, while ICE's total net revenues pro forma for Ellie Mae grew 7% year-over-year. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $611 million including $29 million related to Ellie Mae. Total expenses would have been roughly $7 million higher if not for some credits we don't expect to repeat in subsequent quarters. As we move into the fourth quarter, we expect marketing expenses to accelerate related to a robust IPO pipeline and the launch of back mobile consumer finance app. Combined with a full quarter of Ellie, which we expect will contribute around $105 million to $110 million we expect fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses in the range of $695 million to $705 million. And just interesting that price eventually catch up its value as demonstrated every share we've ever bought back in our repurchase program, a year later has been worth 20% more and two years later has been worth 40% to 50% more. And so it does catch up. I do think that the new segments will help. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we intend in early December to give you all some history with regards to how those segments will look back from 2018 and 2019, and year-to-date. So that you'll have that information early December. And as Jeff said, we'll present the company that way in the fourth quarter. And Ken you've seen historically, as you transition from one contract definition to a similar but different one, the impact tends to be as you near that transition point, you see a decline in the trading of the old and everyone's not quite moved into the new. And the good news for us is interest rates only make up about 4% of our revenue. So it's a relatively small impact regardless. Sure, thanks for the question, Dan. Yes. So look, the beat in the quarter was a couple of things clearly, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the SIP revenues related to the significant retail activity in the cash equities markets contributed to that. But the one that I've just been really happy with this year has been the pricing and analytics business, that's in a world where our sales team has been limited just like everyone else, in terms of travel ability to meet face to face, they're still crushing it, they've held productivity level versus the prior-year, they're on track to achieve I think it's like 98% or 99% of their signings objective. And that is what you'll remember I said will grow 5% to 6%, coming into the year, which is in February, before I even knew what COVID was is going to grow 5% this year, and the growth has accelerated each quarter. And it's going to grow again in the fourth quarter, and likely will be around 6% growth in the fourth quarter. So that business is doing phenomenally well. And it's a lot of factors, if people continue to consume more of our prices, as consolidation of vendors happens, we can be a one stop shop for people in their day to need, whether it's our data or feeds or network or all of that, we can sell. Our index business, I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're now up to $270 billion worth of assets that track our largely fixed income indices. So it's that pricing and analytics business that I'm so happy within. And then you ask about 2021. And while I won't give you dollar guide, I will point you to an ASV that was 4%, two quarters ago and is above 5% now and will trend higher in the fourth quarter. And so to me, that's I mean again, as you know, today that's 90% of our future revenue as we roll into the new segment or view that ASV will tactically be 100% of the forward revenue. And so if you've got an ASV number today, that's sitting between 5% and 6%. That says you're set up very well to deliver that type of revenue growth next year. So we feel very good about the execution of that business, very good about how the sales team has performed. I also mentioned coming into the year the fact that we were hiring into the growth opportunities we saw and we've done that hiring. But in a world where people aren't in the office, getting those that part of the team up to speed has been more of a challenge. The good news, though is that means we've had a good year this year without really a lot of productivity from the new folks. And as we move into next year, they'll join us at the higher productivity levels, and I think can give us an added boost. So that business right now is hitting on all cylinders. And we feel very good about not just the fourth quarter but about 2021. Right, and so I think that was three questions. So the tax rate will be in the 22% to 24% guide. So that's been consistent for the year other than the third quarter as we had to revert the U.K. back to 19%. So we would expect the fourth quarter will go back to kind of where we started the year. Obviously, as we roll Ellie and that's a U.S. based business, that'll put upward pressure on the tax rate, and be subject to whatever happens in the Election. But even that, I think you're modeling, I don't see a reason right now to move away from the 22% to 24%. I'm going to do the expense first, I think one of the things we like about this mortgage business is similar to our other businesses, it is scalable in the sense of the incremental dollars generate good incremental margins that notwithstanding, we're in a place where we're making a number of investments. As Ben alluded to in his answers with regards to be building on an closing room as one really good example. And so if you're looking at the fourth quarter, I think you need to take a couple of things into account, if you want to use that as run rate. Number one, for purchase accounting, we have to rebuild the CapEx and cap labor. And so with that run rate, you should probably another 20 on top of that. And then I would throw the 20 to 25 of investments, we're going to be making to not only grow the business next year, but more importantly, two months ago on the deal call, we said we thought it was a business that could grow 8% to 10% per decade. And so we'll make some investments again, that notwithstanding you do that math, and you'll see that it will still be very accretive to the bottom line, I think in the fourth quarter alone, it's going to be 7% accretive. So that's kind of on the expense side. I don't know that today is the day we'd say a whole lot more in terms of our guide on the revenue line. I still feel good about the 8% to 10%, we do for all the reasons Ben alluded to, as we move forward. We mentioned going in that we expected the refi to go back someone in an earlier questions said that the industry assessments were improving, but they're really just improving closer to where we already were, that those estimates tend to be a little bit pessimistic. So, again, we're only two months away from closing the deal. And having the call with you all, Ben has given a lot of color on why we love this business and why we believe it absolutely was the right investment. And so as I sit here today, two months later, I'm absolutely 100% still confident that it can grow the way we've talked about."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Intercontinental Exchange Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in listen-only mode.  After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, that this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nWarren Gardiner: Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2020 earnings release and presentation can be found in the investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2019 Form 10-K, second quarter Form10-Q and other filings with the SEC. \nScott Hill: Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our strong second quarter results. Net revenues totaled $1.4 billion, up 8%, driven by 13% growth in Trading and Clearing revenues and record data services revenues of $574 million, up 4% versus last year. This solid revenue performance combined with expenses at the low end of our guidance range helped deliver second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, up 14% over the prior year. We returned $564 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $400 million through share repurchases, and a nearly 10% increase in our dividend per share. Through the first half, we have returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends, an increase of 31% versus last year. As I mentioned, second quarter adjusted operating expenses of $575 million were at the low end of our guidance. COVID related impacts of the late IPOs, which reduce marketing spend at the NYSE. In addition, the high productivity of our technology team and reduce vacation due to COVID related travel restrictions drove higher capitalized labor expense during the second quarter. With a strong IPO pipeline and the reopening of many communities this summer, we expect these factors to begin to reverse in the third quarter, yielding an incremental $5 million to $7 million in expense. We also anticipate a modest ramp in strategic investments during the quarter, all of which is expected to result in third quarter adjusted operating expense in the range of $580 million to $590 million.\nJeff Sprecher : Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone on the call. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our customers who continue to turn to our global markets, data services and leading technology to navigate these unprecedented times. And I'd like to recognize my colleagues at ICE for their outstanding contribution to our first half results.  Now turning to Slide 7. Our records first half performance, which was highlighted by revenue growth of 15%, adjusted operating income growth of 19% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 25% is a testament to our asset class diversity, balanced mix of recurring and transaction based revenues, and ultimately the growth potential of our platform.  In our first full quarter of operating in a work from home environment, I'm very pleased to say that our team's responded. Driven by our multiyear investment in both information and technology, our data services business delivered a remarkably strong performance. We generated key wins with our pricing and reference data, where the quality of our end of day and real time fixed income prices attracted both new customers and increased consumption from existing customers. \nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. . And our first question will come from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRich Repetto : I guess, thank you for going through all the details on the open interest, the energy open interest. And I guess my question was, I'm just trying to differentiate, why yours and I know you went from natural gas being very strong, but why you're opening for, say, as separated from your peers. And if you think I'm right when I'm saying as of yet it hasn't played out in volumes. And is that sort of the view that you have, but it will later? Or could you sort of explain that? And maybe I just don't have the right picture?\nJeff Sprecher: Sure. What we've been doing over the last decade or so is really expanding the footprint of our energy futures markets. And obviously, we started when we acquired the international petroleum exchange of London that had four energy contracts, and today we have over 900, approaching 1,000. And so the growth that you're seeing is in the global markets, and it's in customers trading in these smaller niche contracts that give them more precision for hedging something locally or some product oriented to energy that is specific to their geography and business. And that\u2019s why I mentioned in my prepared remarks which is a third of our revenues now and energy come from these other energy products and they're the ones that are growing the fastest. They are correlated to the benchmarks, which is why it's important that we continue to market and push the main benchmarks, but the growth is in these other areas. And when energy markets are in contango, which for non-traders means the normal market conditions, where there is storage available in the world. We have always seen that open interest in these energy products is a good precursor to future volume trends. And actually, when the markets reverse and do what they call backwardate. This open interest becomes a four metrics. So one has to use open interest cautiously, but we see the opportunity for this business to continue to grow as customers come back to these open positions and manage them through the duration of their life. So it's a very bullish sentiment that we're using inside the company for our own forecasting.\nScott Hill: And the only thing I'd add to that is don't get locked in the overall totals with some of the dynamics going on underneath, because a lot of what Jeff just talked about is growing right now. So our other oil products are up 15%, year-over-year in July. Our natural gas products are up 5% year-over-year in July. Our emissions products are up 21% year-over-year in July. And you know, looking at our website, those are higher RPC contracts. So not only do we have the mitigation and commercials on the platform, not only do we have the mitigation of the diversity across the products, but the growth right now as mitigation to some extent against the revenue impact that we'll see. And as you know, you can't spend volume, you can spend revenue. And that's where the cash capital returns and things like that are afforded. So it just, I'd encourage you the things that Jeff went through in his prepared remarks, take a look at how those businesses performing because they're growing right through this.\nRich Repetto : Got it, and good great insight, especially on the you can\u2019t -- the volume translate into revenue. But anyway, my follow-up question, Jeff, was going to be on the ETF Hub. But I think your excitement in -- as you communicated, and talked about more of the -- just sort of the fact the sidetracked and diverted me let say. So I guess the question on mortgage services is that to the peers, right for digitization, automation, but there is a slight difference. I think from some of the markets, or maybe it isn't, maybe you can sort of draw the connection. With the other markets that you automated, there was certainly a matching engine, the exchange in trade and a massive platform here. It is maybe goes to the database management side of it. But it seems like you've just got some great tools that leverage this, potential for automation in this big market. But could you, I guess, draw -- give us a little bit more insight on the connection there? And maybe what the differences between that and say, the trading platforms that you've automated again and again?\nJeff Sprecher: Sure. It's a good question coming from you Rich because I know you and I have talked in a number of public forums about the fact that you've seen ICE really focused on the settlement process in the markets that we serve. In 2007, we moved into clearing our own futures products. And I think that was pivotal moment in the history of the company and a light went on for me in the management team and the board that we really can do something for this back office workflow that is incredibly sticky. So you've now seen with the ETF Hub and the way we're approaching the fixed income markets, we entered through the back office with the reference data initially, and now moving into the ETF Hub, which is a settlement, essentially, infrastructure. And we're using the same playbook in mortgage which is let\u2019s get into the settlement workflow, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks with MERS, right now, we touched almost all of the mortgages in the United States through what we've already built. And once you have that settlement scheme, it's easy to expand upstream and into the data business and into adjunct markets where that create value for customers that are very, very plugged into your network. And so think of what we're doing as, building the clearinghouse if you will for the mortgage industry.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. ASV growth improves sequentially this quarter to 4.5%. It is still at the low end of the range you set forth when you guys announced the IDC deal. Are we on the path forward to the midpoint of your range or maybe even at the higher end of the range? The backdrop on the transition to fixed income indexation seems to be coming together quite well. You would have indicated, more new account wins. So it seems like things are getting better you indicated towards the -- improving as you move through the year. So, is the outlook here, or what is the outlook here over the next couple of years for ASV growth? Should we expect it to continue to improve from these levels?\nScott Hill: Hey, Ken, its Scott. Thanks for the questions. Yes, look, I do think we certainly expect that our ASV growth will continue to accelerate as we move through the rest of this year. And by the way, I think in addition to the total ASV accelerating from the first quarter importantly pricing analytics, which is half the business move from three in the first quarter to four in the second quarter. And again, I expect that trend to continue as we move into the back half of the year. I said back in February, I thought price and analytics will grow 5% to 6%. I still think that's true for the year, which indicates I also think the revenue growth for price and analytics will accelerate in the back half versus the first half. And I think there are a number of trends that are really driving. And by the way, I've been given a shout out to Lynn and the team because they're leveraging those trends from home without travelling, without being able to go and meet customers face to face. And yet, we just had the best quarter of signings we've ever had. When it's told me she feels better about the pipeline entering the third quarter then she did entering the second quarter. And it goes to a lot of what Jeff was talking about. It's a flight back to quality on prices. We see customers consuming more of our prices. We see customers adding the names, adding our reference data because what we saw to the crisis is our prices were the De Facto price discovery. And in a world where you don't want tracking there, you've come to I say the services to buy those prices. That's what we're seeing. Our existing customers are buying more. We're seeing new customers join. Jeff talks about the index business, we now have $253 billion indexed against our indices, our fixed income indices. We went from single digits to nearly 20% share in that space in a very short period of time. And as Jeff said, that's still not $100 million business for us and it will be once. You look at the feeds business where that business didn't exist when we bought IDC five years later, it's approaching a $100 million in revenue and there we can compete not just on quality, but on price, because we're not protecting anything. We're going after new business, and we're seeing competitive wins, competitive wins against stable competitors and competitive wins against competitors that -- where customers aren't quite sure who owns them and who's controlling them at this point. So I think you're seeing all of those trends, a lot of that builds up in the quarter and allowed us to do a little better than the high end of our guide. It allowed me to mention in my prepared remarks that we're going to accelerate sequentially in the third quarter, and then again in the fourth quarter. And again, in a world where our sales team sitting at home, they're doing a fantastic job, and have allowed us to hold our guidance and to see acceleration in growth. So you're going to see it in revenue, you're going to see in ASV. And by the way, I feel very good about how it sets us up for 2021 as well.\nKen Worthington: Great, thank you. And then we have some distance between the challenging April WTI delivery in negative prices for TI that resulted. Has there been any noticeable fallout and at this point, do you think ICE might see a benefit in Brent trading from where participants switching to Brent? Or has that transition already happens, over the last decade?\nBen Jackson: Hi Ken, it\u2019s Ben Jackson. I'll take this one. So the short answer that question is yes. There is opportunity for Brent here and we're seeing it in a number of different areas. Jeff touched on one in some of his prepared remarks and in the first answer to Rich's question where I think that market participants have seen now firsthand a lot of the issues that can be created by that landlocked infrastructure on WTI versus the truly global demand pool that Brent has and can service. And what that's led to is not only growth in our Brent contract itself, but also in all of the refined products that come up with a barrel of oil, all the different locations where you can make and take delivery, which is very unique on our platform, where we have those hundreds and hundreds of different locations and refined products that customers can trade that are very deep and very liquid and are high growth opportunities for us. The other areas that we're seeing new opportunities for growth at Brent are for example, an ETF space. So we are having an unprecedented number of conversations now with ETF providers about having Brent for the first time. Another area we're exploring is retail demand. So retail in particular, in Asia, we're assessing what that opportunity is, but given some of the dislocations that happened in WTI, there are markets across Asia, that we're looking to expand and offer a retail offering for Brent. And then the third of the discussions around the Gulf Coast. So as I mentioned in Q&A in our last quarter, when oil hits the water coming out of the gulf, it price reference is most often Brent, so commercial customers are now engaging us more than ever around opportunities in the Gulf Coast around Houston related benchmarks and Gulf Coast related benchmarks. Bbecause Brent they see as the most logical benchmark to differentiate those contracts off of and create a differential market again. So we're engaged more than ever with commercial customers around what is that right, U.S. benchmark going forward and what changes may need to be made to them? So the short answer is yes, there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us and Brent.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Hey, good morning, everyone. Just wanted to follow-up on the mortgage discussion. Thanks for the detail here. I saw an industry poll in the mortgage industry the other day, that basically echo what you're saying in terms of digitization and the spending is going there that said, I think only 20% of that spend is going towards the closing portion, I think the majority is go to servicing and processing. And I think underwriting is a smaller part. So, first of all do you agree with that? It was an informal pull. But then if those other areas are getting more spending, how quickly can you expand from your base here? It doesn't have to be potentially inorganic, because, in terms of time to market?\nBen Jackson: Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. I'll jump in on this one. So I think Jeff went through in his prepared remarks that focus on the closing and post-closing process? And a lot you answered some of the question in the way that you framed your question. In that, the post-closing and closing process is the one that's the most ripe for innovation right now. It's been the most manual laden part of the entire process. And with the two assets that we have been very unique with MERS that we've talked about a lot and that with Simplifile as Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks having a very unique network and paved the road to all these different settlement agents and jurisdictions that no one else has, then that unique reference data set that we have. Puts us in a position for new growth opportunities that have a significant TAM, a billion dollar TAM across them. And to unpack how we're executing, how to think about that growth opportunity in front of us, and how easy it is and how now right in front of us it is, I'll give you a couple of examples. So first is with Simplifile, a key business be in e-record business. We've mentioned on calls that right now we're in jurisdictions and plugged into jurisdictions that represent 85% of the U.S. population. But in those jurisdictions, if you go back to 2019, we were only capturing on our e-record business about 25% of the eligible documents that we would take a pull on and we would get a fee on. You go to the first, accelerate to the first six months of this year and that has accelerated to 35%. So we've gone from 25% to 35% capture of what was manual and paper based documentation to now automated. A second example that we've talked about is e-notes. And Jeff mentioned this in his prepared remarks that we're doing about 3% of the MERS volume is now so when somebody's registering a mortgage, about 3% of those loans also include the registration of an e-note.  If you go back to last year, that was 1%. So we're seeing a nice pickup in acceleration there. And in addition to that, we're adding customers and have added customers like Ginnie Mae, Chase, Rocket, U.S. Bank onto this platform which gives us good visibility into a tailwind that will continue to grow that percentage. A third area of growth that we haven't talked about, is a business that Simplifile really builds organically by itself as a startup business. And that's the automation of the closing and post-closing process.  Think of this as very complimentary to what I just discussed that MERS has on e-notes and this is the automation of all the other elements of the closing and post-closed process. That business has gone from a start up to now if you use MERS volumes as a proxy during the first six months of this year, it's captured about 3% of that market. And we see similar to the e-note trend we're seeing adoption pick up significant customers onboarding onto that, and we have a very big TAM ahead of us there. The last thing I'd highlight is that while we have a bunch of other opportunities for growth in this market, the other thing that to look at is there's a very strong refi trend in the market, where each one of the services that we provide in every refinance that's done, we're collecting a transaction fee associated to each of those transactions. And if you look at where mortgage rates are -- if you look at where mortgage rates are now, there's an estimation from industry estimates that about 18.5 million outstanding mortgages are in the money at current rates. And in the money means they're 75 basis points lower than where rates are currently set. So we see ahead of us a significant refinancing boom, it's going to last for quite some time and with the Central Bank action that has happened, it's likely to continue in the years ahead. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nBrian Bedell: That's a good takeaway then in to my question on fixed income and credit broadly. Obviously the mortgage side of that has fantastic tailwinds. Can you talk about the revenue efforts within fixed income trading? And tell me, if this is accurate. Sounds like you've got faster near-term growth trends on the mortgage side. And we have a little bit of a longer term build on the fixed income trading side. And then if you can flesh how you see the revenue in that area, growing in the second half and then into next year. I think ETF Hub obviously has got great momentum, but I believe, correct me if I'm wrong, but if we do not charging much for that right now. And there's a more of a promotional game plan on that. So maybe if you could just flesh that part out of that?\nBen Jackson: So I think the way you characterize it is correct in terms of revenue. So with mortgage we obviously have had and have in front of us, near medium and long-term, a significant TAM to go after we're very well positioned to capture it and we're capturing it actively now. In fixed income, as I said, on the last few quarterly calls, what our play here has been on execution is to really establish a network for the first time, institutional network, leveraging the strengths that we have in our ICE data services business that has that institutional network, plugging into very inefficient workflows that are in the fixed income marketplace, and then combining our execution venues, our capabilities on the ICE data services side and plug it into these workflow inefficiencies to solve real world problems. And the first example of that, as we've talked about on calls is ETF Hub, and I gave a lot of great updates last quarter. A couple of things to look at in terms of network expansion and also volume expansion on that we've achieved this past quarter, because we've added our first three market makers onto the platform. So significant market makers like Jane Street, Old Mission, and Chicago Trading are now on the platform. Jeff mentioned in his remarks, we had two more AP significant ones in Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo that have joined the other five that are on the platform. We've added a new issuer as a development partner on the advisory committee in JP Morgan asset management. We continue to enhance our workflow automation capabilities in the custom basket facilitation or the ability to customize what are the securities that I can provide to somebody to swap for an ETF in that primary trading vehicle. And last but not least, volumes growth. So quarter-over-quarter our volume continues to grow in our primary trading venue. And we've done now over 330 billion in transactions since inception. What's ahead of us and getting to your question around execution, one of the key things ahead of us as I've mentioned on our last call that we just launched ICE Select and ICE Select is our aggregation venue of all of our protocols, all of our venues, as well as our rich ICE data services, data sets and analytics, like best execution and real time pricing. We've integrated all that into an aggregation venue, that in the coming weeks, it's going to be integrated into the ETF Hub. So for the first time, our venues will compete in the secondary market for flow to fulfill orders and procurement of bonds versus voice and other venues. And with the 330 billion that we've executed to date in the primary market, as a meaningful portion of the market that's out there for us to get started. Also ahead of us is really introducing for the first time our chat and instant messaging platform that's very well established in the energy and commodities markets, and introducing that for the first time into the fixed income markets. In late this year, we'll have international ETFs added on top of that. We will be in the latter part of the second half of this year, we will also start to share and publish on a regular basis volumes as our institutional network is starting to be established.\nScott Hill: And Brian, the only thing I want to add onto that because it gets overlooked a little bit its -- we've got a CDS business that did $100 million in revenue in the first half of the year, which is 20% higher than it was a year ago on track to be a $200 million business. So that's another fact similar to my answer to Rich, that I hope people don't miss because in a world where people are looking to hedge their credit exposures, they can do it, with the bonds themselves, but they're also turning more and more to CDS. And we built to Jeff's point earlier about building clearing solutions and back end solutions that facilitate risk management. We did that and that CDS clearing business and its performance through the first six months has been outstanding.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nSheriq Sumar: Hi, this is Sheriq filling in for Alex. You issued some long term debt in this quarter. Can you talk about the rationale for building up the little extra dry powder? And is there an opportunity to accelerate the share repurchase on the back of higher cash balances now?\nScott Hill: Yea, so look, we did -- we have some bonds that were coming due later this year. And we also had through some of the M&A activity that we've done a rather accelerate are higher balance in CP. Looking at the debt markets and look at the interest rates that were available, we thought it was a good time to move into the market and to turn some of the CP out and to go ahead and take out the bonds. And if you look, we actually those bonds that were due in December of \u201920. We're actually going to cost us more from a coupon standpoint than the blended money we got that averages out at 20 years maturity. So our blended costs on what we raised is a weighted average maturity of 20 years, and a cost of about 2.5% to 2.6%. That was lower than what we were paying on bonds that we're doing it at the end of the year. So we thought that was an opportune moment to move, reducing the CP piece a little bit of flexibility for us in terms of the revolver capacity that we have. And in uncertain period that we're in having some additional flexibility is good and it was a relatively inexpensive app to go out and get it. In terms of the repurchases, you know what you saw on the quarter is we were steady. We said originally 2.4 billion authorization from the board roughly covers six quarters at about 400 a quarter. That's what we did this quarter. Get a little bit more in the first quarter when the share price was a little bit beaten down. And given where we sit today that was a good move. So I would again, as is typically my answer over the last few years is steady as she goes on capital returns. We continue to grow our profitability, we continue to grow our capital returns, we continue to grow our dividend. And we'll continue to look that -- look to do that. And we will continue to look to the debt markets opportunistically to continue. As I mentioned, again, in my prepared remarks, another thing I want people to make sure that you don't notice, our return on invested capital is now back at 10%. And our weighted average cost-of-debt is now about 5.5. So, the overall balance sheet management has reduced that costs even as the business has generated increasing returns.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMichael Carrier: Good morning. Thanks for the question. You guys have been making good traction and you've talked a lot about some of the viewers that I included in ETFs Hub and mortgages. Ben, I think you mentioned, a large ATM ahead, how are you thinking about that, as longer term revenue opportunity? What maybe ICE is focused on? And given the potential piece of trash that you're seeing and it seems like in a little bit faster than you would have expected? How do you see that maybe be plan out relative to expectations?\nBen Jackson: Thanks, Mike. Similar to the answer I gave in the question a couple ago that Alex had. I think the way to think about it is that the real near-term revenue growth opportunities that are right in front of us that we're already capturing, is really in that mortgage services business and how well positioned we are for the automation of that closed and post closed process. Then especially with COVID, all the assets that we have went from nice to have assets to absolute must have assets. And we are onboarding customers at an unprecedented rate into our platforms for the registration of e-notes for getting onto Simplifile to plug into those more jurisdictions coming on board, more agents coming on board, and looking to rapidly, rapidly onboard onto these products and increasing adoption.  And as I mentioned, there's right in front of us, three to four significant growth opportunities that we're capitalizing on in terms of new business opportunities that we're capturing in that mortgage services business. For fixed income, we're establishing that network. It takes a while to get established into that institutional space for execution and all of the data points that I've been talking about on each of these calls, how fast we're getting this platform up the volume that's coming through the platform. How much of our network is already established. And as the network gets established, it really feeds on itself. So we think we're very well positioned there, for a medium to long term growth opportunity in execution. Remember in fixed income we don't look at it as just an execution business. To solve the real problems in fixed income it's going to require that billion dollar business a year that we have in fixed income that's really the cornerstone is our pricing our analytics business, and marrying those rich analytics and pricing services with execution and partnering with buy side and sell side clients to plug into real inefficient workflows because we're well positioned and that we're the only one that has really that comprehensive of all of the assets there to help solve them. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Maybe question on M&A, you highlight in your prepared remarks the diversity of your business. Just wondering if where you still see holes? Or where you're seeing more opportunities to add to your broader portfolio still, whether that's a mortgage or consumer through back through elsewhere? And then maybe also on update on what you're seeing the current M&A environment in terms of more or less opportunities say versus a year ago? \nJeff Sprecher: Sure. Well, I think it's a complicated environment. I had a very interesting conversation with one of the senior investment bankers in our space about the difficulty in two CEOs, meeting and getting to know each other and determining if their businesses would be good together where we're working from home and can't travel and can't have face to face conversation.  And so the M&A market as a result of that is much more about that we're seeing as much more about companies, particularly private equity owned companies that are going to run a process for their sale or merger. And in those kinds of situations, we are trying to be the most disciplined investor, Scott mentioned, we track our return on invested capital, we track our cost of capital. And so while it's easy to make M&A relatively easy to make M&A accretive due to the low interest rate environment that we're in, it's harder to make rational deals that have real long-term value creation for investors as opposed to giving our investors their money back and letting them make their own choices in the market. So it's complicated. That said, there are a lot of private equity owned businesses. So we've participated in a number of different, took a look at a number of different processes in the last quarter. And obviously, not done anything or we would have announced it. But I'm also seeing that COVID-19 environment has really created winners and losers in many spaces, including financial services. We have a lot of inquiries from in tech type companies that are worried about their future funding capabilities. These generally are companies that are loss making companies and built themselves to try to get scale in a world where there was a lot of capital freely floating around and now investors seem to be more disciplined and these companies are looking for larger sponsors, if you will, to both their businesses to. Again because we're disciplined investors and target things like accretion dilution return on invested capital.  Those deals are hard for us on a just purely financial basis. So we're only looking at things where we think those acquisitions would accelerate an initiative that we already are working on. And it's essentially a buy versus build strategy or a speed to market strategy. And those things are floating around, but again, and we've looked at a lot, but not seeing anything that really would move the needle for us. So long story short, we're in a very good position. We've got access to capital. We've got a lot of initiatives going on. Our productivity is high, because a lot of what we talked about on this call is about building, technology and systems to help our customers and interestingly, a tech focused firm can do well in this environment, because our people are actually being pretty productive, working from home. So we're in a great position. It's the right thing, where to come along. But it's a complicated environment for M&A just due to the social distancing that's going on.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nOwen Lau: Could you please give us more color on the progress of your partnership with MSCI? For example, the integration of ICE pricing and reference data into MSCI platform, and also the progress of launching more futures contracts based on MSCI index? Thanks.\nBen Jackson: Thank you very much. This is Ben, Owen. Our partnership with MSCI is very strong. It's been a long standing relationship that we continue to look for opportunities to grow, and we're going to continue to engage with them actively on a number of different indices and a number of different futures that we can launch around the world. It's obviously been a very strong growth business for us for a long time with the futures in that business. We've seen a little bit in recent times, with the volatility and the risk that there is in the market, we've seen a bit of a pullback, on things like emerging markets when you're in a high risk environment people tend to pull back from the markets when they're -- when you have that kind of volatility in it. But we've seen a 15% increase in Q2 in this business and a lot of that is on the back of the IFA business, which is another significant contract that we have. So we're looking at them actively, partnering with them on all kinds of view new growth opportunities, and the real estate relationship is very strong.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprecher: Well, thank you, Chuck for moderating the call. And I want to thank everybody for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you again soon until that happens I hope that you and your loved ones stay safe and healthy. And that you guys try to have a good day. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ben Jackson",
            "content": "Hi Ken, it's Ben Jackson. I'll take this one. So the short answer that question is yes. There is opportunity for Brent here and we're seeing it in a number of different areas. Jeff touched on one in some of his prepared remarks and in the first answer to Rich's question where I think that market participants have seen now firsthand a lot of the issues that can be created by that landlocked infrastructure on WTI versus the truly global demand pool that Brent has and can service. And what that's led to is not only growth in our Brent contract itself, but also in all of the refined products that come up with a barrel of oil, all the different locations where you can make and take delivery, which is very unique on our platform, where we have those hundreds and hundreds of different locations and refined products that customers can trade that are very deep and very liquid and are high growth opportunities for us. The other areas that we're seeing new opportunities for growth at Brent are for example, an ETF space. So we are having an unprecedented number of conversations now with ETF providers about having Brent for the first time. Another area we're exploring is retail demand. So retail in particular, in Asia, we're assessing what that opportunity is, but given some of the dislocations that happened in WTI, there are markets across Asia, that we're looking to expand and offer a retail offering for Brent. And then the third of the discussions around the Gulf Coast. So as I mentioned in Q&A in our last quarter, when oil hits the water coming out of the gulf, it price reference is most often Brent, so commercial customers are now engaging us more than ever around opportunities in the Gulf Coast around Houston related benchmarks and Gulf Coast related benchmarks. Bbecause Brent they see as the most logical benchmark to differentiate those contracts off of and create a differential market again. So we're engaged more than ever with commercial customers around what is that right, U.S. benchmark going forward and what changes may need to be made to them? So the short answer is yes, there's a lot of opportunity ahead of us and Brent. Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. I'll jump in on this one. So I think Jeff went through in his prepared remarks that focus on the closing and post-closing process? And a lot you answered some of the question in the way that you framed your question. In that, the post-closing and closing process is the one that's the most ripe for innovation right now. It's been the most manual laden part of the entire process. And with the two assets that we have been very unique with MERS that we've talked about a lot and that with Simplifile as Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks having a very unique network and paved the road to all these different settlement agents and jurisdictions that no one else has, then that unique reference data set that we have. Puts us in a position for new growth opportunities that have a significant TAM, a billion dollar TAM across them. And to unpack how we're executing, how to think about that growth opportunity in front of us, and how easy it is and how now right in front of us it is, I'll give you a couple of examples. So first is with Simplifile, a key business be in e-record business. We've mentioned on calls that right now we're in jurisdictions and plugged into jurisdictions that represent 85% of the U.S. population. But in those jurisdictions, if you go back to 2019, we were only capturing on our e-record business about 25% of the eligible documents that we would take a pull on and we would get a fee on. You go to the first, accelerate to the first six months of this year and that has accelerated to 35%. So we've gone from 25% to 35% capture of what was manual and paper based documentation to now automated. A second example that we've talked about is e-notes. And Jeff mentioned this in his prepared remarks that we're doing about 3% of the MERS volume is now so when somebody's registering a mortgage, about 3% of those loans also include the registration of an e-note.  If you go back to last year, that was 1%. So we're seeing a nice pickup in acceleration there. And in addition to that, we're adding customers and have added customers like Ginnie Mae, Chase, Rocket, U.S. Bank onto this platform which gives us good visibility into a tailwind that will continue to grow that percentage. A third area of growth that we haven't talked about, is a business that Simplifile really builds organically by itself as a startup business. And that's the automation of the closing and post-closing process.  Think of this as very complimentary to what I just discussed that MERS has on e-notes and this is the automation of all the other elements of the closing and post-closed process. That business has gone from a start up to now if you use MERS volumes as a proxy during the first six months of this year, it's captured about 3% of that market. And we see similar to the e-note trend we're seeing adoption pick up significant customers onboarding onto that, and we have a very big TAM ahead of us there. The last thing I'd highlight is that while we have a bunch of other opportunities for growth in this market, the other thing that to look at is there's a very strong refi trend in the market, where each one of the services that we provide in every refinance that's done, we're collecting a transaction fee associated to each of those transactions. And if you look at where mortgage rates are -- if you look at where mortgage rates are now, there's an estimation from industry estimates that about 18.5 million outstanding mortgages are in the money at current rates. And in the money means they're 75 basis points lower than where rates are currently set. So we see ahead of us a significant refinancing boom, it's going to last for quite some time and with the Central Bank action that has happened, it's likely to continue in the years ahead. So I think the way you characterize it is correct in terms of revenue. So with mortgage we obviously have had and have in front of us, near medium and long-term, a significant TAM to go after we're very well positioned to capture it and we're capturing it actively now. In fixed income, as I said, on the last few quarterly calls, what our play here has been on execution is to really establish a network for the first time, institutional network, leveraging the strengths that we have in our ICE data services business that has that institutional network, plugging into very inefficient workflows that are in the fixed income marketplace, and then combining our execution venues, our capabilities on the ICE data services side and plug it into these workflow inefficiencies to solve real world problems. And the first example of that, as we've talked about on calls is ETF Hub, and I gave a lot of great updates last quarter. A couple of things to look at in terms of network expansion and also volume expansion on that we've achieved this past quarter, because we've added our first three market makers onto the platform. So significant market makers like Jane Street, Old Mission, and Chicago Trading are now on the platform. Jeff mentioned in his remarks, we had two more AP significant ones in Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo that have joined the other five that are on the platform. We've added a new issuer as a development partner on the advisory committee in JP Morgan asset management. We continue to enhance our workflow automation capabilities in the custom basket facilitation or the ability to customize what are the securities that I can provide to somebody to swap for an ETF in that primary trading vehicle. And last but not least, volumes growth. So quarter-over-quarter our volume continues to grow in our primary trading venue. And we've done now over 330 billion in transactions since inception. What's ahead of us and getting to your question around execution, one of the key things ahead of us as I've mentioned on our last call that we just launched ICE Select and ICE Select is our aggregation venue of all of our protocols, all of our venues, as well as our rich ICE data services, data sets and analytics, like best execution and real time pricing. We've integrated all that into an aggregation venue, that in the coming weeks, it's going to be integrated into the ETF Hub. So for the first time, our venues will compete in the secondary market for flow to fulfill orders and procurement of bonds versus voice and other venues. And with the 330 billion that we've executed to date in the primary market, as a meaningful portion of the market that's out there for us to get started. Also ahead of us is really introducing for the first time our chat and instant messaging platform that's very well established in the energy and commodities markets, and introducing that for the first time into the fixed income markets. In late this year, we'll have international ETFs added on top of that. We will be in the latter part of the second half of this year, we will also start to share and publish on a regular basis volumes as our institutional network is starting to be established. Thanks, Mike. Similar to the answer I gave in the question a couple ago that Alex had. I think the way to think about it is that the real near-term revenue growth opportunities that are right in front of us that we're already capturing, is really in that mortgage services business and how well positioned we are for the automation of that closed and post closed process.

            "name": "Jeff Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning everyone on the call. Before I begin, I'd like to thank our customers who continue to turn to our global markets, data services and leading technology to navigate these unprecedented times. And I'd like to recognize my colleagues at ICE for their outstanding contribution to our first half results.  Now turning to Slide 7. Our records first half performance, which was highlighted by revenue growth of 15%, adjusted operating income growth of 19% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 25% is a testament to our asset class diversity, balanced mix of recurring and transaction based revenues, and ultimately the growth potential of our platform.  In our first full quarter of operating in a work from home environment, I'm very pleased to say that our team's responded. Driven by our multiyear investment in both information and technology, our data services business delivered a remarkably strong performance. We generated key wins with our pricing and reference data, where the quality of our end of day and real time fixed income prices attracted both new customers and increased consumption from existing customers. Sure. What we've been doing over the last decade or so is really expanding the footprint of our energy futures markets. And obviously, we started when we acquired the international petroleum exchange of London that had four energy contracts, and today we have over 900, approaching 1,000. And so the growth that you're seeing is in the global markets, and it's in customers trading in these smaller niche contracts that give them more precision for hedging something locally or some product oriented to energy that is specific to their geography and business. And that's why I mentioned in my prepared remarks which is a third of our revenues now and energy come from these other energy products and they're the ones that are growing the fastest. They are correlated to the benchmarks, which is why it's important that we continue to market and push the main benchmarks, but the growth is in these other areas. And when energy markets are in contango, which for non-traders means the normal market conditions, where there is storage available in the world. We have always seen that open interest in these energy products is a good precursor to future volume trends. And actually, when the markets reverse and do what they call backwardate. This open interest becomes a four metrics. So one has to use open interest cautiously, but we see the opportunity for this business to continue to grow as customers come back to these open positions and manage them through the duration of their life. So it's a very bullish sentiment that we're using inside the company for our own forecasting. Sure. It's a good question coming from you Rich because I know you and I have talked in a number of public forums about the fact that you've seen ICE really focused on the settlement process in the markets that we serve. In 2007, we moved into clearing our own futures products. And I think that was pivotal moment in the history of the company and a light went on for me in the management team and the board that we really can do something for this back office workflow that is incredibly sticky. So you've now seen with the ETF Hub and the way we're approaching the fixed income markets, we entered through the back office with the reference data initially, and now moving into the ETF Hub, which is a settlement, essentially, infrastructure. And we're using the same playbook in mortgage which is let's get into the settlement workflow, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks with MERS, right now, we touched almost all of the mortgages in the United States through what we've already built. And once you have that settlement scheme, it's easy to expand upstream and into the data business and into adjunct markets where that create value for customers that are very, very plugged into your network. And so think of what we're doing as, building the clearinghouse if you will for the mortgage industry. Sure. Well, I think it's a complicated environment. I had a very interesting conversation with one of the senior investment bankers in our space about the difficulty in two CEOs, meeting and getting to know each other and determining if their businesses would be good together where we're working from home and can't travel and can't have face to face conversation.  And so the M&A market as a result of that is much more about that we're seeing as much more about companies, particularly private equity owned companies that are going to run a process for their sale or merger. And in those kinds of situations, we are trying to be the most disciplined investor, Scott mentioned, we track our return on invested capital, we track our cost of capital. And so while it's easy to make M&A relatively easy to make M&A accretive due to the low interest rate environment that we're in, it's harder to make rational deals that have real long-term value creation for investors as opposed to giving our investors their money back and letting them make their own choices in the market. So it's complicated. That said, there are a lot of private equity owned businesses. So we've participated in a number of different, took a look at a number of different processes in the last quarter. And obviously, not done anything or we would have announced it. But I'm also seeing that COVID-19 environment has really created winners and losers in many spaces, including financial services. We have a lot of inquiries from in tech type companies that are worried about their future funding capabilities. These generally are companies that are loss making companies and built themselves to try to get scale in a world where there was a lot of capital freely floating around and now investors seem to be more disciplined and these companies are looking for larger sponsors, if you will, to both their businesses to.

We've got access to capital. We've got a lot of initiatives going on. Our productivity is high, because a lot of what we talked about on this call is about building, technology and systems to help our customers and interestingly, a tech focused firm can do well in this environment, because our people are actually being pretty productive, working from home. So we're in a great position. It's the right thing, where to come along. But it's a complicated environment for M&A just due to the social distancing that's going on. Well, thank you, Chuck for moderating the call. And I want to thank everybody for joining us. We look forward to speaking with you again soon until that happens I hope that you and your loved ones stay safe and healthy. And that you guys try to have a good day. Thank you."

            "name": "Scott Hill",
            "content": "Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our strong second quarter results. Net revenues totaled $1.4 billion, up 8%, driven by 13% growth in Trading and Clearing revenues and record data services revenues of $574 million, up 4% versus last year. This solid revenue performance combined with expenses at the low end of our guidance range helped deliver second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.07, up 14% over the prior year. We returned $564 million to shareholders during the quarter, including $400 million through share repurchases, and a nearly 10% increase in our dividend per share. Through the first half, we have returned over $1.4 billion to shareholders through both buybacks and dividends, an increase of 31% versus last year. As I mentioned, second quarter adjusted operating expenses of $575 million were at the low end of our guidance. COVID related impacts of the late IPOs, which reduce marketing spend at the NYSE. In addition, the high productivity of our technology team and reduce vacation due to COVID related travel restrictions drove higher capitalized labor expense during the second quarter. With a strong IPO pipeline and the reopening of many communities this summer, we expect these factors to begin to reverse in the third quarter, yielding an incremental $5 million to $7 million in expense. We also anticipate a modest ramp in strategic investments during the quarter, all of which is expected to result in third quarter adjusted operating expense in the range of $580 million to $590 million. And the only thing I'd add to that is don't get locked in the overall totals with some of the dynamics going on underneath, because a lot of what Jeff just talked about is growing right now. So our other oil products are up 15%, year-over-year in July. Our natural gas products are up 5% year-over-year in July. Our emissions products are up 21% year-over-year in July. And you know, looking at our website, those are higher RPC contracts. So not only do we have the mitigation and commercials on the platform, not only do we have the mitigation of the diversity across the products, but the growth right now as mitigation to some extent against the revenue impact that we'll see. And as you know, you can't spend volume, you can spend revenue. And that's where the cash capital returns and things like that are afforded. So it just, I'd encourage you the things that Jeff went through in his prepared remarks, take a look at how those businesses performing because they're growing right through this. Hey, Ken, its Scott. Thanks for the questions. Yes, look, I do think we certainly expect that our ASV growth will continue to accelerate as we move through the rest of this year. And by the way, I think in addition to the total ASV accelerating from the first quarter importantly pricing analytics, which is half the business move from three in the first quarter to four in the second quarter. And again, I expect that trend to continue as we move into the back half of the year. I said back in February, I thought price and analytics will grow 5% to 6%. I still think that's true for the year, which indicates I also think the revenue growth for price and analytics will accelerate in the back half versus the first half. And I think there are a number of trends that are really driving. And by the way, I've been given a shout out to Lynn and the team because they're leveraging those trends from home without travelling, without being able to go and meet customers face to face. And yet, we just had the best quarter of signings we've ever had. When it's told me she feels better about the pipeline entering the third quarter then she did entering the second quarter. And it goes to a lot of what Jeff was talking about. It's a flight back to quality on prices. We see customers consuming more of our prices. We see customers adding the names, adding our reference data because what we saw to the crisis is our prices were the De Facto price discovery. And in a world where you don't want tracking there, you've come to I say the services to buy those prices. That's what we're seeing. Our existing customers are buying more. We're seeing new customers join. Jeff talks about the index business, we now have $253 billion indexed against our indices, our fixed income indices. We went from single digits to nearly 20% share in that space in a very short period of time. And as Jeff said, that's still not $100 million business for us and it will be once. You look at the feeds business where that business didn't exist when we bought IDC five years later, it's approaching a $100 million in revenue and there we can compete not just on quality, but on price, because we're not protecting anything. We're going after new business, and we're seeing competitive wins, competitive wins against stable competitors and competitive wins against competitors that -- where customers aren't quite sure who owns them and who's controlling them at this point. So I think you're seeing all of those trends, a lot of that builds up in the quarter and allowed us to do a little better than the high end of our guide. It allowed me to mention in my prepared remarks that we're going to accelerate sequentially in the third quarter, and then again in the fourth quarter. And again, in a world where our sales team sitting at home, they're doing a fantastic job, and have allowed us to hold our guidance and to see acceleration in growth. So you're going to see it in revenue, you're going to see in ASV. And by the way, I feel very good about how it sets us up for 2021 as well. And Brian, the only thing I want to add onto that because it gets overlooked a little bit its -- we've got a CDS business that did $100 million in revenue in the first half of the year, which is 20% higher than it was a year ago on track to be a $200 million business. So that's another fact similar to my answer to Rich, that I hope people don't miss because in a world where people are looking to hedge their credit exposures, they can do it, with the bonds themselves, but they're also turning more and more to CDS. And we built to Jeff's point earlier about building clearing solutions and back end solutions that facilitate risk management. We did that and that CDS clearing business and its performance through the first six months has been outstanding. Yea, so look, we did -- we have some bonds that were coming due later this year. And we also had through some of the M&A activity that we've done a rather accelerate are higher balance in CP. Looking at the debt markets and look at the interest rates that were available, we thought it was a good time to move into the market and to turn some of the CP out and to go ahead and take out the bonds. And if you look, we actually those bonds that were due in December of '20. We're actually going to cost us more from a coupon standpoint than the blended money we got that averages out at 20 years maturity. So our blended costs on what we raised is a weighted average maturity of 20 years, and a cost of about 2.5% to 2.6%. That was lower than what we were paying on bonds that we're doing it at the end of the year. So we thought that was an opportune moment to move, reducing the CP piece a little bit of flexibility for us in terms of the revolver capacity that we have. And in uncertain period that we're in having some additional flexibility is good and it was a relatively inexpensive app to go out and get it. In terms of the repurchases, you know what you saw on the quarter is we were steady. We said originally 2.4 billion authorization from the board roughly covers six quarters at about 400 a quarter. That's what we did this quarter. Get a little bit more in the first quarter when the share price was a little bit beaten down. And given where we sit today that was a good move. So I would again, as is typically my answer over the last few years is steady as she goes on capital returns. We continue to grow our profitability, we continue to grow our capital returns, we continue to grow our dividend. And we'll continue to look that -- look to do that. And we will continue to look to the debt markets opportunistically to continue. As I mentioned, again, in my prepared remarks, another thing I want people to make sure that you don't notice, our return on invested capital is now back at 10%. And our weighted average cost-of-debt is now about 5.5. So, the overall balance sheet management has reduced that costs even as the business has generated increasing returns."

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, that this event is being recorded. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference over to Warren Gardiner, VP of Investor Relations. Go ahead.\nWarren Gardiner: Good morning. ICE\u2019s first quarter 2020 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay.\nScott Hill: Thanks, Warren. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, we want to offer our hope that you your colleagues and your families are staying safe and remain healthy, during this unprecedented time. I'll begin this morning on Slide 4, with some of the key highlights from our record first quarter results. First Quarter net revenues totaled $1.6 billion up 23% year-over-year, driven by record trading and clearing revenues of $883 million and record data services revenues of $564 million. It's worth noting that this quarter started with January yielding what at the time was the best revenue month in our history. That record was nearly equal during February. While growing uncertainty related to COVID further increased our customers demand for price discovery and risk management in March. It is our customer focus and our investments in both sales resources and product innovation that generated the high-retention rate and growth in open interest, which lays the foundation for our record performance even prior to March, and which supports our ability to continue to grow once the impacts of COVID subside.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone, on the call. Before I begin my remarks on Slide 7, I want to express our sincere hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I'd also like to take a moment to thank my colleagues at ICE for the resilience and the dedication that they've exhibited over the last few months, and importantly, thank our customers, who now more than ever, put their trust in our people and our technology to manage their risk across asset classes around the world. Business continuity planning has always been paramount at ICE. Being prepared for managing risk is our business, and it's in our DNA. A number of years ago, we started building large scale remote capacity with a robust cyber overlay, so that our employees could work from home for extended periods of time. This meant equipping them with portable technologies, building secure virtual desktop environments, and being prepared to supply important equipment out of our own inventory.\nOperator:  Our first question is from Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Go ahead.\nRich Repetto: Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Scott. I guess my question, Jeff, is can we get your perspective or your views on the energy and the crude oil market right now, and the issues that are going on with the pricing? How do you expect Brent to price you know as the next contract expires and any color that you could give us a to educate us more on that marketplace?\nJeff Sprecher: Sure, happy to Rich. Well, first of all, WTI, West Texas Intermediate crude oil, as many of you know as crude oil delivered in pipelines at Cushing, Oklahoma on a specific day, and there's local storage there. When there are pipeline problems or storage problems or problems on a specific day, that particular price discovery can reflect those problems. And that's what people believe have happened with the negative pricing at WTI earlier this month. But, I will say that we are aware that there are investigations going on to satisfy the market, the price discovery that happened on that day at that moment and that place, is truly representative. So, we look forward to the outcome of that. Brent is slightly different, and I'll explain a little bit at a high-level and then maybe ask Ben Jackson to help me augment some of the details. But there's a lot more cushion, if you will, built into the way Brent operates. First of all, it's a global contract. And so it's really looking at global capacity, global shipping capacity, global port capacity, global storage capacity, because the oil is seaborne. And as you know, I think Rich, it is a cash settled contract that settles against an index, that is an index that ICE generates itself by looking at what is considered the physical market called the Dated Brent market. And, we look at cargoes that are exchanged hands between major oil companies, these tend to be trades of a full cargo, ship cargo or a half a ship cargo that trade around the world, as the oil companies are trying to manage the delivery out of Deepwater Derrick, shipping availability, port availability and storage around the world. Those cargoes are traded to keep that whole physical infrastructure in check and balance. And those are the cargoes that we look at and create an index. If there are anomalies in trading, we have the right to question those anomalies and either ask for more information or disregard them or adjust them. So, there's human judgment that goes into that. And lastly, the Brent index, the Brent crude oil contract, the futures contract that we trade does not deliver on a day. It is a forward looking delivery period that has more cushion in it than we have at West Texas Intermediate crude oil. So, once long short, it's more global, it's more diversified, has more buffer and has human judgment in it, all of which can help alleviate some of the near-term stress that happens compared to WTI, where you have a moment in time and local infrastructure. In my mind, Richards, why WTI has always been a more speculative trader oriented contract, because people like to try to figure out those local issues and trade around them, and people with good judgment and good information can speculate around what's going on locally. Brent is a more global and more commercially used contract, because it's more closely reflects what's happening around the world. Ben, do you have anything that you'd like to augment?\nBen Jackson: Sure, I can add a little more to that. And thanks for the question Rich. So, Jeff hit it very well around one of the core differences between the two contracts as one's global in nature, one's very local and landlocked. With WTI as Jeff said, there's well-publicized structural issues at Cushing. Infrastructure issues have happened in the past with pipeline and storage issues that create volatility in delivery. And as Jeff also said, the major difference between that and Brent is the Brent of waterborne contract, where it's much easier to low crude on the vessel and bring it anywhere in the world where there's demand and the economics makes sense. So you'll see a huge demand pool that you're servicing with the Brent contract, and you don't have those fundamental landlocked structural constraints on the contracts. The other difference has not talked about as much, and Jeff touched on this briefly, is that WTI is a spot month contract. It expires right when the delivery schedules at Cushing are being set. For example, the June contract expires on May 19, with only a couple days left of scheduling to happen on the Cushing infrastructure for deliveries. For the Brent contract, it's much more of a forward contract. So if you take that example of the June contract as well, that contract expires a full month before. And actually today is the expiration day of the Brent, June contract. So the full month between that and the contract is much less susceptible to issues that you'd see that can happen around infrastructure related issues or constraints that you'd see in a landlocked contract like WTI. The other big difference to just highlight quickly Rich is, because there was some misinformation put out there recently, around the concept of Dated Brent. And we give customers, yes, we give customers the choice of Dated Brent versus Brent to hedge. Dated Brent is a true spot month contract. So that price has cargoes all the way going up to the delivery month. Dated Brent versus Brent are two very different contracts, and there's a spread relationship that develops between those two contracts that does trade because they are very different. Dated Brent are spot contract. In that contract, we see that 85% of the open interest in that contract are professional, large commercials that are all over the delivery process that's happening in crude oil. So it's a heavily, heavily commercially oriented contract. And Brent, Dated Brent trade as a spread to one another just like WTI front month to WTI second month trade as a spread to one another. But I can say that Dated Brent, the Brent never blew out anywhere near to the degree that WTI did in the past week, where the spread between WTI front month to back month went from $58 to $59, and at that same period Dated Brent to Brent was around $5. It's these recent and past moves in WTI versus Brent, that have shown that WTI can be a riskier contract to risk manage. And that's why customers overwhelmingly select Brent to manage their risk. They also select Brent as really the basis and pricing mechanism to price all kinds of refined products, that we talk about oftentimes is one of the fastest growth areas of our business, which is our other oil complex. So these are refined products like gas oil, bunker fuels, jet fuels, gasoline, they all trade relative to Brent and they all trade in a global nature in areas around the world such as Europe, Asia, and North America and it's one of the fastest growing parts of our complex. This is why, if you look at the overall oil complex, our market share and overall oil from an open interest perspective is 64%, up from 55% just a couple of years ago. And in ADV terms, our market share is 56%, up from 45% in recent past. We're grateful that our customers are coming to us now more than ever to help manage their risk in this turbulent time.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Kramm from UBS. Go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to shift gears to the data side little bit. I think you gave a decent amount of color already, but obviously, data guide unchanged. So Scott, or anybody else, would be very happy to hear a little bit more why you're so confident? And also what you've been seeing, I guess with sales teams displaced, working from home? And how you feel like that will change over the course of the year to still make your guidance? And then very quickly related to that, if you think going forward, I mean, the majority of that business is pricing analytics and fixed income. So with everything that we've seen here with everyone being displaced, I would just assume that it's going to get harder to get prices by calling dealers. So just curious, if you feel like this is actually an area of incremental demand coming out of this kind of crisis that nobody expected. Thank you.\nBen Jackson: Yes. It's a good question, Alex. Thank you. Let me start with what I don't know. I don't know exactly, when the world goes back to work, whether that's second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, early 2021. I don't think it'd be useful for you. I don't have an economist on staff to tell you that it could be fast or slow or anywhere in between. So, I don't have great visibility into exactly when things open up. But I have a lot of visibility into fact that give me confidence. So one of the things, I've got confidence based upon is I look at the pipeline and talk to Lynn and her sales team. And the pipeline remains really robust. And so the opportunity exists to sell into that pipeline and to generate revenue, that as we sit here today, we believe are consistent with the original data guide that we provided. I look at ASV that's up 4%. And if you do just the straight math on that ASV number, it lands you right on top of where we're guiding in the second quarter, and I think provides a firm foundation as we move into the third and fourth quarter. I listened to Lynn and our team talk about phone calls we got in the middle of the crisis from customers. We're thinking about or had moved away to one of the other competitors, and realized that the tracking error on the prices from those peers were significantly greater than the tracking error on our prices that are coming back to us. I know we were able to close a couple of key deals, but those deals didn't sign due to the work from home, which is not a loss revenue, it's just a delay, which I think can also help us in the back-half of the year. So in the very near-term, I see a lot of positives that give me confidence as we move into the back-half of the year. I think more importantly, the key thing, key message I'd like to get across is there's nothing that's happened in the last month or two or three that changed the medium to long-term prospects of this business, and our ability to generate 4% to 6% revenue growth. So, no matter what happens in the third or fourth quarter or early in the next year, this business is set up to grow well, for exactly the reason that you indicated. It is a business that provides mission critical information into the fixed income market. In fact, I've heard a number of our customers say, during the crisis price discovery in fixed income came from us. And I think that's going to be even more important as we get to the other side of this crisis. I think the demand for fixed income investment will continue to grow. I think the evolution of indices and ETFs will continue to generate demand on prices. And we're going to be there to serve it. And then the last data point that I would give you, that gives me confidence is we look back after 2000 and 2001, the IDC business grew greater than 4%. We look back after 2008, 2009, the IDC business grew greater than 4%. And that was when it was just prices. Today, its prices and reference data in fixed income and a strong network. And by the way, it's supplemented by a futures exchange business that between 2009 and 2012 also grew high-single digits coming out of the financial crisis. So, in the near-term, it's hard to call what exactly the numbers are going to be in the back-half, but I'd keep that in perspective as well. Because, even to the extent we're off a little bit we're talking about $0.02 to $0.03 a share on earnings well above $4, so it's something less than a 0.5% of earnings in the near-term. And a long-term model still positioned very well to grow 4% to 6%.\nJeff Sprecher: Alex, this is Jeff. I'll give you one interesting -- interesting to me, at least, anecdotal piece of information that surprised me. And that was that our sales people in data have targets and budgets, as you can imagine. And our people in Asia were hit with work from home very early in the quarter, a lot of dislocation in our customer base in Asia. And yet we could see they were meeting or exceeding their sales targets. And so while, the sales call itself became very, very difficult on our people, the demand became very, very strong. And between that dislocation, our sales people and our customers figured out how to do business with one another and get things done. So we very early in the quarter felt pretty good about where we were heading before the lockdowns hit Europe and the U.S. And so I feel somewhat confident that our entire market is figuring out how to adjust to this -- I'll call it new normal of working from home.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. I guess, shifting back to the energy markets. I was wondering if you could kind of discuss the health of your customer base with oil at the current prices and talk about the commercial component in particular? And then just a point of clarification, because WTI is seaborne now, and just wondering if Brent, I mean they're facing the same supply issues at WTI is in the lack of demand. So just curious, you talked about the seaborne versus cash settled in some of the differences. But with WTI being now seaborne, does that alleviate some of that delta or variance between the two contracts?\nBen Jackson: Thanks, Dan. This is Ben again. So on the latter part of your question there around WTI being seaborne, the reality is when you look in the physical market, when those barrels and when that oil hits the water, it's most often priced by a Brent, that's when it becomes Brent. So that's one of the major differences and it doesn't stop or prevent any of the issues that you see around, the infrastructure related issues around storage or pipeline capacity to get oil actually to the coast. So that's one. On the customer base itself, couple of quick comments on that. So on every earnings call, you've either heard Jeff, Scott or myself for many, many years, talk about that, since the inception of our futures business, we've really had the corporate commercial customer at the heart of our business. Those are customers that have real directional price risk. And whatever commodity is they're consuming or that they're producing in the physical markets. And what the futures markets are intended to do for them, as all of you know, is to hedge that risk if prices move against them, and to protect them in turbulent times. And we partnered with our customers very differently than others have and built out this suite. As Jeff mentioned in his prepared comments, hundreds and hundreds of oil products around the world. We have many, many different natural gas products around the world, power contracts around the world that help our customers hedge. So, we're grateful. What we can say right now is that we're grateful that our customers are coming to us now more than ever. The evidence is showing to help them manage their risk in these turbulent times. We saw open interest records in March. Open interest is the best sign of customers coming to you and showing that they're putting on positions for a period of time to manage their risks. In April, we\u2019ve seen it grow on a year-over-year basis as well. We're seeing open interest across natural gas, across oil, continuing to build in longer dated positions, which basically means positions that aren't for necessarily expiry next month, but positions that are going expire in December of this year or 2021 or 2022. And people that are tend to put on those longer dated positions are commercials that are in fact hedging their exposure to price risk. Commercials represent about 44% of the open interest in contracts like Brent. Also our Henry Hub contract's more than double our closest peer in their benchmark products that they have. The only thing I'd say is if you look at other evidence point I'd look at, is if you look at past times of stress, so you look at times when 09/11 happened, when the financial crisis hit, when Shell oil came exploding onto the scene. Brent ADV grew every single time in the 12 month period after that crisis hit, compared to the 12 month period prior to that crisis and open interest either held or grew. Now all that said, we're mindful that every day there's real stress in the marketplace that our customers are feeling. And the fact that they're coming to us more than ever to hedge their exposure to price risk in these volatile times is what our markets were fundamentally built for. And we're going to continue to partner and help our customers through this.\nOperator: Our next question is from Michael Carrier from Bank of America. Go ahead.\nMichael Carrier: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Scott, just a question on how you're looking at expense and capital management this backdrop. So on expenses, you actually give a range, how much of the base will flux to say like a quick return  versus a longer delay, and whether that's operationally or whether that's travel and those types of items. And then thinking on capital return, do you see any shift given the current backdrop? Thanks.\nBen Jackson: So Michael, you were a little bit unclear in the question. I think what you were asking, the latter part was on capital return, which I'll touch on, and on the former part with expense management in the challenging environment. That's the question I'm going to answer. Hopefully, it's right. So, first of all, the way we're thinking about expense is it's consistent in terms of where we thought coming into the year. And the reason for that is we think it's really important to continue to invest in our business as we move through 2020. And the strong performance across our business allows us to continue to do that. It's important that we continue to invest in ETF hub.  Jeff talked about some of the milestones that we hit in that, it's important to continue to invest in building out our mortgage solutions. That's a business that when we bought it was $140 million revenue stream that now is on track to be $170 million plus. And you, I'm sure read the articles about the need for that business to automate beyond where it is today. So, we're going to continue to invest in that. We're going to continue to invest in the data sales team. We talked about growth in the European sales team and challenges in the fourth quarter. That business in Europe went from a decline in the fourth quarter to growth in the first quarter. And we continue to invest in the sales team, because when customers are ready to start taking the meetings, or as Jeff alluded to, if they want to do deals over the phone, we want to make sure that we've invested in the sales team that's necessary to deliver on that. And so our expense guidance is consistent, because we believe that this business is well-positioned to continue to grow this year and beyond. And it's important that we continue to feed the growth engine with the investments on the expense side. Now, having said that, you'll note that in our original guidance, we had $15 million to $25 million of expense efficiencies that we were counting on, and we will certainly deliver those. We absolutely do have flexibility if things get significantly worse as we move through the year. For a long time, a big part of our compensation system is paid for performance. And so to extent that the business performance starts to slow, we've got a natural break that happens on comp expense, which is half of our overall expense. But as we sit here today, Jeff alluded to, our employees did a phenomenally good job from home, delivering the markets, the risk management tools that our customers needed. And again, we're very confident in the future of this business and don't want to cut off the investments that are necessary to generate future growth. In terms of capital return, you know, we mentioned in the quarter that we spent -- our dividend grew 9% in the first quarter. We just announced our second quarter dividend, it's similar growth. That\u2019s a dividend that's grown double digits every year since we announced it back in 2013. And in addition to kind of what I'll call the run rate $400 million of buyback, we spent $300 million in addition. And I will tell you that the $300 million was spent in our open window in largely around the disconnect that happened around the eBay leak, earlier in the quarter, where once again, we felt like the market had completely mispriced our company. And we felt it was appropriate to opportunistically repurchase shares. That window ended before the COVID crisis really hit. But as we said, we bought it about $92 a share and those shares sit around $92. As we move forward, I think you should continue to expect us to return 100% of the capital that we don't need for M&A, that extra $300 million we spent in the first quarter. We still were at our leverage target. We'll obviously continue to monitor that as we move through the year. But given the strength of our cash flows, I would anticipate you'll see our routine 400 a quarter of share buybacks continue. You'll see the dividends continue at its current levels, which is growing year-over-year. And our overall approach is not different to capital returns. Last point, I'd make on capital, because I think it's important to note that within the first quarter, not only did we spend an extra $300 million on buyback, we also spent nearly $300 million helping back to acquire Bridge2 Solution, and yet our leverage was still at 2.3 times, which is a complete testament to the strength of the cash flows of this business.\nOperator: Our next question is from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Just a two part question, one, just to go back on the data side and some of the -- you know thanks for the color on a lot of the anecdotes there. Are you seeing any questions about price concessions as some companies struggle to reduce costs? And then unrelated to that on the energy side, if you can just remind us they're roughly, the rough portion of users that are commercial hedgers, within your mix versus financial players on the energy side?\nJeff Sprecher: Yes. I got it. This is Jeff. On data what we're seeing is, the sale of the NYSE, U.S. equities tape is a very mature business, and not so much that there's pricing pressure. There's just consolidation I think in the way, at least, historically before this crisis, there had been ongoing consolidation in asset managers. And that really wasn't as much price as it was number of customers. But the rest of our business, we're seeing this huge demand and has really no price pressure on it, in the sense that there's a rotation away from desktop terminals, fixed terminals. As you can imagine, when you work from home, people are looking for lightweight, portable, easy to access, secure information and that's really a technology delivery issue that we are very good at, because of our investment in technology, because we're prepared to give you information in any form you want it, we've been able to move quickly to fill kind of this new need. I think we're demonstrating to a lot of people that, because we had so much capacity in our systems that on these extremely volatile days, our data was able to keep up and our analytics were able to deliver results, where we heard anecdotally that a number of our competitors that may have had lower prices or people that had moved to them for other reasons, wish that they hadn't done that. And we saw people come back to reengage with us, which was a very warming feeling for our sales teams. So, long story short, no, not a lot of price pressure. Much more about can I get the right information at the right place at the right time, and can I rely on it? And, that's what we're good at.\nScott Hill: Right. And just before Ben picks up on that question, the only other thing I would add, as I mentioned earlier is, we're not just selling prices anymore. Now with customers that need the prices and the reference data and indices, and as Jeff alluded to, the connectivity. It's a full sale solution that we have. And so, it tends not to be as much about the price of any one element, but how well we can bundle that package together to meet their needs.\nBen Jackson: And on the second part -- let me get the second part of the question that Brian had asked around mix. So in the comments that I made on the past couple of questions, I dropped in a couple of statistics there. But I think the key thing there to really frame your mind is that we are heavily commercially oriented, much more so than our closest peer. Both Brent, as well as our Henry Hub are two perfect examples. We're about 44% of the open interest is commercials. And when you do that same analysis WTI and Henry Hub at one of our peers, you're going to see that that's more than double what they have. So it's heavily commercially oriented. It's the commercial traders that we cater to and have really built our markets around. The second biggest segment of the marketplace would be swap dealers, banks that are selling structured products too and commercials. So you'll see that that is a lot of the trading activity and hedging activity that we see. I think one other interesting data point for you it's just Henry Hub alone. So, for one of the things that we've seen is with Shell oil production coming down in the U.S., well, oftentimes when Shell oil is being drilled, a byproduct of that is natural gas coming out of the ground in the U.S. And producers, you know, customers have acknowledged and seen that like gas production is starting to slow, and it's introduced some volatility into the basis markets in the U.S. But what we've seen is that customers are coming, very significantly to our basis markets as much as they ever have, where they manage 100% of their risk in the basis markets that we manage. And then secondly, they oftentimes trade not only the basis markets, but they put on longer dated Henry Hub positions, which is much more the longer dated positions, longer expiries is much more where the commercials play and manage their risk. And that has historically, since the inception of the company and starting our Henry Hub contract has been the part of the market that we have service. Because of those trends, we\u2019ve seen Henry Hub market share in open interest terms added 10 year high right now, with 46% market share in Henry Hub. So, we\u2019re seeing customers more than ever come to manage their exposure to price risk in our markets, which is what futures markets were built for.\nOperator: Our next question is from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi, thank you for taking my question. I'd love to continue the discussion on gas. The Dutch Gas business continues to do particularly well. Open interest has doubled year-over-year . What is the addressable market here, because that business continues to do exceptionally well and it's a high fee product? And in the resurgence of U.S. nat gas, again, the follow-up on your comments there. We've seen nat gas OI continued to build both in the futures and options side. Options activity got killed last year that's rebounded. And you mentioned, gas OI was at 10 year-highs. Why is that happening now? The Shell issue has been or opportunity has been going on for quite a while. And gas had sort of suffered while that business was growing, but we've seen a real resurgence. So anyway, could you further flush out your comments on the rebound we're seeing on the U.S. gas side?\nBen Jackson: Sure. Thanks, Ken. This is Ben again. So one of the things we've been watching is with this pandemic, will that impact people's transition, and in particular in Europe and Asia to cleaner fuels and will that slow it down. And what we've seen is that it hasn't. I mean, as we've engaged with all of our commercials and commercial customers, and also the fact that the price of natural gas and LNG for example is low. We're seeing that transition to cleaner fuels is still really invoke in Europe and in Asia. And that's what led to the growth that you just referenced in TTF. And we continue to see tremendous growth in our JKM contract. There still is a decent amount of that market that trades in the OTC space. So there's a lot of runway to go still and bringing more of that business to futures. And more and more customers each month, as we look at the volume that's trading the OTC market versus futures. Customers are continuing to see the benefit of trading in the futures markets. And we're seeing that continue to shift and move more and more towards the future side of the business. In terms of -- on the natural gas side, what we're seeing there is very similar to what I said in a comment that I had just made. With natural gas we're seeing, with those the Shell oil wells starting to shut in and starting to slow production, you are seeing what was a massive glut of natural gas across the U.S. that depressed prices, and really had no volatility in the natural gas market, all of a sudden introduced some real volatility. And I know from talking with a lot of our commercial customers there. They're looking at trading more than ever, further out the curve, longer dated type positions. The natural gas basis markets continuing to grow and grow nicely in open interest terms. And the complimentary to trading in the basis markets is oftentimes people trade that as a spread to Henry, and trade them in a longer dated way. And historically, that has been the area of the market that we've played in. And that's why we're seeing the growth that we have, the robust growth that we have in Henry as well as basis.\nJeff Sprecher: Ken, this is Jeff. One comment that I think you'll appreciate is, in Europe, you have the EMIR legislation, which is similar in scope to what the United States adopted after the financial crisis in our Dodd-Frank legislation. As you may know those U.S. and European legislators wanted more strength over the counter markets and move and push many market participants more towards clearing of swaps and derivatives positions. In Europe, there was a carve out that the utility business, if you will, and utilities did not have to clear OTC positions, they didn't have to margin each other. And so, to a certain degree, when Ben says the over the counter market is active in Europe, it's partly, because the futures market has to really earn its way, the trust of the market, because people do have to post margin in the futures business. So, for many, it can be more expensive. The reality is your counterparty is the clearinghouse which has a lot of transparency and safeguards around it regulatory oversight, as opposed to bilateral deals where you have less knowledge potentially of your counterparty. In times of stress like this, people pay attention to their counterparties. And so we again see this as another opportunity. We saw a similar kind of outcome after Enron's collapse, after the financial crisis collapse in 2008, 2009. And I suspect that you will us working hard to convince customers that we're a better -- European customers that we're a better place for them to keep their positions. So, there is opportunity always in times of change.\nOperator: Our next question is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to chat about your credit business for a second. So, I saw a couple days ago, you guys launched ICE-Select to consolidate access to a variety of liquidity platforms, obviously you guys purchased over the years. Can you talk a little bit about how that integration process is going? How are you guys marketing that to clients? Maybe give us an updated sense of what sort of the credit trading revenue for that whole business looks like. And whether or not this is a this is a point in time for ICE where we could see a more material acceleration and credit trading revenue? Thanks.\nBen Jackson: Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. On the latter point around revenue, I think the way to think about our platforms and I've said this on our earnings call a couple of calls ago, is that the performance in terms of revenue that you'll see will be still very similar to what you'd see in the ATS volumes, that are reported from the consolidated tapes, less than 250, because the execution venues historically have been retail oriented. And where we've been focused is on building out our network and getting established, and getting as many touch points as we can into the institutional trading space to really start to penetrate that market. So, let me let me hit the first part of your question then. Our strategy has been to help industry participants, solve real strains in that secondary market, secondary trading market of just sourcing liquidity for bonds. It's been very difficult, especially in times of stress, and we saw this in the last couple of months to procure bonds, individual bonds, because it's still mostly analog, still a lot done heavily over the phone. So, our strategy has been to pull together our pricing or analytics capabilities and our execution technologies to create new innovations. And the first innovation, which we've talked about many times on this call is ETF Hub. And Jeff gave some statistics in his in his commentary. But we launched that platform with equities in the beginning of Q4 last year, fixed income in late Q4. And we've already had in a short period of time $200 billion in notional trade on that platform. In March alone, that accelerated to $87 billion. And out of that $87 billion, $63 billion of it was fixed income. When you think about $63 billion in fixed income in a month, in primary trading, that's a pretty good starting place of the market that trades electronically and on the phone. In the secondary market, where people are going to procure the bonds to gather the basket, and then they go to our primary trading offering to go ahead and swap that basket for a particular ETF share. So, we're seeing nice growth in the primary trading space. Jeff also mentioned that we have a new innovation that it just came out, with the ability to customize the basket of securities that are swapped for an ETF share. We believe this is important fundamental building block for us to further grow our community of APs and issuers that are on the platform. In parallel to that, so you saw the announcement yesterday that you referenced. So, we're very happy that with the announcement we were able to make yesterday, because what that in fact is, it's for the first time we've pulled together all of the liquidity on our various venues. So, acquisitions like TMC, BondPoint, and Creditex, we pull all that liquidity into one easy to use portal for customers to access. We've also combined the multiple protocols that we have. So everything from RFQ to auctions to click to trade, all into one interface. And last but not least, we've added on our institutional analytics as part of our data services business that serves the vast majority of the institutional investment community, with tools like best execution, and our real time pricing service called CEP. So now our customer can access in one portal a deep set of liquidity. You have choice of all of these different protocols. And you have institutional analytics to tell you what's the quality of my execution that I would get in these electronic liquidity pools. So where this starts to come together now, what our vision has been is that, between the primary trading order flow, so that $63 billion that I had mentioned, that we did in March, and our fully integrated businesses across ICE Data Services, as well as our ICE Bonds businesses through the ICE-Select portal that we announced yesterday, that now positions us for the first time to really compete for institutional flow that has traditionally done either in electronic form or still predominantly way over the phone for the first time. And because we're now in that position in the second-half of this year is when we're going to start publishing for all of you relevant metrics, the development of our network on the hub, as well as the development of our execution venues as they continue to mature.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back to Jeff Sprecher for closing remarks.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Kate. Well, we look forward to speaking to you about the company's current quarter on our next call. And I hope that in the meantime, that you and your loved one stay safe and stay very positive about the opportunities that lie ahead for all of us. And with that, I hope you have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ben Jackson",
            "content": "Sure, I can add a little more to that. And thanks for the question Rich. So, Jeff hit it very well around one of the core differences between the two contracts as one's global in nature, one's very local and landlocked. With WTI as Jeff said, there's well-publicized structural issues at Cushing. Infrastructure issues have happened in the past with pipeline and storage issues that create volatility in delivery. And as Jeff also said, the major difference between that and Brent is the Brent of waterborne contract, where it's much easier to low crude on the vessel and bring it anywhere in the world where there's demand and the economics makes sense. So you'll see a huge demand pool that you're servicing with the Brent contract, and you don't have those fundamental landlocked structural constraints on the contracts. The other difference has not talked about as much, and Jeff touched on this briefly, is that WTI is a spot month contract. It expires right when the delivery schedules at Cushing are being set. For example, the June contract expires on May 19, with only a couple days left of scheduling to happen on the Cushing infrastructure for deliveries. For the Brent contract, it's much more of a forward contract. So if you take that example of the June contract as well, that contract expires a full month before. And actually today is the expiration day of the Brent, June contract. So the full month between that and the contract is much less susceptible to issues that you'd see that can happen around infrastructure related issues or constraints that you'd see in a landlocked contract like WTI. The other big difference to just highlight quickly Rich is, because there was some misinformation put out there recently, around the concept of Dated Brent. And we give customers, yes, we give customers the choice of Dated Brent versus Brent to hedge. Dated Brent is a true spot month contract. So that price has cargoes all the way going up to the delivery month. Dated Brent versus Brent are two very different contracts, and there's a spread relationship that develops between those two contracts that does trade because they are very different. Dated Brent are spot contract. In that contract, we see that 85% of the open interest in that contract are professional, large commercials that are all over the delivery process that's happening in crude oil. So it's a heavily, heavily commercially oriented contract. And Brent, Dated Brent trade as a spread to one another just like WTI front month to WTI second month trade as a spread to one another. But I can say that Dated Brent, the Brent never blew out anywhere near to the degree that WTI did in the past week, where the spread between WTI front month to back month went from $58 to $59, and at that same period Dated Brent to Brent was around $5. It's these recent and past moves in WTI versus Brent, that have shown that WTI can be a riskier contract to risk manage. And that's why customers overwhelmingly select Brent to manage their risk. They also select Brent as really the basis and pricing mechanism to price all kinds of refined products, that we talk about oftentimes is one of the fastest growth areas of our business, which is our other oil complex. So these are refined products like gas oil, bunker fuels, jet fuels, gasoline, they all trade relative to Brent and they all trade in a global nature in areas around the world such as Europe, Asia, and North America and it's one of the fastest growing parts of our complex. This is why, if you look at the overall oil complex, our market share and overall oil from an open interest perspective is 64%, up from 55% just a couple of years ago. And in ADV terms, our market share is 56%, up from 45% in recent past. We're grateful that our customers are coming to us now more than ever to help manage their risk in this turbulent time. Yes. It's a good question, Alex. Thank you. Let me start with what I don't know. I don't know exactly, when the world goes back to work, whether that's second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter, early 2021. I don't think it'd be useful for you. I don't have an economist on staff to tell you that it could be fast or slow or anywhere in between. So, I don't have great visibility into exactly when things open up. But I have a lot of visibility into fact that give me confidence. So one of the things, I've got confidence based upon is I look at the pipeline and talk to Lynn and her sales team. And the pipeline remains really robust. And so the opportunity exists to sell into that pipeline and to generate revenue, that as we sit here today, we believe are consistent with the original data guide that we provided. I look at ASV that's up 4%. And if you do just the straight math on that ASV number, it lands you right on top of where we're guiding in the second quarter, and I think provides a firm foundation as we move into the third and fourth quarter. I listened to Lynn and our team talk about phone calls we got in the middle of the crisis from customers. We're thinking about or had moved away to one of the other competitors, and realized that the tracking error on the prices from those peers were significantly greater than the tracking error on our prices that are coming back to us. I know we were able to close a couple of key deals, but those deals didn't sign due to the work from home, which is not a loss revenue, it's just a delay, which I think can also help us in the back-half of the year. So in the very near-term, I see a lot of positives that give me confidence as we move into the back-half of the year. I think more importantly, the key thing, key message I'd like to get across is there's nothing that's happened in the last month or two or three that changed the medium to long-term prospects of this business, and our ability to generate 4% to 6% revenue growth. So, no matter what happens in the third or fourth quarter or early in the next year, this business is set up to grow well, for exactly the reason that you indicated. It is a business that provides mission critical information into the fixed income market. In fact, I've heard a number of our customers say, during the crisis price discovery in fixed income came from us. And I think that's going to be even more important as we get to the other side of this crisis. I think the demand for fixed income investment will continue to grow. I think the evolution of indices and ETFs will continue to generate demand on prices. And we're going to be there to serve it. And then the last data point that I would give you, that gives me confidence is we look back after 2000 and 2001, the IDC business grew greater than 4%. We look back after 2008, 2009, the IDC business grew greater than 4%. And that was when it was just prices. Today, its prices and reference data in fixed income and a strong network. And by the way, it's supplemented by a futures exchange business that between 2009 and 2012 also grew high-single digits coming out of the financial crisis. So, in the near-term, it's hard to call what exactly the numbers are going to be in the back-half, but I'd keep that in perspective as well. Because, even to the extent we're off a little bit we're talking about $0.02 to $0.03 a share on earnings well above $4, so it's something less than a 0.5% of earnings in the near-term. And a long-term model still positioned very well to grow 4% to 6%. Thanks, Dan. This is Ben again. So on the latter part of your question there around WTI being seaborne, the reality is when you look in the physical market, when those barrels and when that oil hits the water, it's most often priced by a Brent, that's when it becomes Brent. So that's one of the major differences and it doesn't stop or prevent any of the issues that you see around, the infrastructure related issues around storage or pipeline capacity to get oil actually to the coast. So that's one. On the customer base itself, couple of quick comments on that. So on every earnings call, you've either heard Jeff, Scott or myself for many, many years, talk about that, since the inception of our futures business, we've really had the corporate commercial customer at the heart of our business. Those are customers that have real directional price risk. And whatever commodity is they're consuming or that they're producing in the physical markets. And what the futures markets are intended to do for them, as all of you know, is to hedge that risk if prices move against them, and to protect them in turbulent times. And we partnered with our customers very differently than others have and built out this suite. As Jeff mentioned in his prepared comments, hundreds and hundreds of oil products around the world. We have many, many different natural gas products around the world, power contracts around the world that help our customers hedge. So, we're grateful. What we can say right now is that we're grateful that our customers are coming to us now more than ever. The evidence is showing to help them manage their risk in these turbulent times. We saw open interest records in March. Open interest is the best sign of customers coming to you and showing that they're putting on positions for a period of time to manage their risks. In April, we've seen it grow on a year-over-year basis as well. We're seeing open interest across natural gas, across oil, continuing to build in longer dated positions, which basically means positions that aren't for necessarily expiry next month, but positions that are going expire in December of this year or 2021 or 2022. And people that are tend to put on those longer dated positions are commercials that are in fact hedging their exposure to price risk. Commercials represent about 44% of the open interest in contracts like Brent. Also our Henry Hub contract's more than double our closest peer in their benchmark products that they have. The only thing I'd say is if you look at other evidence point I'd look at, is if you look at past times of stress, so you look at times when 09/11 happened, when the financial crisis hit, when Shell oil came exploding onto the scene. Brent ADV grew every single time in the 12 month period after that crisis hit, compared to the 12 month period prior to that crisis and open interest either held or grew. Now all that said, we're mindful that every day there's real stress in the marketplace that our customers are feeling. And the fact that they're coming to us more than ever to hedge their exposure to price risk in these volatile times is what our markets were fundamentally built for. And we're going to continue to partner and help our customers through this. So Michael, you were a little bit unclear in the question. I think what you were asking, the latter part was on capital return, which I'll touch on, and on the former part with expense management in the challenging environment. That's the question I'm going to answer. Hopefully, it's right. So, first of all, the way we're thinking about expense is it's consistent in terms of where we thought coming into the year. And the reason for that is we think it's really important to continue to invest in our business as we move through 2020. And the strong performance across our business allows us to continue to do that. It's important that we continue to invest in ETF hub.  Jeff talked about some of the milestones that we hit in that, it's important to continue to invest in building out our mortgage solutions. That's a business that when we bought it was $140 million revenue stream that now is on track to be $170 million plus. And you, I'm sure read the articles about the need for that business to automate beyond where it is today. So, we're going to continue to invest in that. We're going to continue to invest in the data sales team. We talked about growth in the European sales team and challenges in the fourth quarter. That business in Europe went from a decline in the fourth quarter to growth in the first quarter. And we continue to invest in the sales team, because when customers are ready to start taking the meetings, or as Jeff alluded to, if they want to do deals over the phone, we want to make sure that we've invested in the sales team that's necessary to deliver on that. And so our expense guidance is consistent, because we believe that this business is well-positioned to continue to grow this year and beyond. And it's important that we continue to feed the growth engine with the investments on the expense side. Now, having said that, you'll note that in our original guidance, we had $15 million to $25 million of expense efficiencies that we were counting on, and we will certainly deliver those. We absolutely do have flexibility if things get significantly worse as we move through the year. For a long time, a big part of our compensation system is paid for performance. And so to extent that the business performance starts to slow, we've got a natural break that happens on comp expense, which is half of our overall expense. But as we sit here today, Jeff alluded to, our employees did a phenomenally good job from home, delivering the markets, the risk management tools that our customers needed. And again, we're very confident in the future of this business and don't want to cut off the investments that are necessary to generate future growth. In terms of capital return, you know, we mentioned in the quarter that we spent -- our dividend grew 9% in the first quarter. We just announced our second quarter dividend, it's similar growth. That's a dividend that's grown double digits every year since we announced it back in 2013. And in addition to kind of what I'll call the run rate $400 million of buyback, we spent $300 million in addition. And I will tell you that the $300 million was spent in our open window in largely around the disconnect that happened around the eBay leak, earlier in the quarter, where once again, we felt like the market had completely mispriced our company. And we felt it was appropriate to opportunistically repurchase shares. That window ended before the COVID crisis really hit. But as we said, we bought it about $92 a share and those shares sit around $92. As we move forward, I think you should continue to expect us to return 100% of the capital that we don't need for M&A, that extra $300 million we spent in the first quarter. We still were at our leverage target. We'll obviously continue to monitor that as we move through the year. But given the strength of our cash flows, I would anticipate you'll see our routine 400 a quarter of share buybacks continue. You'll see the dividends continue at its current levels, which is growing year-over-year. And our overall approach is not different to capital returns. Last point, I'd make on capital, because I think it's important to note that within the first quarter, not only did we spend an extra $300 million on buyback, we also spent nearly $300 million helping back to acquire Bridge2 Solution, and yet our leverage was still at 2.3 times, which is a complete testament to the strength of the cash flows of this business. And on the second part -- let me get the second part of the question that Brian had asked around mix. So in the comments that I made on the past couple of questions, I dropped in a couple of statistics there. But I think the key thing there to really frame your mind is that we are heavily commercially oriented, much more so than our closest peer. Both Brent, as well as our Henry Hub are two perfect examples. We're about 44% of the open interest is commercials. And when you do that same analysis WTI and Henry Hub at one of our peers, you're going to see that that's more than double what they have. So it's heavily commercially oriented. It's the commercial traders that we cater to and have really built our markets around. The second biggest segment of the marketplace would be swap dealers, banks that are selling structured products too and commercials. So you'll see that that is a lot of the trading activity and hedging activity that we see. I think one other interesting data point for you it's just Henry Hub alone. So, for one of the things that we've seen is with Shell oil production coming down in the U.S., well, oftentimes when Shell oil is being drilled, a byproduct of that is natural gas coming out of the ground in the U.S. And producers, you know, customers have acknowledged and seen that like gas production is starting to slow, and it's introduced some volatility into the basis markets in the U.S. But what we've seen is that customers are coming, very significantly to our basis markets as much as they ever have, where they manage 100% of their risk in the basis markets that we manage. And then secondly, they oftentimes trade not only the basis markets, but they put on longer dated Henry Hub positions, which is much more the longer dated positions, longer expiries is much more where the commercials play and manage their risk. And that has historically, since the inception of the company and starting our Henry Hub contract has been the part of the market that we have service. Because of those trends, we've seen Henry Hub market share in open interest terms added 10 year high right now, with 46% market share in Henry Hub. So, we're seeing customers more than ever come to manage their exposure to price risk in our markets, which is what futures markets were built for. Sure. Thanks, Ken. This is Ben again. So one of the things we've been watching is with this pandemic, will that impact people's transition, and in particular in Europe and Asia to cleaner fuels and will that slow it down. And what we've seen is that it hasn't. I mean, as we've engaged with all of our commercials and commercial customers, and also the fact that the price of natural gas and LNG for example is low. We're seeing that transition to cleaner fuels is still really invoke in Europe and in Asia. And that's what led to the growth that you just referenced in TTF. And we continue to see tremendous growth in our JKM contract. There still is a decent amount of that market that trades in the OTC space. So there's a lot of runway to go still and bringing more of that business to futures. And more and more customers each month, as we look at the volume that's trading the OTC market versus futures. Customers are continuing to see the benefit of trading in the futures markets. And we're seeing that continue to shift and move more and more towards the future side of the business. In terms of -- on the natural gas side, what we're seeing there is very similar to what I said in a comment that I had just made. With natural gas we're seeing, with those the Shell oil wells starting to shut in and starting to slow production, you are seeing what was a massive glut of natural gas across the U.S. that depressed prices, and really had no volatility in the natural gas market, all of a sudden introduced some real volatility. And I know from talking with a lot of our commercial customers there. They're looking at trading more than ever, further out the curve, longer dated type positions. The natural gas basis markets continuing to grow and grow nicely in open interest terms. And the complimentary to trading in the basis markets is oftentimes people trade that as a spread to Henry, and trade them in a longer dated way. And historically, that has been the area of the market that we've played in. And that's why we're seeing the growth that we have, the robust growth that we have in Henry as well as basis. Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. On the latter point around revenue, I think the way to think about our platforms and I've said this on our earnings call a couple of calls ago, is that the performance in terms of revenue that you'll see will be still very similar to what you'd see in the ATS volumes, that are reported from the consolidated tapes, less than 250, because the execution venues historically have been retail oriented.

            "name": "Jeff Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Scott, and good morning to everyone, on the call. Before I begin my remarks on Slide 7, I want to express our sincere hope that you and your families are safe and healthy. I'd also like to take a moment to thank my colleagues at ICE for the resilience and the dedication that they've exhibited over the last few months, and importantly, thank our customers, who now more than ever, put their trust in our people and our technology to manage their risk across asset classes around the world. Business continuity planning has always been paramount at ICE. Being prepared for managing risk is our business, and it's in our DNA. A number of years ago, we started building large scale remote capacity with a robust cyber overlay, so that our employees could work from home for extended periods of time. This meant equipping them with portable technologies, building secure virtual desktop environments, and being prepared to supply important equipment out of our own inventory. Sure, happy to Rich. Well, first of all, WTI, West Texas Intermediate crude oil, as many of you know as crude oil delivered in pipelines at Cushing, Oklahoma on a specific day, and there's local storage there. When there are pipeline problems or storage problems or problems on a specific day, that particular price discovery can reflect those problems. And that's what people believe have happened with the negative pricing at WTI earlier this month. But, I will say that we are aware that there are investigations going on to satisfy the market, the price discovery that happened on that day at that moment and that place, is truly representative. So, we look forward to the outcome of that. Brent is slightly different, and I'll explain a little bit at a high-level and then maybe ask Ben Jackson to help me augment some of the details. But there's a lot more cushion, if you will, built into the way Brent operates. First of all, it's a global contract. And so it's really looking at global capacity, global shipping capacity, global port capacity, global storage capacity, because the oil is seaborne. And as you know, I think Rich, it is a cash settled contract that settles against an index, that is an index that ICE generates itself by looking at what is considered the physical market called the Dated Brent market. And, we look at cargoes that are exchanged hands between major oil companies, these tend to be trades of a full cargo, ship cargo or a half a ship cargo that trade around the world, as the oil companies are trying to manage the delivery out of Deepwater Derrick, shipping availability, port availability and storage around the world. Those cargoes are traded to keep that whole physical infrastructure in check and balance. And those are the cargoes that we look at and create an index. If there are anomalies in trading, we have the right to question those anomalies and either ask for more information or disregard them or adjust them. So, there's human judgment that goes into that. And lastly, the Brent index, the Brent crude oil contract, the futures contract that we trade does not deliver on a day. It is a forward looking delivery period that has more cushion in it than we have at West Texas Intermediate crude oil. So, once long short, it's more global, it's more diversified, has more buffer and has human judgment in it, all of which can help alleviate some of the near-term stress that happens compared to WTI, where you have a moment in time and local infrastructure. In my mind, Richards, why WTI has always been a more speculative trader oriented contract, because people like to try to figure out those local issues and trade around them, and people with good judgment and good information can speculate around what's going on locally. Brent is a more global and more commercially used contract, because it's more closely reflects what's happening around the world. Ben, do you have anything that you'd like to augment? Alex, this is Jeff. I'll give you one interesting -- interesting to me, at least, anecdotal piece of information that surprised me. And that was that our sales people in data have targets and budgets, as you can imagine. And our people in Asia were hit with work from home very early in the quarter, a lot of dislocation in our customer base in Asia. And yet we could see they were meeting or exceeding their sales targets. And so while, the sales call itself became very, very difficult on our people, the demand became very, very strong. And between that dislocation, our sales people and our customers figured out how to do business with one another and get things done. So we very early in the quarter felt pretty good about where we were heading before the lockdowns hit Europe and the U.S. And so I feel somewhat confident that our entire market is figuring out how to adjust to this -- I'll call it new normal of working from home. Yes. I got it. This is Jeff. On data what we're seeing is, the sale of the NYSE, U.S. equities tape is a very mature business, and not so much that there's pricing pressure. There's just consolidation I think in the way, at least, historically before this crisis, there had been ongoing consolidation in asset managers. And that really wasn't as much price as it was number of customers. But the rest of our business, we're seeing this huge demand and has really no price pressure on it, in the sense that there's a rotation away from desktop terminals, fixed terminals. As you can imagine, when you work from home, people are looking for lightweight, portable, easy to access, secure information and that's really a technology delivery issue that we are very good at, because of our investment in technology, because we're prepared to give you information in any form you want it, we've been able to move quickly to fill kind of this new need. I think we're demonstrating to a lot of people that, because we had so much capacity in our systems that on these extremely volatile days, our data was able to keep up and our analytics were able to deliver results, where we heard anecdotally that a number of our competitors that may have had lower prices or people that had moved to them for other reasons, wish that they hadn't done that. And we saw people come back to reengage with us, which was a very warming feeling for our sales teams. So, long story short, no, not a lot of price pressure. Much more about can I get the right information at the right place at the right time, and can I rely on it? And, that's what we're good at. Ken, this is Jeff. One comment that I think you'll appreciate is, in Europe, you have the EMIR legislation, which is similar in scope to what the United States adopted after the financial crisis in our Dodd-Frank legislation. As you may know those U.S. and European legislators wanted more strength over the counter markets and move and push many market participants more towards clearing of swaps and derivatives positions. In Europe, there was a carve out that the utility business, if you will, and utilities did not have to clear OTC positions, they didn't have to margin each other. And so, to a certain degree, when Ben says the over the counter market is active in Europe, it's partly, because the futures market has to really earn its way, the trust of the market, because people do have to post margin in the futures business. So, for many, it can be more expensive. The reality is your counterparty is the clearinghouse which has a lot of transparency and safeguards around it regulatory oversight, as opposed to bilateral deals where you have less knowledge potentially of your counterparty. In times of stress like this, people pay attention to their counterparties. And so we again see this as another opportunity. We saw a similar kind of outcome after Enron's collapse, after the financial crisis collapse in 2008, 2009. And I suspect that you will us working hard to convince customers that we're a better -- European customers that we're a better place for them to keep their positions. So, there is opportunity always in times of change. Thank you, Kate. Well, we look forward to speaking to you about the company's current quarter on our next call. And I hope that in the meantime, that you and your loved one stay safe and stay very positive about the opportunities that lie ahead for all of us. And with that, I hope you have a great day."

Before we begin, we want to offer our hope that you your colleagues and your families are staying safe and remain healthy, during this unprecedented time. I'll begin this morning on Slide 4, with some of the key highlights from our record first quarter results. First Quarter net revenues totaled $1.6 billion up 23% year-over-year, driven by record trading and clearing revenues of $883 million and record data services revenues of $564 million. It's worth noting that this quarter started with January yielding what at the time was the best revenue month in our history. That record was nearly equal during February. While growing uncertainty related to COVID further increased our customers demand for price discovery and risk management in March. It is our customer focus and our investments in both sales resources and product innovation that generated the high-retention rate and growth in open interest, which lays the foundation for our record performance even prior to March, and which supports our ability to continue to grow once the impacts of COVID subside. Right. And just before Ben picks up on that question, the only other thing I would add, as I mentioned earlier is, we're not just selling prices anymore. Now with customers that need the prices and the reference data and indices, and as Jeff alluded to, the connectivity. It's a full sale solution that we have. And so, it tends not to be as much about the price of any one element, but how well we can bundle that package together to meet their needs."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mary Caroline O\u2019Neal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMary Caroline O\u2019Neal: Good morning. ICE\u2019s fourth quarter 2021 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2021 Form 10-K and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You\u2019ll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses, and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE and Chair of Fixed Income and Data Services. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks, MC. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.34, up 17% year-over-year, marking the best quarter in our company\u2019s history. Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion and increased 10% versus last year. Total transaction revenues grew 11%, while total recurring revenues, which account for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $749 million, slightly higher than expected, driven by additional severance as well as higher performance-based compensation due to the strong results to finish the year. Adjusted operating income increased by 14%, totaling a record $1.1 billion. This strong operating performance contributed to a record full year free cash flow of over $2.8 billion, of which we returned $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, while also reducing our gross leverage to 3x EBITDA, nearly a full year ahead of schedule. Now let\u2019s move to Slide 5, where I\u2019ll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled $1 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 71% increase in our interest rate business and a 29% increase in our energy revenues, both driven in part by rising inflation expectations. Revenues within our global oil complex increased 29% year-over-year, while natural gas and environmental products, which represent approximately 40% of our energy revenues, increased by 36% in the quarter and were up 20% for the full year. Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business, increased by 8% year-over-year, including 10% growth in listings. Turning now to Slide 6. I\u2019ll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $480 million, a 7% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 7% in the quarter. Within recurring revenues, our fixed income, data and analytics business increased by 6% year-over-year, including another quarter of double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 7% driven by continued demand for our ICE Global Network and consolidated fees offering. For the full year, data services revenue increased by 6%. And importantly, annual subscription value, or ASV, enters the first quarter up 5.5%, setting us up for yet another strong year of compounding revenue growth. Let\u2019s go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Fourth quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $346 million. Recurring revenues, which accounted for over 40% of segment revenues, totaled $149 million and grew 26% year-over-year. While total Mortgage Technology revenues declined slightly, down 1% in the fourth quarter, we outperformed an industry that experienced a roughly 30% decline in origination volumes. For the full year, Mortgage Technology revenues grew 17% on a pro forma basis, reaching $1.4 billion well ahead of our initial expectations and on track to achieve our target of more than doubling revenues over a 10-year period. I\u2019ll conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with some additional guidance. We expect full year total recurring revenues to be between $3.68 billion and $3.75 billion. This includes approximately $30 million of headwinds related to FX, the planned phase-out of sterling LIBOR and Euronext post-Brexit decision to migrate certain connectivity services away from our UK data center and on to the continent. It is worth noting that the majority of Euronext connectivity revenues are expected to be offset by a related reduction in costs. Adjusting for these items, we expect core growth in our recurring revenues, which again account for half of our business, to be approximately 6% to 8% for the full year. This strong growth, which is on top of 10% growth last year, is expected to once again be led by our Mortgage Technology business, which we expect will grow in the low to mid-teens and importantly, is on top of an exceptional 30% growth in 2021. In addition, and supported by an ASV that exits the fourth quarter up 5.5%, we anticipate another year of 5% to 6% growth in our Fixed Income and Data Services recurring revenues. Moving to expenses. We expect 2022 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.99 billion to $3.04 billion. Consistent with prior years, we will reward our employees for their contributions to our strong results and therefore, expect compensation expense, net of synergies and the resetting of 2021 performance awards, to increase by $25 million to $35 million. Expenses tied to revenues are also expected to increase by $25 million to $35 million driven by higher license fees as well as investments in business and product development across all three of our segments. In addition, we expect an incremental $40 million to $60 million in support of productivity and efficiency initiatives across our technology and operations groups, a portion of which we are electing to fund through the net operating savings we realized following the IPO of Bakkt. Lastly, and similar to last year, we expect roughly $30 million of incremental D&A expense related to purchase accounting and the rebuild of Ellie Mae CapEx. Please see Slide 12 in the appendix for a bridge reconciling our expense guidance to 2021. Moving next to capital allocation and consistent with our track record of growing our dividend as we grow, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend by 15% year-over-year from $0.33 per share to $0.38 per share. In addition, and now that we are within our targeted leverage range, we expect to deploy approximately $475 million towards share repurchases in the first quarter, representing a nearly 20% increase versus the second quarter of 2020, the last full quarter of buybacks prior to our acquisition of Ellie Mae. In summary, we delivered a record finish to another record year. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also invested in an array of future growth initiatives, increased our dividend double digits and achieved our leverage target a year earlier than originally planned. As we kick off 2022, we\u2019re focused on, once again, delivering growth and creating shareholder value against what is an ever evolving macro backdrop. I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I\u2019ll hand it over to Ben.\nBen Jackson: Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. We are pleased to report another record year for ICE. Our strong financial results reflect the tremendous efforts of my colleagues across the organization, the trust and expanding relationship we have with our customers and the ability of our business model to drive growth across a variety of macroeconomic environments. I\u2019d like to focus on the secular trends that are driving growth across our mortgage and energy markets. And we\u2019ll turn it over to Lynn to discuss our position across fixed income, data and analytics and some highlights from our great year at the NYSE. Our data, technology and network expertise position us well to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening across the mortgage industry. As mortgage origination costs continue to increase, electronification is a trend we believe will continue in a variety of interest rate environments and regardless of mortgage origination volumes. Our ability to capture this secular trend is evidenced by the strength and resiliency of our recurring revenues. Part of that growth is driven by our strategy to intentionally shift more business to recurring revenue. We also continue to see strong sales and new customers coming on to the platform. And with connectivity to nearly every participant in the mortgage industry, we have the opportunity to cross-sell new products like eClose and AIQ to a captive customer base seeking efficiencies. This flywheel effect and the secular trend of electronification give us confidence in our ability to grow this business and capture the $10 billion addressable market. Across our energy markets, we achieved record volumes in 2021, including in Brent, TTF and environmentals. The breadth and depth of our platform not only drove strong volumes and revenues, but more importantly, it positions us to capture secular tailwinds across our energy complex, including the globalization of natural gas in the clean energy transition. We have built a global natural gas business, including our European marker, TTF. The globalization of natural gas and the rise of LNG have driven TTF to emerge as the global gas benchmark. And in 2021, record volumes on our platform grew 45% and drove revenue growth of 36%. Our markets continue to be relied on by an increasing number of participants to manage risk and navigate volatile gas and power markets. We were also early to diversify into environmentals, acquiring the Climate Exchange in 2010 and building around those leading markets to develop a global environmental business. And in 2021, we reached record volumes across the complex, including in our EU, UK renewable greenhouse gas initiatives and California carbon allowances. These record volumes contributed to a 56% increase in environmental revenues versus the prior year. As customers navigate the uncertainty and volatility related to the clean energy transition, we are well positioned as the venue of choice to manage risk and provide price transparency across the energy spectrum. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Lynn.\nLynn Martin: Thank you, Ben. With data and technology at our core, our goal is to provide solutions which add transparency to both commonly understood risks as well as emerging risks such as ESG. We continue to increase the breadth and coverage of our products and accelerate the delivery of our ESG reference data to the NYSE issuer community, providing non-opinion-based insights to market participants. And in the fourth quarter, we expanded our climate change and alternative data capabilities with the acquisition of risQ and Level 11 Analytics. Combining geospatial data technology with our financial data will bring greater transparency to ESG risks across the financial markets, including our existing muni bond and mortgage-backed security offering. Our data, technology and leading marketplaces position us well to benefit from the secular trend towards sustainability and net zero carbon commitments. Turning now to fixed income. Increased automation, flexibility of delivery and passive investing continue to drive demand for our proprietary data and rapidly growing index business. As a leading data provider to the fixed income market, we are uniquely positioned to drive automation. Leveraging our proprietary evaluated prices, analytics and our growing suite of reference data, we\u2019ve taken a business that historically served the back and middle office and created tools and analytics for the front office. These tools are critical to the pre-trade transparency needed in the opaque, less liquid fixed income markets as is evidenced by our front-office tools continuing to grow double-digits. The growth in passive investing continues to be a tailwind for our business. The flexibility of our tools, quality of our pricing data and flexibility of our offering directly contributed to the five asset managers with funds of over $66 billion of AUM that transitioned to ICE indices during 2021 and an additional group of funds with AUM of $6.7 billion have planned transitions during Q1 2022. This strength drove double-digit revenue growth in our index business for the fourth consecutive year and positions us well for continued growth. I\u2019ll close with some highlights from the NYSE. 2021 was a record year for NYSE listings. We help connect innovators and entrepreneurs to nearly $120 billion in capital through 297 IPOs, including three of the four largest IPOs and the three largest tech IPOs. And importantly, we continue to lead the market in ETF listings with more than 65% of new funds selecting us as their home. We also continue to prioritize our market-leading technology, which enables customers to better manage risk and provide our issuer community with significantly less volatility at the open and the close. The performance of our technology was proven as recently as last week when we processed nearly 0.5 trillion messages in a single day with median response times of less than 30 microseconds across our equities complex, further cementing our position as the leading equity exchange group. Our leading data and technology coupled with our investments in sustainable finance, the secular trends across fixed income markets and the competitive differentiators of the NYSE will continue to drive our growth well into the future. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Lynn, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn now to Slide 10. 2021 marked our 16th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings per share. This track record of growth reflects our strategy to diversify the business and position the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion, a strategy that has made ICE an all-weather name, a business model that provides upside to volatility with less downside risk and importantly, a positioning that drives growth on top of growth. We have intentionally diversified across asset classes so that we are not tied to any one cyclical trend or one macroeconomic environment. For example, in 2021, we saw record volumes across our energy complex driven in part by inflationary concerns and market speculation of central bank activity. Our European and UK interest rate business also benefited from interest rate volatility, driving a 15% increase in revenues in 2021 and more recently, a 34% increase in our January revenues. Our CDS clearing business grew 14% in the fourth quarter as rate volatility increased, driving demand for risk management and credit protection. And even against this backdrop of rising interest rates, our Mortgage Technology business outperformed the broader market, including pro forma recurring revenue growth in 2021, up 31%, again, a reflection of the all-weather nature of our business model. As we begin 2022, we are better positioned than ever to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes. And we remain focused on investing and executing on the many growth opportunities in front of us. Before we end our prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in 2021, and I\u2019d like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their continued efforts. Your hard work contributed to the best quarter in our company\u2019s history combined with other excellent results, making it the best year in our company\u2019s history. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Andrew, our operator, to conduct the question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time.\nOperator: Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Good morning, guys. Good morning, Jeff. So my question is on the recurring revenue growth for mortgage. It was up 31%, and now you\u2019re guiding to, I think, low-double digits. Could you give us more color on that? Is that just the large numbers? Any progress on metrics to sort of \u2013 that we can monitor that recurring revenue in mortgage? And then lastly, Jeff, I know you talked about the offset, but how do you think about the offset going forward? Is it simply interest rate futures offsetting what looks like a slowdown in origination volumes going forward?\nBen Jackson: Hi Rich, it\u2019s Ben. I\u2019ll start here. So the \u2013 you hit on it a bit in the way you answered the question. So you do have growth compounding on top of growth there in the subscription side of the business. But also, I mean, we are looking at macro headwinds. I mean, Warren brought up in his commentary that if you take a composite of where the industry analysts have volumes that you have volumes down 30%. And in that environment, we could see some macro headwinds such as are there going to be a bunch of brand-new originators coming on to the scene? Potentially not. Could you see some industry consolidation? Potentially, we\u2019ll see some of that. But despite those types of headwinds, we see an opportunity to grow this subscription business in the teens because we have great visibility to a phenomenal new business pipeline of new customers that we\u2019re looking at right now. We have the ability to cross-sell to that large stable of customers that we have solutions like our AIQ business, that will provide them more efficiency as well as our industry-leading point-of-sale solutions. And then the other dynamic that we have going on is that move towards subscription as customers renew. We had a pilot program last year where we have roughly 20% of our customers renew in a given year. With a small percentage of those that renewed last year, we looked at shifting them more towards subscription. We\u2019re successful doing that. And we\u2019ve codified a program of this year to hit a much larger percentage of the roughly 20% that are renewing this year. So all of those, we believe, are tailwinds to offset the macroeconomic environments there and will lead to a teens grower in subscription revenue, which we feel great about.\nJeff Sprecher: And Rich, this is Jeff. Yes, we\u2019ve really thought hard over the last few years on how to position the company to be an all-weather name that will just grow on top of growth and in all macro environments and global geographies. And so our thinking is that inflationary pressures are what drive central banks to raise interest rates. And we have a lot of asset classes that we participate in and positioning of the company that will benefit from that volatility. And we tend to see commodity businesses like energy and agricultural commodities be very volatile in inflationary environments. And therefore, there\u2019s a lot of hedging, and we help people manage that risk. Similarly, obviously, in our interest rate businesses, which include interest rate futures and credit default swaps and fixed income data and services in a volatile interest rate environment, those businesses do well. And even in the mortgage space, as Ben has been talking about, home inflation tends to drive people to do cash-out refinancings, which for us, refinancing a house versus buying a new house is the same transaction to our mortgage platform. So we really feel like we\u2019ve positioned the company well in this environment. We also feel like we positioned the company well if there isn\u2019t inflation, if there isn\u2019t a lot of central bank activity. The low interest rate environment is where we always felt vulnerable, and we\u2019ve really done a number of things over the last few years that augment that base. So we hope you, in thinking about our company, will feel like you can safely purchase the stock for upside growth but limit your downside risk and that\u2019s really how as managers, we\u2019ve tried to position our company today.\nRich Repetto: Thanks, Jeff. Very helpful. The colors helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. My question is on the environmentals complex. And wanted to think about the size of that market and maybe if you could address the customer base there, commercial versus financial kind of utilization and as we think about it versus some of your mature markets to kind of get a sense of where we are in the adoption phase of some of these products.\nBen Jackson: Hi Dan, this is Ben. I\u2019ll take this one. We\u2019ve been spending a lot of time thinking about this in terms of the size of that marketplace. And when we look at any of our derivatives markets, we look at the underlying physical market as really a proxy for it. And the estimates out there that in any given year, you have around 50 billion tons of carbon that\u2019s emitted into the atmosphere around the world. And in the geographies where we\u2019re very strong and present right now, take North America, the EU and the UK, those geographies alone emit about 11 billion tons of carbon. And what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the derivatives markets as they mature is that it\u2019s common to see a derivatives market that would trade on top of the physical of around 10 times, if not more. So if you just use 10 times as that market matures as a proxy for how you define a TAM in the markets that we are today, that\u2019s around 110 billion tons equivalent of physical that can trade. And today, in the marketplaces that were strong, we traded 18 billion tons. So we\u2019ve hit about 16% of that TAM. And obviously, with that, there is a long runway to go in the geographies where we\u2019re strong today. And what will help feed that growth is more sectors of the economy coming in and trading these products as well as voluntarily more companies that are measuring their Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions coming in and also trading in those geographies. That adds more participants, adds more sectors of the economy and will lead to more transactions going on in the derivatives markets. The other obvious area of growth is just more geographies around the world and global programs, if they do come in place will increase the size of that physical market. But given that we represent around 95% of the world\u2019s trading that happen on our venues, we think we\u2019re very, very well-positioned to capture that growth opportunity and that TAM that I just outlined.\nDan Fannon: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning, everyone. I want to ask about inflation broadly. It\u2019s been a big topic, obviously, this earnings season in the last few months for a lot of companies. Seems like on the cost side, you\u2019re managing that pretty well, but I\u2019m more interested on the revenue side. I mean, 50% of your business or so is subscription-based. So curious to what degree CPI is built into any of your subscriptions, to what degree that could help you or make pricing discussions easier? And then, of course, how much of that is baked into your recurring revenue forecast broadly? Thank you.\nWarren Gardiner: Hey Alex, it\u2019s Warren. So yes, there is an element of that to some extent, particularly on the CPI that is in terms of building some of the data contracts. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s necessarily a huge part of it. But again, that\u2019s going to be built into part of our guide there when we talk about 5% to 6% for the year. I think on the revenue side, really the more \u2013 it\u2019s what Jeff and Ben have been talking about in terms of our exposure, if you will, to inflation, and that\u2019s really going to come down to the commodities business; the interest rate business, which is off to a great start in January; the CDS business; the ags business within that commodities business. So I think that\u2019s really more in terms of our leverage to inflation expectations, if you will, on the revenue side. On the cost side, you\u2019re right. There certainly \u2013 we were seeing some pockets of it. It\u2019s third-party kind of services, as you would imagine, or pricing providers or things of that nature, things like utility costs, some technology costs like cloud providers and things like that, that are \u2013 that we\u2019re seeing some uptick on, but that again, that\u2019s all baked into our guidance that we provided you today. And then I think on the comp side, the way to be thinking about that is, look, we\u2019ve always been a pay-for-performance culture. We obviously had a really good year this year. We always want to monitor and retain kind of the best talent that\u2019s out there. But I think we do have \u2013 we have built up some goodwill, if you will, both with employees and potential employees from that perspective. So we\u2019re comfortable with that position on the comp side. And again, all of that\u2019s baked into our expense guidance for the year, as you saw.\nAlex Kramm: Fantastic. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. Jeff, I wanted to pick your brain a little bit about crypto and blockchain, acknowledging that you and ICE were early and seeing the potential here with Bakkt and other investments. As we think about the mortgage process, is there a role you see for blockchain technology helping ICE digitize parts of the mortgage process or getting you closer to your vision in the mortgage area? And then it would seem like the information is indelible there to some of your comments at Alex\u2019s conference late last year. And then second, the crypto trading ecosystem is developing in a much more vertically integrated way. Do you see the crypto ecosystem moving more towards specialization over time like the cash equity world? Or is a chance that the cash equity ecosystem might evolve to look more like the crypto ecosystem? And does either of these have implications for the New York Stock Exchange?\nJeff Sprecher: Those are two really thoughtful questions. Thank you for those, Ken. First of all, when we think about the blockchain, we think about its main value \u2013 well, it has two values in our mind. The main value is it creates an indelible record. And so to a certain extent, property rights are something that society views as an indelible record. And it\u2019s why we have title insurance, for example, in mortgages, so that we have an insurance wrapper around title to a property. And so you can imagine that an indelible record that\u2019s accessed by many, many people, that would ensure property rights for both mortgages or homes or any other asset is something that could grow. And it\u2019s an area that we definitely are focused on. The second attribute of blockchain and the broader cryptocurrency environment is that it has captured mind share and has really been used as a marketing tool to move people from more analog brokerage houses to more digital brokerage houses and give customers direct access. So those brokerages that didn\u2019t engage their customers digitally are seeing themselves somewhat being disintermediated by new brokers that are digital. The interesting thing about your question, the third part of your question, which is really what our regulators want to do about this? And largely speaking, our whole infrastructure for regulation in the Western world has been that there is a broker that has a customer relationship, and they have the KYC and AML responsibility for their customers. They have to know their customers, and they have to do anti-money laundering checks and balances. And once having done that, they can then access the broader market. And there\u2019s been a blurring in the crypto space between the obligations of a broker-dealer and the obligations of exchange and the obligations of clearinghouse. Generally speaking, in the organized clearing markets, there are intermediaries that are providing credit amelioration to the customer. And it is the collective balance sheet of all of those brokers and clearing firms that backstop the market. And in the case of some of the crypto companies, that is not the case. And so if those \u2013 if regulators decide to subject the straight-through processing companies to the same terms and conditions that they have subjected historical companies, those companies have some work to do around KYC, AML and credit amelioration and passing the IOSCO standards of a clearinghouse that has to be stress testing, which essentially is banking. If the regulators say, you know what, maybe those issues aren\u2019t as important as we had thought they were, and maybe having the consumer directly participate end-to-end is a better way, then you are going to see the legacy companies in our industry move more to opening up their clearinghouses to end users and opening up their platforms, matching engines and other platforms directly to end users and bypassing the brokerage community. I think it\u2019s too soon to predict what will happen there, but you can \u2013 to the extent that I\u2019ve helped your thinking at all, you\u2019ll see now as you read articles about what the various regulators are doing and saying that, that is the essential question that they\u2019re wrestling with. Do they bring the legacy business towards the crypto space? Or do they bring the crypto space into the legacy business? I\u2019d make one last comment, which is largely speaking in the United States, we\u2019re subject to the Securities Act of 1934. That act has withstood a lot of change in technology and in market structures and what have you. But based in the 1934 Act is the customer protection and fraud protection. And I suspect that notwithstanding there\u2019s a lot of people wanting the 1934 Act to be updated, there\u2019s a lot of tools in the 1934 Act for regulators to even deal with new technologies as they have done now over decades. But thank you for those questions. They\u2019re very thoughtful.\nKen Worthington: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: The next question comes from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I just wanted to ask about the cloud. I was hoping you might be able to remind us, which parts of your business today are on the cloud. And as you look forward, how do you think about the opportunity for migrating more of your business to the cloud? What benefits could you see, and which parts of the organization can make sense to do sooner versus which ones do you think would take a bit more time?\nJeff Sprecher: It\u2019s a great question. We \u2013 first of all, we use the cloud and are active in the cloud in a lot of our businesses. And the main attribute that the cloud brings us is it\u2019s just another network where customers can get access to our products. We also run our own data centers, and we have our own network. And we\u2019re hooked to a lot of third-party networks. So our goal \u2013 and by the way, a lot of third-party screen providers and platform providers. So the cloud is important to us to the extent that we have clients that would prefer to receive services from us in the cloud. Where it is not as important to us is because of our scale and size, we are better able to control our costs when we\u2019re managing our own technology and network infrastructure. We have done a lot of analysis around this. And as, I think, Warren mentioned in his remarks to one of the inflationary questions, probably the highest inflation pressure that we\u2019re seeing right now is in the services that are in the cloud. We don\u2019t have good moats around our ability to control those costs notwithstanding. And so if clients, however, want to bear those costs, we\u2019re happy to provide them access through the cloud. But I think you\u2019ll see it as an important but augmented service that we have, not necessarily the key service. And last thing I would mention to you is I think we\u2019re different than some of our peers in that we have always felt that the way to control cost is to control our technology. It\u2019s not something that at its core that we license to others. It\u2019s not something at its core that we get from others, and it\u2019s not something at its core that we run in other people\u2019s infrastructures.\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hey, guys. It\u2019s Alex. So I wanted to go back to the mortgage question for a second. The \u2013 you gave some color about 2022 specifically. But clearly, it\u2019s a pretty meaningful slowdown in growth in recurring revenues into low to mid-teens from well north of 20% over the last 12 months. Do you think this is just a 2022 dynamic and the reasons you sort of described earlier just really kind of relate to the next 12 months? Or for a variety of reasons, this is more of a reasonable run rate we should expect over the medium term? Thanks.\nBen Jackson: Alex, this is Ben. So when you look at that macro environment and again, Warren used that composite estimate of around \u2013 a backdrop of the business being down \u2013 or sorry, not the business, but the overall transaction volumes being down 30%. When I look at our strategy for this business in each of the segments that we have in this business, we are executing very, very well. And what\u2019s the evidence to that? Look at each of the segments underneath there. So despite that volume decline, our data and analytics business grew year-over-year. And we\u2019ve talked on a number of these calls on how we see that playing out over time, and that will continue to be a growth driver as more of our customers adopt automation. We also have our closing line item that\u2019s grown year-over-year as we\u2019ve invested a lot in \u2013 did a lot of brand-new innovations that the industry has not seen before over this past year. And as customers ramp on those, we\u2019re starting to see some substantial ramp-up on that, and that\u2019s leading to growth in that line item year-over-year. And on the origination line item, we way outperformed what industry transaction volumes were. And underneath the covers there, it\u2019s an explicit move towards more and more subscription. So we feel great about how the business is executing despite this near-term drop in volumes. It\u2019s hard to predict how long those \u2013 the drop in volumes will play out, but we feel good on our ability to grow this business and to outperform the industry backdrop based on our strategy in each one of those. And remember, on the \u2013 we just started that pilot program that was last year in terms of as every customer renews for a small percentage of them, we are shifting the revenue more and more towards subscription, and roughly 20% renew in a given year. And this year, we\u2019ve really codified a program to hit a much larger percentage. We have a long runway, I mean, doing the math. We have a long runway to execute that over many, many years that we believe we\u2019ll continue to lead to growth in that subscription line item.\nAlex Blostein: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Maybe, Ben, if I could just come back to the environmental complex question and your answer to a prior question on that. Two-parter. First, on the 110 tons \u2013 110 billion tons of physical TAM that you mentioned, I just wanted to clarify if that is sort of a current TAM and then your expectations for that to grow over time as we move more into carbon transition. And then secondarily, it looks like the environmentals complex is now north of 10% of your energy revenue. Nat gas is also inching up as well, 25% or so. What is your view on nat gas as a transition energy and whether if we want to think about a long-term carbon transition, should we be thinking about that nat gas to grow as a portion of your total energy revenue, just like the environmental is growing?\nBen Jackson: Yes. Okay. Thanks, Brian. So on that 110 billion tons of physical equivalent traded, yes. The estimate I used there, so that\u2019s again just based on the geographies where we are now. So that\u2019s North America, EU and UK and putting a 10x multiple on that. And as you picked up there and the way you asked the question, that\u2019s as markets are maturing, we see it can get to 10% but even order of magnitude more than that. If you take very well-established benchmarks, it can be 2, 3x that easily. So we see this as a market that as it matures can get bigger than that. So I see that as more of kind of a near to medium-term TAM that can be achieved in that environmental markets. But then also as more geographies get added around the world and as more of the overall $50 billion \u2013 sorry, 50 billion tons of carbon emissions that are happening around the world as more of that adds more programs, as more governments around the world add programs, we have an opportunity to go after that as well. So there\u2019s an acceleration that could happen on that over time. On the nat gas, you pointed out, environmental is at 10%, natural gas also continuing to grow. Our natural gas business is really the only global gas business around the world. Our TTF business continues to grow on top of growth. So you\u2019ve seen that continue to compound and customers coming to us around the world to manage their risk and using natural gas as the cleanest of the fossil fuels to help with this energy transition. And with the backdrop of industry estimates saying that energy demand is likely to double between now and 2050, we see that, that\u2019s going to be an important element in this transition towards a cleaner environment. And that this transition is going to be bumpy. And we\u2019re pleased to see that our customers are coming to as much \u2013 coming to us as much as ever to manage the risk in that environment.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Owen Lau with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.\nOwen Lau: Good morning and thank you for taking my question. Could you please talk about your balance sheet investment? What\u2019s your plan to like maybe deconsolidate OCC and Bakkt? Or you will be more opportunistic to leverage your balance sheet to make additional investments? Thank you.\nWarren Gardiner: Hey, Owen, it\u2019s Warren. So with respect to Bakkt, as you probably recall, it was \u2013 we did deconsolidate that in the fourth quarter. It went public in October. So that is \u2013 certainly, we have a state that\u2019s on our balance sheet. That\u2019s an investment we\u2019ve been making over a number of years that we\u2019ve been very happy with and have a lot of confidence in the outlook for that business. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to update there in terms of any kind of plans on that front. With respect to OCC, that is something that\u2019s on our balance sheet. We hit \u2013 I don\u2019t recall the exact mark of it, but it\u2019s a small investment that we have there. So we\u2019ll see if there\u2019s any opportunity there. But I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that, that\u2019s something we\u2019re thinking about at the moment. Certainly, it\u2019s part of what we do in the options and equity side to begin with. So I wouldn\u2019t be thinking about that. So we do, over time, as you know, with Euroclear and some of the other investments, we do look for opportunities that are within \u2013 that are sort of adjacent to what we do in our business. And so we will look for those opportunities and invest in those as we see it. So I think you could expect us to continue to do that when those opportunities arise. But those 10 \u2013 those will be sort of minority investment, small minority investors for the most part, as you\u2019ve seen with some of the ones we\u2019ve done in the past.\nOwen Lau: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. I just wanted to ask a question still on the energy topic, specifically on Brent and Brent open interest. We\u2019re seeing nice growth in the options OI in that complex, but Brent futures open interest specifically was down 17% year-on-year as of earlier this week. So I guess with the price volatility we\u2019ve seen the oil market over the past year, I just would have expected to see a bit stronger trends there. Just wondering if you could kind of opine on whether you think this is cyclical still related to kind of COVID normalization or whether there\u2019s something more secular going on there that\u2019s causing the decline would be helpful. Thank you.\nBen Jackson: Thanks, Kyle. Yes. So we do see this as temporary. If you look at Brent overall, open interest today is about 5% over last year. You got to remember last year was also another very volatile year, where we saw tremendous growth in that business. So you are looking at a compare that\u2019s difficult. But on top of that, we\u2019re still growing that business and growing that business nicely. In addition, in oil overall, we have had a lot of success working with many of the physical industry participants in some brand-new innovations and ways for them to help manage their risk in the oil markets. The example would be ICE Futures Abu Dhabi that we launched last year to help people hedge and come up with a market price for hedging Murban crude oil that\u2019s going to Asia. And then just within two weeks ago, we launched our new HOU contract, which is Midland WTI American Gulf Coast contract, where we were selected by the industry to come up with a better way to price Midland TI as it gets to the Gulf and is going overseas. And both of those contracts have seen tremendous amount of pickup in physical market participants supporting it in early days, and we see those as highly complementary to the overall Brent complex. So it\u2019s an area we\u2019re going to continue to invest. We do see the COVID environment and jurisdictions and geographies opening and closing, opening and closing, unfortunately, does create some gyrations in here. But overall, we feel great about the oil complex.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Ely on for Craig. I had a question for you on December\u2019s leadership changes. Should we see those as a precursor to more meaningful strategy changes at NYSE? Or do you anticipate any changes will be more incremental? Specifically on listings, has the new team given any thought to lowering listing standards to help make the New York Stock Exchange a little more competitive in 2022 or maybe pivoting the brand to better appeal to all the new tech companies coming to public markets? Thanks.\nJeff Sprecher: Sure. Good question. This is Jeff. I\u2019m surrounded by a generation that\u2019s younger than me, that\u2019s incredibly talented, that delivered the best year in our history. And those changes were an opportunity to start to put leaders in that generation. And because the company is so broad now and so geographically diverse, we\u2019re trying to give people in that leadership team opportunities to try their skills in different businesses and give them exposure to the markets. So I was thrilled to be able to ask Lynn Martin if she would lead the New York Stock Exchange. And I\u2019ll let her tell you what she\u2019s thinking.\nLynn Martin: Yes. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks for the question. I mean, it\u2019s early days of me being in the seat at NYSE, but I continue to see a great opportunity to further cement NYSE as the home of global markets. We\u2019ve got \u2013 as I think about this year, we\u2019ve got a healthy pipeline of IPOs, although the timing of some of the companies coming to market is shifting a bit, given the macroeconomic environment. But importantly, we really see the environment changing. And the drivers of capital raising last year may have favored our competitors. So we see that shifting, given the strengths of our model. The issuers that I have been talking to more recently, CEOs that are looking to come to market, they\u2019re valuing different things. And they\u2019re valuing stability in trading, lower cost of capital and strong governance, and that really favors the NYSE market model. And our message around our market model, the differentiation and investment we\u2019ve made in technology and also the broader technology assets that we\u2019re bringing to bear through the various other ICE businesses are really resonating as differentiators for the New York Stock Exchange.\nUnidentified Analyst: Got it. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.\nSimon Clinch: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to do a housekeeping really on the CapEx guidance. I was wondering if you could give us a bit more color as to how to think about CapEx going forward? And particularly, what\u2019s really driving that growth in \u2013 if you can tease out sort of the separate drivers for fiscal 2022?\nWarren Gardiner: Sure. Hey Simon, it\u2019s Warren. So right. So we were about $450 million, as you know, this year. That was kind of towards the high end of the range. Some of that is related to Bakkt. Of course, we had a full year of Ellie Mae. As you\u2019re looking at the guidance for next year, as you saw, it\u2019s about $520 million to $490 million. We are planning some data center migrations and some upgrades. That\u2019s adding about $80 million or so to that $590 million to \u2013 sorry, $520 million to $490 million. Those are going to result eventually in some cost savings. There\u2019s revenue-related expansion product \u2013 project within that. So all kind of good things on the back end of that investment. Within that guidance range of this year, probably around $100 million of Ellie Mae, too. So when you start to back \u2013 to peel off those pieces, well, you\u2019re back down to sort of the 300, 350 range, which is where we\u2019ll call it legacy ICE was and has been for a number of years prior to that acquisition and some of these productivity and efficiency investments that we\u2019re going to be making around some of the data center.\nSimon Clinch: Great. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And we have a follow-up from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, just a couple of quick follow-ups here. One on the mortgage side. Maybe I missed it, but can you give us an update in terms of where you stand with subscribers on eClose? And then also where we are in the subscription or subscription kind of like transition in terms of how many of your clients have now transitioned? I know it\u2019s about 20% a year, but just maybe an update there. And then also on the trading side, very quick. Obviously, with the contract transitions here in your IBOR, obviously, the rate book contract has been moving higher. We see that in your January number \u2013 numbers. I know it\u2019s a three-month lag number, and I can probably do the math, but just wondering what\u2019s a good RPC to use for the quarter or where we are running in January alone? Any color would be great. Thanks guys.\nBen Jackson: Alex, I\u2019ll start on the mortgage side. I can give some color on the short-term interest rate transition as well. In terms of eClose, we\u2019re continuing to see that ramp. So we went to \u2013 we were at 76 customers last quarter and the last update here. We\u2019re now at 93. So we\u2019re continuing to see that pick up and ramp up. And we see as those customers ramp up, that\u2019s going to be yet another area that grows that closing line item on a year-over-year basis as that closing line item is going to be heavily transaction-oriented because a lot of the costs associated to closing fees actually go on to the end closing statement of the customer. So that is important to highlight that. And as we deliver more and more of these innovations and solutions, we are able to capture more revenue per loan, which is something that\u2019s important on that closing line item. On the subscription line item, so last year is when we started that pilot program, and we did a small percentage of what renewed. So if you take a ballpark of around 10% of the 20% that renewed, that\u2019s probably the right ZIP code of the number that we touched last year. And based on what we learned through that pilot program, we\u2019ve now codified a program that\u2019s going to hit a much larger percentage of the 20% that are going to renew this year. So that gets you into the ballpark of what we have accomplished being a very small percentage and that we do have a long runway of being able to do this over multiple years ahead of us. Just from the overall short-term interest rate transition and what we\u2019re seeing in that marketplace, that transition went seamless for us in terms of the short sterling to SONIA transition. We\u2019ve seen \u2013 we did have some trading volumes, some ARB trading volume that was trading short sterling versus SONIA. That obviously, when short sterling went away, came off. But when you look at the overall complex and this rising rate environment that we\u2019re in, in both the U.K. as well as the EU, the market overall is off to a great start in terms of both volumes as well as open interest. I\u2019ll hand it off to Warren to talk about RPC.\nWarren Gardiner: Yes, Alex, just quickly on the rates RPC. So yes, you\u2019re seeing a little bit of lift there. As we kind of transition into SONIA, as you know, that\u2019s a much bigger contract than what we had on the short sterling side. So there\u2019s a equivalent benefit, if you will, from the RPC to kind of account for that. So the revenue, if you were to look at it just on a revenue basis, that should be relatively neutral if you\u2019re thinking about it on a notional level. The other impacting factor there \u2013 and so I think at this current level, you\u2019re probably at a good place for that interest rate RPC moving forward. Obviously, the impact can be for mix, medium-term versus short-term rates of our rates overall. And then, of course, there\u2019s a component of FX that can flow through there as well. But again, all else equal, I think it\u2019s kind of a good \u2013 what we reported this month is a good run rate to be kind of thinking about for that component of our future business.\nAlex Kramm: Sounds good. I will follow up on that. Thanks.\nOperator: And I understand there\u2019s time for one more follow-up. That is from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hey, thanks for squeezing my follow-up. So just on the expenses, the midpoint of the expense guidance, I think, is 5% year-on-year growth comparing to the adjusted OpEx, excluding Bakkt. Just wondering if you could talk about how committed you are to delivering operating leverage in 2022 specifically? Again, if we\u2019re looking at the business on an adjusted basis, excluding Bakkt. And then given the business mix change over the past five years or so, just wondering if you can update us on your view of long-term expense growth, what\u2019s the right expense growth rate long term for ICE? Thanks.\nWarren Gardiner: Sure. Sure. Thanks, Kyle. Good question. So you\u2019re right. At the midpoint, it\u2019s about 5% growth. Again, as I said in my remarks, there\u2019s a portion of that that we\u2019re electing to invest related to the IPO of Bakkt. So some of the operating savings that we had from Bakkt, it\u2019s about \u2013 if you include revenue, it\u2019s about $75 million of savings that we got from Bakkt. We\u2019re going to invest a portion of that this year in some of the tech and ops projects. So that\u2019s probably about a point of that, if you will, of that five at the midpoint that is coming from that. And those are things that certainly, we would have done, and we would do over time. But just given the opportunity we had with those savings, we chose to elect to do them now. And so look, ICE has always been conscious about cost controls and being good on expense controls and things of that nature. And so we did take that opportunity to do that in order to kind of save that later. But I think as you\u2019re thinking about it longer term, it\u2019s what it\u2019s been in the past. And then we\u2019ve talked about compensation expense being kind of lower single-digit growth in terms of merit annually. That\u2019s about half of our expense base. I think that when you think about noncomp expense, it\u2019s probably in a similar range. So I think a lower single-digit kind of expense growth range on an organic basis is a fair place to be. And again, that\u2019s against revenue. We don\u2019t give top line revenue growth overall for the business, but I think it\u2019s safe to assume that within the context of revenues growing faster than expenses. I think for instance, this year, we added $500 million of incremental revenue, which yielded $380 million or so of operating income. That\u2019s about a 75% incremental margin. So I think, yes, we\u2019re very much committed to that. Transaction business can certainly fluctuate here and there, but over the medium, long term, yes, we would certainly expect that operating leverage to flow through.\nKyle Voigt: Great. Thanks, Warren.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks.\nJeff Sprecher: Well, thank you, Andrew, for running the call, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to soon updating you as we continue to innovate for our customers and give you the results of our all-weather business model as we continue to drive growth. And with that, I hope you have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks, MC. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our fourth quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.34, up 17% year-over-year, marking the best quarter in our company's history. Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion and increased 10% versus last year. Total transaction revenues grew 11%, while total recurring revenues, which account for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $749 million, slightly higher than expected, driven by additional severance as well as higher performance-based compensation due to the strong results to finish the year. Adjusted operating income increased by 14%, totaling a record $1.1 billion. This strong operating performance contributed to a record full year free cash flow of over $2.8 billion, of which we returned $1 billion to shareholders through dividends and buybacks, while also reducing our gross leverage to 3x EBITDA, nearly a full year ahead of schedule. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled $1 billion, an increase of 17% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 71% increase in our interest rate business and a 29% increase in our energy revenues, both driven in part by rising inflation expectations. Revenues within our global oil complex increased 29% year-over-year, while natural gas and environmental products, which represent approximately 40% of our energy revenues, increased by 36% in the quarter and were up 20% for the full year. Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business, increased by 8% year-over-year, including 10% growth in listings. Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $480 million, a 7% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 7% in the quarter. Within recurring revenues, our fixed income, data and analytics business increased by 6% year-over-year, including another quarter of double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 7% driven by continued demand for our ICE Global Network and consolidated fees offering. For the full year, data services revenue increased by 6%. And importantly, annual subscription value, or ASV, enters the first quarter up 5.5%, setting us up for yet another strong year of compounding revenue growth. Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Fourth quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $346 million. Recurring revenues, which accounted for over 40% of segment revenues, totaled $149 million and grew 26% year-over-year. While total Mortgage Technology revenues declined slightly, down 1% in the fourth quarter, we outperformed an industry that experienced a roughly 30% decline in origination volumes. For the full year, Mortgage Technology revenues grew 17% on a pro forma basis, reaching $1.4 billion well ahead of our initial expectations and on track to achieve our target of more than doubling revenues over a 10-year period. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with some additional guidance. We expect full year total recurring revenues to be between $3.68 billion and $3.75 billion. This includes approximately $30 million of headwinds related to FX, the planned phase-out of sterling LIBOR and Euronext post-Brexit decision to migrate certain connectivity services away from our UK data center and on to the continent. It is worth noting that the majority of Euronext connectivity revenues are expected to be offset by a related reduction in costs. Adjusting for these items, we expect core growth in our recurring revenues, which again account for half of our business, to be approximately 6% to 8% for the full year. This strong growth, which is on top of 10% growth last year, is expected to once again be led by our Mortgage Technology business, which we expect will grow in the low to mid-teens and importantly, is on top of an exceptional 30% growth in 2021. In addition, and supported by an ASV that exits the fourth quarter up 5.5%, we anticipate another year of 5% to 6% growth in our Fixed Income and Data Services recurring revenues. Moving to expenses. We expect 2022 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.99 billion to $3.04 billion. Consistent with prior years, we will reward our employees for their contributions to our strong results and therefore, expect compensation expense, net of synergies and the resetting of 2021 performance awards, to increase by $25 million to $35 million. Expenses tied to revenues are also expected to increase by $25 million to $35 million driven by higher license fees as well as investments in business and product development across all three of our segments. In addition, we expect an incremental $40 million to $60 million in support of productivity and efficiency initiatives across our technology and operations groups, a portion of which we are electing to fund through the net operating savings we realized following the IPO of Bakkt. Lastly, and similar to last year, we expect roughly $30 million of incremental D&A expense related to purchase accounting and the rebuild of Ellie Mae CapEx. Please see Slide 12 in the appendix for a bridge reconciling our expense guidance to 2021. Moving next to capital allocation and consistent with our track record of growing our dividend as we grow, we plan to increase our quarterly dividend by 15% year-over-year from $0.33 per share to $0.38 per share. In addition, and now that we are within our targeted leverage range, we expect to deploy approximately $475 million towards share repurchases in the first quarter, representing a nearly 20% increase versus the second quarter of 2020, the last full quarter of buybacks prior to our acquisition of Ellie Mae. In summary, we delivered a record finish to another record year. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also invested in an array of future growth initiatives, increased our dividend double digits and achieved our leverage target a year earlier than originally planned. As we kick off 2022, we're focused on, once again, delivering growth and creating shareholder value against what is an ever evolving macro backdrop. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben. Hey Alex, it's Warren. So yes, there is an element of that to some extent, particularly on the CPI that is in terms of building some of the data contracts. I wouldn't say it's necessarily a huge part of it. But again, that's going to be built into part of our guide there when we talk about 5% to 6% for the year. I think on the revenue side, really the more \u2013 it's what Jeff and Ben have been talking about in terms of our exposure, if you will, to inflation, and that's really going to come down to the commodities business; the interest rate business, which is off to a great start in January; the CDS business; the ags business within that commodities business. So I think that's really more in terms of our leverage to inflation expectations, if you will, on the revenue side. On the cost side, you're right. There certainly \u2013 we were seeing some pockets of it. It's third-party kind of services, as you would imagine, or pricing providers or things of that nature, things like utility costs, some technology costs like cloud providers and things like that, that are \u2013 that we're seeing some uptick on, but that again, that's all baked into our guidance that we provided you today. And then I think on the comp side, the way to be thinking about that is, look, we've always been a pay-for-performance culture. We obviously had a really good year this year. We always want to monitor and retain kind of the best talent that's out there. But I think we do have \u2013 we have built up some goodwill, if you will, both with employees and potential employees from that perspective. So we're comfortable with that position on the comp side. And again, all of that's baked into our expense guidance for the year, as you saw. Hey, Owen, it's Warren. So with respect to Bakkt, as you probably recall, it was \u2013 we did deconsolidate that in the fourth quarter. It went public in October. So that is \u2013 certainly, we have a state that's on our balance sheet. That's an investment we've been making over a number of years that we've been very happy with and have a lot of confidence in the outlook for that business. So I don't think there's anything to update there in terms of any kind of plans on that front. With respect to OCC, that is something that's on our balance sheet. We hit \u2013 I don't recall the exact mark of it, but it's a small investment that we have there. So we'll see if there's any opportunity there. But I wouldn't necessarily say that, that's something we're thinking about at the moment. Certainly, it's part of what we do in the options and equity side to begin with. So I wouldn't be thinking about that. So we do, over time, as you know, with Euroclear and some of the other investments, we do look for opportunities that are within \u2013 that are sort of adjacent to what we do in our business. And so we will look for those opportunities and invest in those as we see it. So I think you could expect us to continue to do that when those opportunities arise. But those 10 \u2013 those will be sort of minority investment, small minority investors for the most part, as you've seen with some of the ones we've done in the past. Sure. Hey Simon, it's Warren. So right. So we were about $450 million, as you know, this year. That was kind of towards the high end of the range. Some of that is related to Bakkt. Of course, we had a full year of Ellie Mae. As you're looking at the guidance for next year, as you saw, it's about $520 million to $490 million. We are planning some data center migrations and some upgrades. That's adding about $80 million or so to that $590 million to \u2013 sorry, $520 million to $490 million. Those are going to result eventually in some cost savings. There's revenue-related expansion product \u2013 project within that. So all kind of good things on the back end of that investment. Within that guidance range of this year, probably around $100 million of Ellie Mae, too. So when you start to back \u2013 to peel off those pieces, well, you're back down to sort of the 300, 350 range, which is where we'll call it legacy ICE was and has been for a number of years prior to that acquisition and some of these productivity and efficiency investments that we're going to be making around some of the data center. Yes, Alex, just quickly on the rates RPC. So yes, you're seeing a little bit of lift there. As we kind of transition into SONIA, as you know, that's a much bigger contract than what we had on the short sterling side. So there's a equivalent benefit, if you will, from the RPC to kind of account for that. So the revenue, if you were to look at it just on a revenue basis, that should be relatively neutral if you're thinking about it on a notional level. The other impacting factor there \u2013 and so I think at this current level, you're probably at a good place for that interest rate RPC moving forward. Obviously, the impact can be for mix, medium-term versus short-term rates of our rates overall. And then, of course, there's a component of FX that can flow through there as well. But again, all else equal, I think it's kind of a good \u2013 what we reported this month is a good run rate to be kind of thinking about for that component of our future business. Sure. Sure. Thanks, Kyle. Good question. So you're right. At the midpoint, it's about 5% growth. Again, as I said in my remarks, there's a portion of that that we're electing to invest related to the IPO of Bakkt. So some of the operating savings that we had from Bakkt, it's about \u2013 if you include revenue, it's about $75 million of savings that we got from Bakkt. We're going to invest a portion of that this year in some of the tech and ops projects. So that's probably about a point of that, if you will, of that five at the midpoint that is coming from that. And those are things that certainly, we would have done, and we would do over time. But just given the opportunity we had with those savings, we chose to elect to do them now. And so look, ICE has always been conscious about cost controls and being good on expense controls and things of that nature. And so we did take that opportunity to do that in order to kind of save that later. But I think as you're thinking about it longer term, it's what it's been in the past. And then we've talked about compensation expense being kind of lower single-digit growth in terms of merit annually. That's about half of our expense base. I think that when you think about noncomp expense, it's probably in a similar range. So I think a lower single-digit kind of expense growth range on an organic basis is a fair place to be. And again, that's against revenue. We don't give top line revenue growth overall for the business, but I think it's safe to assume that within the context of revenues growing faster than expenses. I think for instance, this year, we added $500 million of incremental revenue, which yielded $380 million or so of operating income. That's about a 75% incremental margin. So I think, yes, we're very much committed to that. Transaction business can certainly fluctuate here and there, but over the medium, long term, yes, we would certainly expect that operating leverage to flow through."

            "name": "Jeff Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Lynn, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn now to Slide 10. 2021 marked our 16th consecutive year of record revenues and record adjusted earnings per share. This track record of growth reflects our strategy to diversify the business and position the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion, a strategy that has made ICE an all-weather name, a business model that provides upside to volatility with less downside risk and importantly, a positioning that drives growth on top of growth. We have intentionally diversified across asset classes so that we are not tied to any one cyclical trend or one macroeconomic environment. For example, in 2021, we saw record volumes across our energy complex driven in part by inflationary concerns and market speculation of central bank activity. Our European and UK interest rate business also benefited from interest rate volatility, driving a 15% increase in revenues in 2021 and more recently, a 34% increase in our January revenues. Our CDS clearing business grew 14% in the fourth quarter as rate volatility increased, driving demand for risk management and credit protection. And even against this backdrop of rising interest rates, our Mortgage Technology business outperformed the broader market, including pro forma recurring revenue growth in 2021, up 31%, again, a reflection of the all-weather nature of our business model. As we begin 2022, we are better positioned than ever to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes. And we remain focused on investing and executing on the many growth opportunities in front of us. Before we end our prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in 2021, and I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their continued efforts. Your hard work contributed to the best quarter in our company's history combined with other excellent results, making it the best year in our company's history. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Andrew, our operator, to conduct the question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time. And Rich, this is Jeff. Yes, we've really thought hard over the last few years on how to position the company to be an all-weather name that will just grow on top of growth and in all macro environments and global geographies. And so our thinking is that inflationary pressures are what drive central banks to raise interest rates. And we have a lot of asset classes that we participate in and positioning of the company that will benefit from that volatility. And we tend to see commodity businesses like energy and agricultural commodities be very volatile in inflationary environments. And therefore, there's a lot of hedging, and we help people manage that risk. Similarly, obviously, in our interest rate businesses, which include interest rate futures and credit default swaps and fixed income data and services in a volatile interest rate environment, those businesses do well. And even in the mortgage space, as Ben has been talking about, home inflation tends to drive people to do cash-out refinancings, which for us, refinancing a house versus buying a new house is the same transaction to our mortgage platform. So we really feel like we've positioned the company well in this environment. We also feel like we positioned the company well if there isn't inflation, if there isn't a lot of central bank activity. The low interest rate environment is where we always felt vulnerable, and we've really done a number of things over the last few years that augment that base. So we hope you, in thinking about our company, will feel like you can safely purchase the stock for upside growth but limit your downside risk and that's really how as managers, we've tried to position our company today. Those are two really thoughtful questions. Thank you for those, Ken. First of all, when we think about the blockchain, we think about its main value \u2013 well, it has two values in our mind. The main value is it creates an indelible record. And so to a certain extent, property rights are something that society views as an indelible record. And it's why we have title insurance, for example, in mortgages, so that we have an insurance wrapper around title to a property. And so you can imagine that an indelible record that's accessed by many, many people, that would ensure property rights for both mortgages or homes or any other asset is something that could grow. And it's an area that we definitely are focused on. The second attribute of blockchain and the broader cryptocurrency environment is that it has captured mind share and has really been used as a marketing tool to move people from more analog brokerage houses to more digital brokerage houses and give customers direct access. So those brokerages that didn't engage their customers digitally are seeing themselves somewhat being disintermediated by new brokers that are digital. The interesting thing about your question, the third part of your question, which is really what our regulators want to do about this? And largely speaking, our whole infrastructure for regulation in the Western world has been that there is a broker that has a customer relationship, and they have the KYC and AML responsibility for their customers. They have to know their customers, and they have to do anti-money laundering checks and balances. And once having done that, they can then access the broader market. And there's been a blurring in the crypto space between the obligations of a broker-dealer and the obligations of exchange and the obligations of clearinghouse. Generally speaking, in the organized clearing markets, there are intermediaries that are providing credit amelioration to the customer. And it is the collective balance sheet of all of those brokers and clearing firms that backstop the market. And in the case of some of the crypto companies, that is not the case. And so if those \u2013 if regulators decide to subject the straight-through processing companies to the same terms and conditions that they have subjected historical companies, those companies have some work to do around KYC, AML and credit amelioration and passing the IOSCO standards of a clearinghouse that has to be stress testing, which essentially is banking. If the regulators say, you know what, maybe those issues aren't as important as we had thought they were, and maybe having the consumer directly participate end-to-end is a better way, then you are going to see the legacy companies in our industry move more to opening up their clearinghouses to end users and opening up their platforms, matching engines and other platforms directly to end users and bypassing the brokerage community. I think it's too soon to predict what will happen there, but you can \u2013 to the extent that I've helped your thinking at all, you'll see now as you read articles about what the various regulators are doing and saying that, that is the essential question that they're wrestling with. Do they bring the legacy business towards the crypto space? Or do they bring the crypto space into the legacy business? I'd make one last comment, which is largely speaking in the United States, we're subject to the Securities Act of 1934. That act has withstood a lot of change in technology and in market structures and what have you. But based in the 1934 Act is the customer protection and fraud protection. And I suspect that notwithstanding there's a lot of people wanting the 1934 Act to be updated, there's a lot of tools in the 1934 Act for regulators to even deal with new technologies as they have done now over decades. But thank you for those questions. They're very thoughtful. It's a great question. We \u2013 first of all, we use the cloud and are active in the cloud in a lot of our businesses. And the main attribute that the cloud brings us is it's just another network where customers can get access to our products. We also run our own data centers, and we have our own network. And we're hooked to a lot of third-party networks. So our goal \u2013 and by the way, a lot of third-party screen providers and platform providers. So the cloud is important to us to the extent that we have clients that would prefer to receive services from us in the cloud. Where it is not as important to us is because of our scale and size, we are better able to control our costs when we're managing our own technology and network infrastructure. We have done a lot of analysis around this. And as, I think, Warren mentioned in his remarks to one of the inflationary questions, probably the highest inflation pressure that we're seeing right now is in the services that are in the cloud. We don't have good moats around our ability to control those costs notwithstanding. And so if clients, however, want to bear those costs, we're happy to provide them access through the cloud. But I think you'll see it as an important but augmented service that we have, not necessarily the key service. And last thing I would mention to you is I think we're different than some of our peers in that we have always felt that the way to control cost is to control our technology. It's not something that at its core that we license to others. It's not something at its core that we get from others, and it's not something at its core that we run in other people's infrastructures. Sure. Good question. This is Jeff. I'm surrounded by a generation that's younger than me, that's incredibly talented, that delivered the best year in our history. And those changes were an opportunity to start to put leaders in that generation. And because the company is so broad now and so geographically diverse, we're trying to give people in that leadership team opportunities to try their skills in different businesses and give them exposure to the markets. So I was thrilled to be able to ask Lynn Martin if she would lead the New York Stock Exchange. And I'll let her tell you what she's thinking. Well, thank you, Andrew, for running the call, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to soon updating you as we continue to innovate for our customers and give you the results of our all-weather business model as we continue to drive growth. And with that, I hope you have a great day."

            "name": "Lynn Martin",
            "content": "Thank you, Ben. With data and technology at our core, our goal is to provide solutions which add transparency to both commonly understood risks as well as emerging risks such as ESG. We continue to increase the breadth and coverage of our products and accelerate the delivery of our ESG reference data to the NYSE issuer community, providing non-opinion-based insights to market participants. And in the fourth quarter, we expanded our climate change and alternative data capabilities with the acquisition of risQ and Level 11 Analytics. Combining geospatial data technology with our financial data will bring greater transparency to ESG risks across the financial markets, including our existing muni bond and mortgage-backed security offering. Our data, technology and leading marketplaces position us well to benefit from the secular trend towards sustainability and net zero carbon commitments. Turning now to fixed income. Increased automation, flexibility of delivery and passive investing continue to drive demand for our proprietary data and rapidly growing index business. As a leading data provider to the fixed income market, we are uniquely positioned to drive automation. Leveraging our proprietary evaluated prices, analytics and our growing suite of reference data, we've taken a business that historically served the back and middle office and created tools and analytics for the front office. These tools are critical to the pre-trade transparency needed in the opaque, less liquid fixed income markets as is evidenced by our front-office tools continuing to grow double-digits. The growth in passive investing continues to be a tailwind for our business. The flexibility of our tools, quality of our pricing data and flexibility of our offering directly contributed to the five asset managers with funds of over $66 billion of AUM that transitioned to ICE indices during 2021 and an additional group of funds with AUM of $6.7 billion have planned transitions during Q1 2022. This strength drove double-digit revenue growth in our index business for the fourth consecutive year and positions us well for continued growth. I'll close with some highlights from the NYSE. 2021 was a record year for NYSE listings. We help connect innovators and entrepreneurs to nearly $120 billion in capital through 297 IPOs, including three of the four largest IPOs and the three largest tech IPOs. And importantly, we continue to lead the market in ETF listings with more than 65% of new funds selecting us as their home. We also continue to prioritize our market-leading technology, which enables customers to better manage risk and provide our issuer community with significantly less volatility at the open and the close. The performance of our technology was proven as recently as last week when we processed nearly 0.5 trillion messages in a single day with median response times of less than 30 microseconds across our equities complex, further cementing our position as the leading equity exchange group. Our leading data and technology coupled with our investments in sustainable finance, the secular trends across fixed income markets and the competitive differentiators of the NYSE will continue to drive our growth well into the future. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Yes. Thanks, Jeff, and thanks for the question. I mean, it's early days of me being in the seat at NYSE, but I continue to see a great opportunity to further cement NYSE as the home of global markets. We've got \u2013 as I think about this year, we've got a healthy pipeline of IPOs, although the timing of some of the companies coming to market is shifting a bit, given the macroeconomic environment. But importantly, we really see the environment changing. And the drivers of capital raising last year may have favored our competitors. So we see that shifting, given the strengths of our model. The issuers that I have been talking to more recently, CEOs that are looking to come to market, they're valuing different things. And they're valuing stability in trading, lower cost of capital and strong governance, and that really favors the NYSE market model. And our message around our market model, the differentiation and investment we've made in technology and also the broader technology assets that we're bringing to bear through the various other ICE businesses are really resonating as differentiators for the New York Stock Exchange."

            "name": "Ben Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. We are pleased to report another record year for ICE. Our strong financial results reflect the tremendous efforts of my colleagues across the organization, the trust and expanding relationship we have with our customers and the ability of our business model to drive growth across a variety of macroeconomic environments. I'd like to focus on the secular trends that are driving growth across our mortgage and energy markets. And we'll turn it over to Lynn to discuss our position across fixed income, data and analytics and some highlights from our great year at the NYSE. Our data, technology and network expertise position us well to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening across the mortgage industry. As mortgage origination costs continue to increase, electronification is a trend we believe will continue in a variety of interest rate environments and regardless of mortgage origination volumes. Our ability to capture this secular trend is evidenced by the strength and resiliency of our recurring revenues. Part of that growth is driven by our strategy to intentionally shift more business to recurring revenue. We also continue to see strong sales and new customers coming on to the platform. And with connectivity to nearly every participant in the mortgage industry, we have the opportunity to cross-sell new products like eClose and AIQ to a captive customer base seeking efficiencies. This flywheel effect and the secular trend of electronification give us confidence in our ability to grow this business and capture the $10 billion addressable market. Across our energy markets, we achieved record volumes in 2021, including in Brent, TTF and environmentals. The breadth and depth of our platform not only drove strong volumes and revenues, but more importantly, it positions us to capture secular tailwinds across our energy complex, including the globalization of natural gas in the clean energy transition. We have built a global natural gas business, including our European marker, TTF. The globalization of natural gas and the rise of LNG have driven TTF to emerge as the global gas benchmark. And in 2021, record volumes on our platform grew 45% and drove revenue growth of 36%. Our markets continue to be relied on by an increasing number of participants to manage risk and navigate volatile gas and power markets. We were also early to diversify into environmentals, acquiring the Climate Exchange in 2010 and building around those leading markets to develop a global environmental business. And in 2021, we reached record volumes across the complex, including in our EU, UK renewable greenhouse gas initiatives and California carbon allowances. These record volumes contributed to a 56% increase in environmental revenues versus the prior year. As customers navigate the uncertainty and volatility related to the clean energy transition, we are well positioned as the venue of choice to manage risk and provide price transparency across the energy spectrum. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Lynn. Hi Rich, it's Ben. I'll start here. So the \u2013 you hit on it a bit in the way you answered the question. So you do have growth compounding on top of growth there in the subscription side of the business. But also, I mean, we are looking at macro headwinds. I mean, Warren brought up in his commentary that if you take a composite of where the industry analysts have volumes that you have volumes down 30%. And in that environment, we could see some macro headwinds such as are there going to be a bunch of brand-new originators coming on to the scene? Potentially not. Could you see some industry consolidation? Potentially, we'll see some of that. But despite those types of headwinds, we see an opportunity to grow this subscription business in the teens because we have great visibility to a phenomenal new business pipeline of new customers that we're looking at right now. We have the ability to cross-sell to that large stable of customers that we have solutions like our AIQ business, that will provide them more efficiency as well as our industry-leading point-of-sale solutions. And then the other dynamic that we have going on is that move towards subscription as customers renew. We had a pilot program last year where we have roughly 20% of our customers renew in a given year. With a small percentage of those that renewed last year, we looked at shifting them more towards subscription. We're successful doing that. And we've codified a program of this year to hit a much larger percentage of the roughly 20% that are renewing this year. So all of those, we believe, are tailwinds to offset the macroeconomic environments there and will lead to a teens grower in subscription revenue, which we feel great about. Hi Dan, this is Ben. I'll take this one. We've been spending a lot of time thinking about this in terms of the size of that marketplace. And when we look at any of our derivatives markets, we look at the underlying physical market as really a proxy for it. And the estimates out there that in any given year, you have around 50 billion tons of carbon that's emitted into the atmosphere around the world. And in the geographies where we're very strong and present right now, take North America, the EU and the UK, those geographies alone emit about 11 billion tons of carbon. And what we've seen in terms of the derivatives markets as they mature is that it's common to see a derivatives market that would trade on top of the physical of around 10 times, if not more. So if you just use 10 times as that market matures as a proxy for how you define a TAM in the markets that we are today, that's around 110 billion tons equivalent of physical that can trade. And today, in the marketplaces that were strong, we traded 18 billion tons. So we've hit about 16% of that TAM. And obviously, with that, there is a long runway to go in the geographies where we're strong today. And what will help feed that growth is more sectors of the economy coming in and trading these products as well as voluntarily more companies that are measuring their Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions coming in and also trading in those geographies. That adds more participants, adds more sectors of the economy and will lead to more transactions going on in the derivatives markets. The other obvious area of growth is just more geographies around the world and global programs, if they do come in place will increase the size of that physical market. But given that we represent around 95% of the world's trading that happen on our venues, we think we're very, very well-positioned to capture that growth opportunity and that TAM that I just outlined. Alex, this is Ben. So when you look at that macro environment and again, Warren used that composite estimate of around \u2013 a backdrop of the business being down \u2013 or sorry, not the business, but the overall transaction volumes being down 30%. When I look at our strategy for this business in each of the segments that we have in this business, we are executing very, very well. And what's the evidence to that? Look at each of the segments underneath there. So despite that volume decline, our data and analytics business grew year-over-year. And we've talked on a number of these calls on how we see that playing out over time, and that will continue to be a growth driver as more of our customers adopt automation. We also have our closing line item that's grown year-over-year as we've invested a lot in \u2013 did a lot of brand-new innovations that the industry has not seen before over this past year. And as customers ramp on those, we're starting to see some substantial ramp-up on that, and that's leading to growth in that line item year-over-year. And on the origination line item, we way outperformed what industry transaction volumes were. And underneath the covers there, it's an explicit move towards more and more subscription. So we feel great about how the business is executing despite this near-term drop in volumes. It's hard to predict how long those \u2013 the drop in volumes will play out, but we feel good on our ability to grow this business and to outperform the industry backdrop based on our strategy in each one of those. And remember, on the \u2013 we just started that pilot program that was last year in terms of as every customer renews for a small percentage of them, we are shifting the revenue more and more towards subscription, and roughly 20% renew in a given year. And this year, we've really codified a program to hit a much larger percentage. We have a long runway, I mean, doing the math. We have a long runway to execute that over many, many years that we believe we'll continue to lead to growth in that subscription line item. Yes. Okay. Thanks, Brian. So on that 110 billion tons of physical equivalent traded, yes. The estimate I used there, so that's again just based on the geographies where we are now. So that's North America, EU and UK and putting a 10x multiple on that. And as you picked up there and the way you asked the question, that's as markets are maturing, we see it can get to 10% but even order of magnitude more than that. If you take very well-established benchmarks, it can be 2, 3x that easily. So we see this as a market that as it matures can get bigger than that. So I see that as more of kind of a near to medium-term TAM that can be achieved in that environmental markets. But then also as more geographies get added around the world and as more of the overall $50 billion \u2013 sorry, 50 billion tons of carbon emissions that are happening around the world as more of that adds more programs, as more governments around the world add programs, we have an opportunity to go after that as well. So there's an acceleration that could happen on that over time. On the nat gas, you pointed out, environmental is at 10%, natural gas also continuing to grow. Our natural gas business is really the only global gas business around the world. Our TTF business continues to grow on top of growth. So you've seen that continue to compound and customers coming to us around the world to manage their risk and using natural gas as the cleanest of the fossil fuels to help with this energy transition. And with the backdrop of industry estimates saying that energy demand is likely to double between now and 2050, we see that, that's going to be an important element in this transition towards a cleaner environment. And that this transition is going to be bumpy. And we're pleased to see that our customers are coming to as much \u2013 coming to us as much as ever to manage the risk in that environment. Thanks, Kyle. Yes. So we do see this as temporary. If you look at Brent overall, open interest today is about 5% over last year. You got to remember last year was also another very volatile year, where we saw tremendous growth in that business. So you are looking at a compare that's difficult. But on top of that, we're still growing that business and growing that business nicely. In addition, in oil overall, we have had a lot of success working with many of the physical industry participants in some brand-new innovations and ways for them to help manage their risk in the oil markets. The example would be ICE Futures Abu Dhabi that we launched last year to help people hedge and come up with a market price for hedging Murban crude oil that's going to Asia. And then just within two weeks ago, we launched our new HOU contract, which is Midland WTI American Gulf Coast contract, where we were selected by the industry to come up with a better way to price Midland TI as it gets to the Gulf and is going overseas. And both of those contracts have seen tremendous amount of pickup in physical market participants supporting it in early days, and we see those as highly complementary to the overall Brent complex. So it's an area we're going to continue to invest. We do see the COVID environment and jurisdictions and geographies opening and closing, opening and closing, unfortunately, does create some gyrations in here. But overall, we feel great about the oil complex. Alex, I'll start on the mortgage side. I can give some color on the short-term interest rate transition as well. In terms of eClose, we're continuing to see that ramp. So we went to \u2013 we were at 76 customers last quarter and the last update here. We're now at 93. So we're continuing to see that pick up and ramp up. And we see as those customers ramp up, that's going to be yet another area that grows that closing line item on a year-over-year basis as that closing line item is going to be heavily transaction-oriented because a lot of the costs associated to closing fees actually go on to the end closing statement of the customer. So that is important to highlight that. And as we deliver more and more of these innovations and solutions, we are able to capture more revenue per loan, which is something that's important on that closing line item. On the subscription line item, so last year is when we started that pilot program, and we did a small percentage of what renewed. So if you take a ballpark of around 10% of the 20% that renewed, that's probably the right ZIP code of the number that we touched last year. And based on what we learned through that pilot program, we've now codified a program that's going to hit a much larger percentage of the 20% that are going to renew this year. So that gets you into the ballpark of what we have accomplished being a very small percentage and that we do have a long runway of being able to do this over multiple years ahead of us. Just from the overall short-term interest rate transition and what we're seeing in that marketplace, that transition went seamless for us in terms of the short sterling to SONIA transition. We've seen \u2013 we did have some trading volumes, some ARB trading volume that was trading short sterling versus SONIA. That obviously, when short sterling went away, came off. But when you look at the overall complex and this rising rate environment that we're in, in both the U.K. as well as the EU, the market overall is off to a great start in terms of both volumes as well as open interest. I'll hand it off to Warren to talk about RPC."

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions.  Please note, participants is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mary Caroline O'Neal, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMary Caroline O'Neal: Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2021 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived, and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2020 Form 10-K, third quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of Fixed Income and Data Services. I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks, MC. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.30, up 34% year-over-year, marking the best third quarter in our company's history. Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion, and on a pro forma basis, increased 11% versus last year, with all three of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth. Total transaction revenues grew 13%, while total recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $755 million, including $35 million related to Bakkt, which after successfully completing its merger with Victory Park recently began trading on the NYSE. Adjusting for Bakkt, third quarter operating expenses would have been $720 million, in the middle of our guidance range, while our adjusted operating margin would have been 60%, up over 100 basis points year-over-year. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be between $737 million to $747 million. Relative to the full year outlook provided on our second quarter call, the fourth quarter is now expected to include approximately $10 million related to the Bakkt's sub period and $10 million to $15 million of performance-related compensation as we expect to reward our employees for their contribution to the strong results we are once again on track to achieve in 2021. Record year-to-date free cash flow has totaled nearly $2 billion. These strong cash flows along with the divestment of our $1.2 billion stake in Coinbase has enabled us to reduce leverage to under 3.25 times at the end of September, nearly a full year ahead of schedule. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases, including up to $250 million in this year's fourth quarter. We anticipate updating you on our 2022 capital return plans early next year. In addition, we announced in October that we have agreed to sell our stake in Euroclear for \u20ac709 million, or approximately $820 million. We expect to determine the use of Euroclear proceeds as we approach closing, which we expect will be -- will occur in 2022. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter net revenues totaled $959 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 30% increase in our interest rate business and a 38% increase in our energy revenues, including 34% increase in our oil complex, a 73% increase in European natural gas revenues and a 72% increase in revenues related to global environmental products. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, is up 18% versus the end of last year, including 11% growth in energy and 28% growth across our financial futures and options complex. Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and NYSE listings increased 6% year-over-year, including 10% growth in our Listings business. This acceleration in growth was driven by an increasing number of operating company IPOs choosing the NYSE, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $330 million and $335 million. Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled $477 million, a 6% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 6% in the quarter. Within recurring revenues, our fixed income data and analytics business increased by 5% year-over-year, including another double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 9%, driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect that our recurring revenues will improve sequentially to a range of $415 million to $420 million, and that full year revenue growth will be approximately 6%, at the high end of our guidance range. Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. Despite a double-digit decline in industry origination volumes, our mortgage technology business grew 7% year-over-year and achieved record revenues of $366 million. While third quarter transaction revenues declined slightly, they were more than offset by a 33% growth in our recurring revenues, which at $143 million once again exceeded the high end of our guidance range and accounted for nearly 40% of total segment revenues. Our outperformance relative to industry trends continues to be driven by increased customer adoption of digital tools across the workflow. While these secular growth trends have been a clear tailwind for our recurring revenues, there is also opportunity to drive accelerating adoption across our transaction-based businesses, such as our Closing Solutions, where revenue increased by 30% in the third quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter guidance, we expect that recurring revenues will once again grow sequentially and be in a range of $147 million to $152 million. At the midpoint, this represents growth of approximately 25% year-over-year, which is on top of 20% growth achieved in last year's third quarter. In summary, we once again had strong contributions from each of our businesses and across the asset classes in which we operate. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also generated strong cash flows, reduced leverage to under 3.25 time, announced the divestment of our stake in Euroclear and successfully took back public on the NYSE. As we look to the end of the year into 2022, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and create value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Ben.\nBen Jackson: Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Our strong third quarter results were driven in part by interest rate volatility, global energy supply shortages and the continued adoption of our mortgage technology even amidst a decline in origination volumes. But more importantly, underpinning that performance are long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes in macroeconomic environments. And with data and technology at our core, we have strategically positioned the business to benefit from these tailwinds across our platform. In energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution to cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up approximately 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 12% on average over the past five years. With the rise of LNG, natural gas markets are becoming more global in nature. In our European gas benchmark, TTF is emerging as the global gas benchmark. Revenues in our TTF markets have grown 38% on average over the last five years, including 84% growth in the third quarter.  The supply shortages and price volatility that we saw in the third quarter are a peek into the future of what the energy transition could look like. Energy consumption is expected to double over the next 30 years, yet carbon emissions are expected to be reduced by half. This imbalance in supply and demand will introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which will drive greater demand for our risk management. Our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas and power markets provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate this evolution. Complementary addition to the risk management that our technology provides is our growing suite of associated data products. Leveraging our leading environmental markets, we built a suite of carbon indices, which allow global investors to access market-based carbon prices through a single investment instrument. And today, there are a growing number of ETFs benchmarking to our carbon indices and environmental markets. Turning now to fixed income. The electronification of fixed income is a data-driven trend. We recognized this in 2015 when we acquired IDC and continue to invest and innovate in data and technology to further enable this trend. Our leading evaluated prices provide critical price transparency for nearly 3 million securities daily. By combining our proprietary pricing data with our comprehensive reference data, we've built innovative tools and analytics that will facilitate the continued electronification and automation of the fixed income markets. Solutions like our continuous evaluated pricing, best execution and liquidity indicators, for example, provide pre-trade transparency needed to determine fair value. We also see the electronification of fixed income within the ETF ecosystem. Our quality pricing and reference data, combined with four years of history serves as the foundation of our growing index business. We not only offer benchmark indices, but also calculation services, analytics and the unique solutions like our custom indexes. By servicing the entire ETF ecosystem through data and technology, we've been able to grow our index business double-digits for the past four years. And finally, turning to our mortgage business. In the third quarter, we were once again able to grow our revenues even with industry volumes down double-digits. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. While we only recently began this transition, we've already seen strong client adoption. Another opportunity that we\u2019re executing on today is in our closing solutions. The demand for automation in the closing of a real estate transaction is increasing. We see this evidenced by the continued onboarding of new customers to our electronic closing room, and hybrid solution that we launched in the second quarter. This month, we further advanced the automation of our eClose solution, which can save lenders hundreds of dollars per loan by leveraging additional technology and automation by adding eNote and eVaults. Our comprehensive offering and the efficiencies that it delivers, positions us well to execute on what we believe to be a $1 billion opportunity. Within Data and Analytics, our AIQ solution leverages AI, machine learning and proprietary data from our origination platform to automate the steps in the loan manufacturing process. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. Today, only a fraction of mortgage technology customers take our AIQ solution, and we continue to have strong sales success cross-selling to existing customers even if they're not on our loan origination system, including one of the largest depositories in the US. And while still an early opportunity at under $100 million in revenue today, the efficiencies that our data analytics provide position us well to continue executing against what we think is a $4 billion opportunity. Flywheel effect that our leading technology and data provides combined with the cross-sell that our broad connectivity offers generates an array of opportunities for us to grow a business that at $1.4 billion today is only a fraction of the $10 billion opportunity. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Ben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. The third quarter extends our track record of growth. We once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share with strong growth from all business segments across asset classes, and amidst a dynamic macro environment. These results are a testament to the strength of our business model, positioning the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion, and which together make ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth. The diversity of our platform positions us to benefit not only from near-term cyclical events, but also longer-term secular growth trends. We've expanded into new asset classes, growing our addressable market and broadened our expertise, making our network significant and providing the opportunity to unlock additional growth by collaborating across businesses. We recently announced another new product from the collaboration between ICE Data Services and ICE Mortgage Technology, called the ICE Rate Lock Indices. Leveraging anonymized and aggregated data from ICE Mortgage Technologies leading origination platform, this suite of indices provides a more comprehensive, accurate and timely reflection of residential mortgage rates. Building on this innovation, like we've done in other asset classes, these indices provide an opportunity to create additional products like rich analytics and better pricing tools for lenders. The opportunity to turn raw, unstructured data into actionable insights abounds across our business. By taking alternative data sets and marrying them with our proprietary data, we've built solutions that offer unique insight into the market. Our climate analytics, for example, leverage our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk as a part of their overall investing and risk management processes. As ESG is increasingly becoming a component of investment portfolios, our technology and data expertise positions us well to deliver solutions that meet these evolving customer needs. We have strategically assembled a portfolio to drive growth across asset classes and macro environments, and part of this strategy is capturing value by thoughtfully repositioning businesses. This year alone, we harvested our gain in Coinbase, announced an agreement to do the same with our stake in Euroclear, and unlocked Bakkt via our New York Stock Exchange listing. These transactions expose billions of dollars in value creation and position us well to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for our future growth. It's collaborative efforts, innovative solutions and strategic capital allocation like this that have driven our growth for the past 20 years and which lay the foundation for continued growth well into the future. Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to the best third quarter in our company's history, topped only by our record quarter earlier this year. I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Dania, to conduct a question-and-answer session, which will run until 9: 30 Eastern Time.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session.  The first question we have is from Richard Repetto from Piper Sandler.\nRichard Repetto: Good morning, Jeff. Good morning, Warren. Can you hear me?\nJeff Sprecher: Yes, we can hear you clear.\nRichard Repetto: Sorry, So my one question, Jeff, is the Mortgage Technology business, I think, surprised a lot of people. And when you zone in the closing, and you addressed a fair amount of it in the prepared remarks. But I'm just trying to understand the Closing Solutions and what are the new tools and trying to get better insight. It looked like that segment of the mortgage tech grew 28% or $19 million in a market that, at least incrementally, gets -- seemed to get soft.\nJeff Sprecher: Yes. Let me ask Ben to address that since he manages that business for us.\nBen Jackson: Hi, Rich, thanks for the question. And -- in summary, when it's part of the thesis we had in doing the overall deal is that we saw a long-term secular trend here for people to want to automate and digitize the mortgage process, to continue to work on condensing the amount of time it takes to close on a real estate transaction. And if you look under the covers of that Closing Solutions business, this is a business that's going to be very transaction-oriented. A lot of the costs associated to it actually go on the actual closing statement of the client themselves. So you're going to see that this is one of the businesses that's going to be heavily transaction-oriented. And if you look at the components underneath it, they're really driving the growth. First part goes back to an acquisition we did a number of years ago, which is the Simplifile business. This is a business that electronic -- does the electronic recording at the county of all the closing documents associated to a real estate transaction. In this COVID environment we saw, a year ago, the number of documents that are being recorded in the counties moving more and more away from paper and towards digitization and using our rails to do so, and we continue to see that. So Simplifile is an input into that growth. The second component there is a business that we've talked about many times, which is a business called MERS. We have a new bundled service offering there that takes a number of bespoke services that we had within MERS. So the registration of the loan itself, the registration of an e-note, which we continue to see e-notes being adopted more and more through the industry, as well as lifetime servicing transfers, all being -- we bundled that all into one complete offering for our clients. And then the third area that we've talked about on prior calls is the launch of eClose, which was really enabled by the combination of the expertise we have with MERS, Simplifile and the Ellie Mae business. And we combined that origination network that Ellie Mae has with the settlement agent network that the Simplifile business has. We've launched our eClose offering in the second quarter. We've enhanced that offering with our own proprietary e-signing capabilities in the third quarter. And then just this month, we launched our own proprietary eNote as part of our loan origination document set, as well as eVault. And we're continuing to see customers adopt those solutions. I mentioned on the last call, we had 55 customers going through implementation. We now have 76 that are adopting it. And as that continues to ramp, I see that as another area that's going to continue to fuel growth in the closing line item, which is really enabling us to take a business that, 12 months ago, was a $200 million business to now if you look at the trailing 12 months, it's a $300 million business, continuing to go after that $1 billion TAM that we outlined.\nRichard Repetto: Thank you. Very helpful. And I don't want to jinx you, Jeff, but you get a lot of things going right at this time, it appears. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning. On Bakkt, that has had a good run here. And while ICE is a founder owner, my impression is Bakkt seems to be more of a financial than strategic investment at this point. I guess, maybe first, is that the correct view? And if so, what is the intent for that investment? And how do you see the utilization or investment of the proceeds given the significant value creation we've seen here, even in recent weeks?\nJeff Sprecher: Yes. Well, first of all, and I think -- we'd like to position ourselves where there are analog to digital conversions, and there's an analog-to-digital conversion going on in the wallet. When I was a kid, I had a carried around a leather wallet in my pocket, and children today may never own a leather wallet. And so that analog-to-digital conversion is something that we wanted to be a part of. I think we decided to create Bakkt as a separate brand and a separate entity because a lot of our investors seem to not see the coalescence of institutional and retail coming together. As access is increased through digital tools, and you can see it in the US equity markets, there's less distinction between a retail order and an institutional order, for example. And so that same convergence is happening across all businesses. And we were a little bit concerned that our investor base wouldn't appreciate that we could both be an institutional network provider and also a retail network provider. And so we decided to give the company a separate brand. And it was -- we just didn't feel like it was being appreciated inside of ICE and so we decided to give it a separate capital structure on the New York Stock Exchange. Other than that, Bakkt will be doing its own earnings calls now as a public company. I'm no longer on the board. And so I don't want to ever speak for the company, going forward. But I will tell you that we do believe there's value creation in analog-to-digital conversions, and we're trying to place value there around the business. And that's part of why I see us as being an all-weather name that can grow on top of growth. We're locked up in the company as part of the IPO. We actually invested additionally as part of the spin. And so we're very, very high on that company and want to give it every opportunity to demonstrate its value to the market.\nKen Worthington: Thanks. Great. Thanks very much.\nOperator: Thank you sir. The next question we have is from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank.\nBrian Bedell: Okay. Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. Just come back to the mortgage side and the third quarter performance there, again, exceptionally strong. I appreciate the answer to Rich's question on that. But if you -- if, Ben, you can talk about maybe parsing a little bit of the strong results between what you think are market share gains versus a lot of this initial traction of the products that you mentioned. And the take-up of those products in the third quarter is, obviously there's, headwinds on origination and repurchase and then refinance volumes. But should we be thinking of this third quarter as a pretty good base, especially in closing solutions to forecast from, on the transactional side?\nBen Jackson: Thanks, Brian. I'll try to go through some of the components of what we saw that drove that growth. And as we highlighted, the business grew double digits year-over-year -- or sorry -- so the business grew 7% year-over-year. And with the backdrop of a decline in industry volumes being up double-digit. We also grew the business 8% sequentially, if you look at it from second quarter to third quarter against a volume environment that industry estimates would have down double digits as well. And if you look at each of the line items of what's happening there, you'll see that we outperformed not only in the aggregate, but also in each line item, what that transaction -- what that overall transaction environment was. In the origination line item, what you see there that I outlined in the last quarter is that -- and it was in our prepared remarks again today, is that part of our customs doing the deal is that we could take certain parts of the revenue base here and move it more and more towards subscription and take some of the volatility out of it. And the origination line item is one in particular that we are doing that with. And we've only done that with a very small percentage of the customer base. The average client is a customer and is under contract for four to five years. And we just started this year with a small percentage of the client base. We've had a great pickup in customers being open to moving more towards subscription. So I see we have a long runway of that. The other thing that's going on in that origination line is we're continuing to add more customers we're gaining more market share  And as we implement those customers, those are new loans that are running through our system that we are getting some transaction volume that we never saw before, that's offsetting some of the headwinds that you'd see in that transaction environment. The second line item, data and analytics, it's the exact same story. We're taking a business -- so this is the automation of the underwrite process through our AI tools. This is a business that was almost 100% transaction. Under the covers, we've been moving it more and more towards subscription. We're going to continue to do so, and we're having incredible success cross-selling this to clients. It does take a little bit longer to implement customers on this solution because you're automating and deeply embedding your solutions into very complicated workflow in each of these businesses as you're automating underwriting processes. But we have a number of customers that are going live on the platform that we've sold. We continue to have great sales success. And we have a number continuing to go through implementation. So that's continuing to grow and offset any transaction issues you see there. And then on the Closing Solutions side, this is where I unpacked in the first question, a lot of the new innovation that we have, a lot of the changes that we made. Simplifile continues to gain market share really versus paper. Our eClose solutions, our brand-new innovation that the industry hasn't seen before, and each time a customer is subscribing to whether it's using our e-closing room, they're using our document set, they're using our e-closing room, they're using our document set, they're using our e-note, they're using our vault, they can use either a component of those services or all of them. And each time they do that, we're getting incremental revenue on every transaction that's using that. And it's all greenfield. And there's very little competition in this space because of the unique position we've been in to build all those.\nBrian Bedell: That\u2019s great color. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is from Kyle Voigt from KBW.\nKyle Voigt: Great. Thank you. Good morning. If I could just follow up actually on the past -- the last question. Just regarding the move to subscription on the origination side, specifically. You said a small amount of those customers have migrated to subscription. Can you help quantify that? Is that sub-10% of the customers or any numbers around that? And can you just talk about the pricing structure? Because I thought the recurring revenues on the origination side previously were really just fee minimums on volumes. But it sounds like maybe this is a bit different in terms of fee structure. So can you just kind of go over that and what the strategy is in terms of migrating these customers? Thank you.\nJeff Sprecher: So thanks, Kyle. So on the -- so on move to subscription to answer the first part of how much -- how many of the customers have we done it with, it's well less than 10%. So it's a very small percentage of the customer base that we've been able to do this with. As you can imagine, now is a good time to actually be engaging with customers to make this transition towards subscription. Because you're in a high-volume environment, customers are in this high-volume environment, they want to adopt more automation. They want to be able to continue to automate and be as efficient as possible against any other competition. So they're continuing to add on more and more of our services. So when we go and engage in clients in this negotiation, we are willing to forgo some transaction revenue. But we're not foregoing all of it. We're just making it very open in our algorithm around, hey, if we're going to shift some to subscription, we are willing to give up some transaction, which is mostly the success fees on those transactions that we get. But we also remember the other transaction element that we do get is on our network. So any time a loan is coming on to our network and ordering services from third parties for the automation that we're providing there, we're collecting a fee for providing that benefit along those rails and that fee will continue as it is today.\nKyle Voigt: And sorry, are those multiyear contracts with some sort of escalator in them? I'm just trying to understand the, I guess, the leverage as you continue to gain market share of origination volume, et cetera. I guess, are you taking away some of the upside by moving to subscription and just how do you view that balance? Thank you.\nJeff Sprecher: Sure. So as I mentioned earlier in the commentary, the average customers on four, five year agreements, that's not changing. So you can -- and we just started this. So we just started doing this, this year, and we only did it with a subset of the customers that were actually going through renewal to really see what we learned in going through that and testing that our hypothesis, now theory, was right, and we've proven that. So we have a long runway to do this, and continue to feed more subscription revenue growth over time. In terms of are we taking away some of the upside, the way I see it is we're taking away some of the volatility in that line item. And where our upside is, is there's still a ton of new innovation that we're introducing to the marketplace between the e-close offerings that we have, that we've launched, between the automation of the underwrite and all the analyzers that we've been talking about on prior calls that we've been introducing to the marketplace. This is all brand-new innovation that is going to continue to drive transaction revenue growth in parallel to reducing the volatility and risk in some of the line items that we have, like origination, data and analytics.\nKyle Voigt: It\u2019s very helpful. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. So I wanted to just talk about kind of capital allocation now that you've reached your targets. And resuming the buyback, was curious about kind of next year and kind of interim time period with the idea around M&A still being part of your strategy versus buybacks, and kind of the capital allocation priorities here in the near term, or kind of the next, kind of, start of next year as well?\nWarren Gardiner: Yeah. Thanks, Dan. It's Warren. So right. So yeah, at the end of the third quarter, we got to under 3.25 times. That was kind of our target to resume share buybacks that we set when we announced the Ellie Mae deal back in August of last year. And so we'll start about -- up to about $250 million this quarter. I think about that kind of being more of a partial buyback, because we do still need to get to three times eventually. And I think we're well on our way there. But -- so we'll do a bit of a balance, pay down of debt alongside these repurchases over the next quarter or so. But I think once -- thinking about next year, nothing's really changed in terms of capital return philosophy. I mean, it's the same -- it's going to be the same thing as pre-Ellie Mae where it's return -- all capital to shareholders that we don't need for investment or M&A to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. So I think you should expect us to be thinking about it that way. And the only thing really that has changed here is that we've continued to grow free cash flow organically and then, of course, added Ellie Mae, which as you obviously heard today and in the last couple of quarters seen that it's performing very well. So those would be the things that I'd be thinking about as you're kind of thinking about next year and capital return at the moment. Right now, we're kind of going through the 2022 budget process. So as we start to refine that, we'll be able to kind of give you guys a bit of an update in the next couple of quarters or so.\nDan Fannon: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is from Chris Allen from Compass Point.\nChris Allen: Hey, good morning, guys. I wonder if you get some more incremental color on the energy business. I appreciate the kind of long-term outlook. Maybe how you think about the business near term, the potential for the current environment to persist? Any color just in terms of the health of the customer base, when you're seeing new customers coming in. And maybe just on the LNG global opportunity, where you're seeing the biggest sources of uptake from a regional perspective?\nJeff Sprecher: Thanks, Chris. So when you look at our energy business, and we've talked about this on several calls, one of the things I think that's come to light through this is that we are very different than any of the peers that are out there and that we've developed very deep liquid markets across the energy class spectrum. So whether it's coal, oil, gas, power, environmentals, we've invested heavily across that entire spectrum to give our customers the tools they need, to manage what we saw as a secular trend more than a decade ago of people moving towards cleaner fossil fuel such as natural gas, and towards environmental markets, carbon offset markets, compliance markets and the like. We made several acquisitions, climate exchange 10 years ago. We've been building out our global natural gas suite, and we have now a business that's substantially different than any of our peers. We continue to invest, as we talked about in prior quarters, our oil business, which is doing extraordinarily well with investments that we made in the launch of our Murban contract, that ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. We have a new contract in the Gulf Coast that's launching in the beginning of next year in partnership with several big physical players. And we're in the middle of a Brent consultation where Midland WTI may be added into the Brent basket. So you have a whole bunch of dynamics going on across this, and it's because customers know they need to manage their risk through this transition. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, I think the environment that you've just seen, you've got to peek into what it's going to be for a long, long time. This energy transition is going to be very volatile. Everyone sees the secular trend where investments are pouring into renewable projects and projects such as coal are not getting invested in. And the fact is any energy supply source, I don't care what it is, is susceptible to supply chain events, weather events, for example. If you have wind turbines and the wind is not blowing, it's not really easy to transition back to a coal-fired plant to get power back on the grid. So I foresee that we're in for a long ride of volatility. And now more than ever, the exchanges and the risk management tools that we provide are extraordinarily valuable to our clients, and it's important to us that we continue to engage with them as much as we ever have to continue to innovate.\nChris Allen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question we have is from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. \nAlex Blostein: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the question. I was hoping maybe we could zoom out for a second. You guys provided a lot of details around the new segments. But if you look at ICE today, 50% of revenues comes from sort of recurring sustainable business. It's grown at 10% for the last couple of quarters organically. And your guidance for Q4 implies about 10% growth as well. So maybe just walk us through how you think about sustainability of that recurring revenue base and the growth algorithm that we could think about here on a multiyear basis? Thanks.\nJeff Sprecher: Yes, it's a great question. And I think the one takeaway you should have is that, that has been an intentional evolution on behalf of the management team. We have been -- we started the company really being highly transaction-oriented, and have always wanted to have a bigger recurring growing base that we can rely on. Part of our thinking of becoming an all-weather name is finding these analog to digital market conversions, but also creating a portfolio of businesses that we operate that are durable in different environments. We really wanted to get into the mortgage space, and really worked for over 10 years to put ourselves in that space because it benefits from a low interest rate environment, generally speaking. We have other businesses like our interest rate futures and, to a certain degree, inflation-oriented products like commodities that tend to do better in high interest rate environments. And so, from a transaction standpoint, we wanted to be durable. We want to grow on top of growth and not be a name where people pile in when interest rates are going up and pile out when interest rates are going down. And so, the more that we feel like we can lock into growing and recurring revenue, it gives investors a basis to know that we're going to continue to pay a dividend, that we're going to have capital to reinvest in the business. And then, if we can have transaction businesses that, regardless of macro environment, can do well. It just feels like a company that an investor should own. And that has been the strategy that we've deployed here for -- I mean years now. And it's finally coming to fruition. And the mortgage business, as Ben has mentioned, we've passed our colleagues with let's try to -- to really build a durable subscription underpinning to a business that also has really interesting transaction opportunities because of changes in technology. And the same thing in emissions and in liquefied natural gas. I know you and I have talked for years about our thesis that the natural gas market would globalize and that there would be global benchmarks, not regional benchmarks. And so, a lot of these metrics that you see in your economic model have been incredibly intentional on our part over a long period of time. And it's great that in this quarter, as was mentioned earlier, everything came together at one time.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thank you. Operator: Thank you. The next question we have is from Alex Kramm from UBS.\nAlex Kramm: Yeah. Hey, good morning, everyone. Just one quick follow-up on the mortgage side again. A lot of good qualitative detail, but I think what's missing a little bit is some more quantitative updates here. And I guess I know you don't give us any sort of numbers of mortgages that go in through your system a quarter, and I know a lot of investors are asking for that. But in absence of that, given that you're talking about a kind of like upsell, revenue upsell, sorry, maybe you can at least help us how much your revenue per mortgage has been changing over the last year or two? I mean, again, like if you're upselling, I guess, that revenue per mortgage should go up. So maybe some numbers you can put around that. And if you can decompose a little bit between pricing and certain new services that would be very helpful, too. So hopefully, you can give us a little something here.\nJeff Sprecher: Yeah. Alex, there's a lot in that question. What I'll -- one area I can unpack here is when you dig into that, what's leading to our subscription growth. So that's one of the areas of our thesis is that we could move more and more towards subscription in certain parts of the business. And if you look at the components of what's fueling that, one is the very deliberate -- as customers are renewing, moving more and more towards subscription and the origination and the data and analytics line, that's one component. The second is new sales. And this is about market share gains. So we continue to have a lot of success in continuing to add new customers onto our platform and cross-selling services to our existing clients is really the third. So in that cross-selling, the way to think about it, there's opportunities for us to expand the footprint with our clients, with the existing services that they have. We have clients that are using us, for example, on the loan origination side and the correspondent channel, moving to add the retail channel onto that, adding services like our Maven compliance service or our AllRegs offering. All of those are heavily subscription oriented, so we have a concerted effort to cross-sell. And then the fourth is price. And our algorithm when we did the deal and our hypothesis is that on the subscription revenue growth, which is a big component of what we think is required to really hit that 8% to 10% long-term guide, that over that long period of time, each of those elements, the renewals, new sales, cross-selling and price, that will be pretty much an equal distribution across those three that you'll see over a long period of time is what's going to fuel that sustained subscription growth. So that's -- that's the area I'd highlight. There's -- on the transaction area, I mentioned a whole bunch of the new products that we're rolling out, which we believe has an opportunity to continue to grow transaction revenue as well and offset declines that you see in industry environments.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. But on a historical basis, the revenue per mortgage going through your system should be up, right? I mean just thematically or not? So to come back to the question.\nJeff Sprecher: Can you repeat the question? We didn't follow it.\nAlex Kramm: Sorry. But to come back to my original question, if I look at a historical basis, the revenue per mortgage growing the system should have gone up over the last year or so. I mean -- I assume, again, if you don't have any quantitative right, but like directionally, given that you're adding services should be up, correct? We're not looking at it like that.\nJeff Sprecher: We don't necessarily look at it like that. But anecdotally, I'd say yes.\nAlex Kramm: Okay. All right. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you.  That was our final question. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over back to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Danae. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to continuing to discuss our all-weather strategies with you as our world economy continues to evolve. And with that, I hope you have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. This conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks, MC. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.30, up 34% year-over-year, marking the best third quarter in our company's history. Net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion, and on a pro forma basis, increased 11% versus last year, with all three of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth. Total transaction revenues grew 13%, while total recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly half of our business, increased by 10%. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $755 million, including $35 million related to Bakkt, which after successfully completing its merger with Victory Park recently began trading on the NYSE. Adjusting for Bakkt, third quarter operating expenses would have been $720 million, in the middle of our guidance range, while our adjusted operating margin would have been 60%, up over 100 basis points year-over-year. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be between $737 million to $747 million. Relative to the full year outlook provided on our second quarter call, the fourth quarter is now expected to include approximately $10 million related to the Bakkt's sub period and $10 million to $15 million of performance-related compensation as we expect to reward our employees for their contribution to the strong results we are once again on track to achieve in 2021. Record year-to-date free cash flow has totaled nearly $2 billion. These strong cash flows along with the divestment of our $1.2 billion stake in Coinbase has enabled us to reduce leverage to under 3.25 times at the end of September, nearly a full year ahead of schedule. As a result, we expect to resume share repurchases, including up to $250 million in this year's fourth quarter. We anticipate updating you on our 2022 capital return plans early next year. In addition, we announced in October that we have agreed to sell our stake in Euroclear for \u20ac709 million, or approximately $820 million. We expect to determine the use of Euroclear proceeds as we approach closing, which we expect will be -- will occur in 2022. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter net revenues totaled $959 million, an increase of 16% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 30% increase in our interest rate business and a 38% increase in our energy revenues, including 34% increase in our oil complex, a 73% increase in European natural gas revenues and a 72% increase in revenues related to global environmental products. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, is up 18% versus the end of last year, including 11% growth in energy and 28% growth across our financial futures and options complex. Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and NYSE listings increased 6% year-over-year, including 10% growth in our Listings business. This acceleration in growth was driven by an increasing number of operating company IPOs choosing the NYSE, particularly in the technology and consumer sectors. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to be between $330 million and $335 million. Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled $477 million, a 6% increase versus a year ago. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for nearly 90% of segment revenues, also grew 6% in the quarter. Within recurring revenues, our fixed income data and analytics business increased by 5% year-over-year, including another double-digit growth in our index franchise, while other data and network services grew 9%, driven by continued customer demand for additional network capacity. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect that our recurring revenues will improve sequentially to a range of $415 million to $420 million, and that full year revenue growth will be approximately 6%, at the high end of our guidance range. Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. Despite a double-digit decline in industry origination volumes, our mortgage technology business grew 7% year-over-year and achieved record revenues of $366 million. While third quarter transaction revenues declined slightly, they were more than offset by a 33% growth in our recurring revenues, which at $143 million once again exceeded the high end of our guidance range and accounted for nearly 40% of total segment revenues. Our outperformance relative to industry trends continues to be driven by increased customer adoption of digital tools across the workflow. While these secular growth trends have been a clear tailwind for our recurring revenues, there is also opportunity to drive accelerating adoption across our transaction-based businesses, such as our Closing Solutions, where revenue increased by 30% in the third quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter guidance, we expect that recurring revenues will once again grow sequentially and be in a range of $147 million to $152 million. At the midpoint, this represents growth of approximately 25% year-over-year, which is on top of 20% growth achieved in last year's third quarter. In summary, we once again had strong contributions from each of our businesses and across the asset classes in which we operate. We delivered double-digit growth in revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also generated strong cash flows, reduced leverage to under 3.25 time, announced the divestment of our stake in Euroclear and successfully took back public on the NYSE. As we look to the end of the year into 2022, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and create value for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call over to Ben. Yeah. Thanks, Dan. It's Warren. So right. So yeah, at the end of the third quarter, we got to under 3.25 times. That was kind of our target to resume share buybacks that we set when we announced the Ellie Mae deal back in August of last year. And so we'll start about -- up to about $250 million this quarter. I think about that kind of being more of a partial buyback, because we do still need to get to three times eventually. And I think we're well on our way there. But -- so we'll do a bit of a balance, pay down of debt alongside these repurchases over the next quarter or so. But I think once -- thinking about next year, nothing's really changed in terms of capital return philosophy. I mean, it's the same -- it's going to be the same thing as pre-Ellie Mae where it's return -- all capital to shareholders that we don't need for investment or M&A to shareholders through buybacks and dividends.

            "name": "Jeff Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Ben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. The third quarter extends our track record of growth. We once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share with strong growth from all business segments across asset classes, and amidst a dynamic macro environment. These results are a testament to the strength of our business model, positioning the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog-to-digital conversion, and which together make ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth. The diversity of our platform positions us to benefit not only from near-term cyclical events, but also longer-term secular growth trends. We've expanded into new asset classes, growing our addressable market and broadened our expertise, making our network significant and providing the opportunity to unlock additional growth by collaborating across businesses. We recently announced another new product from the collaboration between ICE Data Services and ICE Mortgage Technology, called the ICE Rate Lock Indices. Leveraging anonymized and aggregated data from ICE Mortgage Technologies leading origination platform, this suite of indices provides a more comprehensive, accurate and timely reflection of residential mortgage rates. Building on this innovation, like we've done in other asset classes, these indices provide an opportunity to create additional products like rich analytics and better pricing tools for lenders. The opportunity to turn raw, unstructured data into actionable insights abounds across our business. By taking alternative data sets and marrying them with our proprietary data, we've built solutions that offer unique insight into the market. Our climate analytics, for example, leverage our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk as a part of their overall investing and risk management processes. As ESG is increasingly becoming a component of investment portfolios, our technology and data expertise positions us well to deliver solutions that meet these evolving customer needs. We have strategically assembled a portfolio to drive growth across asset classes and macro environments, and part of this strategy is capturing value by thoughtfully repositioning businesses. This year alone, we harvested our gain in Coinbase, announced an agreement to do the same with our stake in Euroclear, and unlocked Bakkt via our New York Stock Exchange listing. These transactions expose billions of dollars in value creation and position us well to return capital to shareholders while continuing to invest for our future growth. It's collaborative efforts, innovative solutions and strategic capital allocation like this that have driven our growth for the past 20 years and which lay the foundation for continued growth well into the future. Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to the best third quarter in our company's history, topped only by our record quarter earlier this year. I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Dania, to conduct a question-and-answer session, which will run until 9: 30 Eastern Time. Yes, we can hear you clear. Yes. Let me ask Ben to address that since he manages that business for us. Yes. Well, first of all, and I think -- we'd like to position ourselves where there are analog to digital conversions, and there's an analog-to-digital conversion going on in the wallet. When I was a kid, I had a carried around a leather wallet in my pocket, and children today may never own a leather wallet. And so that analog-to-digital conversion is something that we wanted to be a part of. I think we decided to create Bakkt as a separate brand and a separate entity because a lot of our investors seem to not see the coalescence of institutional and retail coming together. As access is increased through digital tools, and you can see it in the US equity markets, there's less distinction between a retail order and an institutional order, for example. And so that same convergence is happening across all businesses. And we were a little bit concerned that our investor base wouldn't appreciate that we could both be an institutional network provider and also a retail network provider. And so we decided to give the company a separate brand. And it was -- we just didn't feel like it was being appreciated inside of ICE and so we decided to give it a separate capital structure on the New York Stock Exchange. Other than that, Bakkt will be doing its own earnings calls now as a public company. I'm no longer on the board. And so I don't want to ever speak for the company, going forward. But I will tell you that we do believe there's value creation in analog-to-digital conversions, and we're trying to place value there around the business. And that's part of why I see us as being an all-weather name that can grow on top of growth. We're locked up in the company as part of the IPO. We actually invested additionally as part of the spin. And so we're very, very high on that company and want to give it every opportunity to demonstrate its value to the market. So thanks, Kyle. So on the -- so on move to subscription to answer the first part of how much -- how many of the customers have we done it with, it's well less than 10%. So it's a very small percentage of the customer base that we've been able to do this with. As you can imagine, now is a good time to actually be engaging with customers to make this transition towards subscription. Because you're in a high-volume environment, customers are in this high-volume environment, they want to adopt more automation. They want to be able to continue to automate and be as efficient as possible against any other competition. So they're continuing to add on more and more of our services. So when we go and engage in clients in this negotiation, we are willing to forgo some transaction revenue. But we're not foregoing all of it. We're just making it very open in our algorithm around, hey, if we're going to shift some to subscription, we are willing to give up some transaction, which is mostly the success fees on those transactions that we get. But we also remember the other transaction element that we do get is on our network. So any time a loan is coming on to our network and ordering services from third parties for the automation that we're providing there, we're collecting a fee for providing that benefit along those rails and that fee will continue as it is today. Sure. So as I mentioned earlier in the commentary, the average customers on four, five year agreements, that's not changing. So you can -- and we just started this. So we just started doing this, this year, and we only did it with a subset of the customers that were actually going through renewal to really see what we learned in going through that and testing that our hypothesis, now theory, was right, and we've proven that. So we have a long runway to do this, and continue to feed more subscription revenue growth over time. In terms of are we taking away some of the upside, the way I see it is we're taking away some of the volatility in that line item. And where our upside is, is there's still a ton of new innovation that we're introducing to the marketplace between the e-close offerings that we have, that we've launched, between the automation of the underwrite and all the analyzers that we've been talking about on prior calls that we've been introducing to the marketplace. This is all brand-new innovation that is going to continue to drive transaction revenue growth in parallel to reducing the volatility and risk in some of the line items that we have, like origination, data and analytics.

And if you look at the components of what's fueling that, one is the very deliberate -- as customers are renewing, moving more and more towards subscription and the origination and the data and analytics line, that's one component. The second is new sales. And this is about market share gains. So we continue to have a lot of success in continuing to add new customers onto our platform and cross-selling services to our existing clients is really the third. So in that cross-selling, the way to think about it, there's opportunities for us to expand the footprint with our clients, with the existing services that they have. We have clients that are using us, for example, on the loan origination side and the correspondent channel, moving to add the retail channel onto that, adding services like our Maven compliance service or our AllRegs offering. All of those are heavily subscription oriented, so we have a concerted effort to cross-sell. And then the fourth is price. And our algorithm when we did the deal and our hypothesis is that on the subscription revenue growth, which is a big component of what we think is required to really hit that 8% to 10% long-term guide, that over that long period of time, each of those elements, the renewals, new sales, cross-selling and price, that will be pretty much an equal distribution across those three that you'll see over a long period of time is what's going to fuel that sustained subscription growth. So that's -- that's the area I'd highlight. There's -- on the transaction area, I mentioned a whole bunch of the new products that we're rolling out, which we believe has an opportunity to continue to grow transaction revenue as well and offset declines that you see in industry environments. Can you repeat the question? We didn't follow it. We don't necessarily look at it like that. But anecdotally, I'd say yes. Thank you, Danae. And thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to continuing to discuss our all-weather strategies with you as our world economy continues to evolve. And with that, I hope you have a great day."

            "content": "Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Our strong third quarter results were driven in part by interest rate volatility, global energy supply shortages and the continued adoption of our mortgage technology even amidst a decline in origination volumes. But more importantly, underpinning that performance are long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes in macroeconomic environments. And with data and technology at our core, we have strategically positioned the business to benefit from these tailwinds across our platform. In energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution to cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up approximately 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 12% on average over the past five years. With the rise of LNG, natural gas markets are becoming more global in nature. In our European gas benchmark, TTF is emerging as the global gas benchmark. Revenues in our TTF markets have grown 38% on average over the last five years, including 84% growth in the third quarter.  The supply shortages and price volatility that we saw in the third quarter are a peek into the future of what the energy transition could look like. Energy consumption is expected to double over the next 30 years, yet carbon emissions are expected to be reduced by half. This imbalance in supply and demand will introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which will drive greater demand for our risk management. Our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas and power markets provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate this evolution. Complementary addition to the risk management that our technology provides is our growing suite of associated data products. Leveraging our leading environmental markets, we built a suite of carbon indices, which allow global investors to access market-based carbon prices through a single investment instrument. And today, there are a growing number of ETFs benchmarking to our carbon indices and environmental markets. Turning now to fixed income. The electronification of fixed income is a data-driven trend. We recognized this in 2015 when we acquired IDC and continue to invest and innovate in data and technology to further enable this trend. Our leading evaluated prices provide critical price transparency for nearly 3 million securities daily. By combining our proprietary pricing data with our comprehensive reference data, we've built innovative tools and analytics that will facilitate the continued electronification and automation of the fixed income markets. Solutions like our continuous evaluated pricing, best execution and liquidity indicators, for example, provide pre-trade transparency needed to determine fair value. We also see the electronification of fixed income within the ETF ecosystem. Our quality pricing and reference data, combined with four years of history serves as the foundation of our growing index business. We not only offer benchmark indices, but also calculation services, analytics and the unique solutions like our custom indexes. By servicing the entire ETF ecosystem through data and technology, we've been able to grow our index business double-digits for the past four years. And finally, turning to our mortgage business. In the third quarter, we were once again able to grow our revenues even with industry volumes down double-digits. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog-to-digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. While we only recently began this transition, we've already seen strong client adoption. Another opportunity that we're executing on today is in our closing solutions. The demand for automation in the closing of a real estate transaction is increasing. We see this evidenced by the continued onboarding of new customers to our electronic closing room, and hybrid solution that we launched in the second quarter. This month, we further advanced the automation of our eClose solution, which can save lenders hundreds of dollars per loan by leveraging additional technology and automation by adding eNote and eVaults. Our comprehensive offering and the efficiencies that it delivers, positions us well to execute on what we believe to be a $1 billion opportunity. Within Data and Analytics, our AIQ solution leverages AI, machine learning and proprietary data from our origination platform to automate the steps in the loan manufacturing process. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. Today, only a fraction of mortgage technology customers take our AIQ solution, and we continue to have strong sales success cross-selling to existing customers even if they're not on our loan origination system, including one of the largest depositories in the US. And while still an early opportunity at under $100 million in revenue today, the efficiencies that our data analytics provide position us well to continue executing against what we think is a $4 billion opportunity. Flywheel effect that our leading technology and data provides combined with the cross-sell that our broad connectivity offers generates an array of opportunities for us to grow a business that at $1.4 billion today is only a fraction of the $10 billion opportunity. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Hi, Rich, thanks for the question. And -- in summary, when it's part of the thesis we had in doing the overall deal is that we saw a long-term secular trend here for people to want to automate and digitize the mortgage process, to continue to work on condensing the amount of time it takes to close on a real estate transaction. And if you look under the covers of that Closing Solutions business, this is a business that's going to be very transaction-oriented. A lot of the costs associated to it actually go on the actual closing statement of the client themselves. So you're going to see that this is one of the businesses that's going to be heavily transaction-oriented. And if you look at the components underneath it, they're really driving the growth. First part goes back to an acquisition we did a number of years ago, which is the Simplifile business. This is a business that electronic -- does the electronic recording at the county of all the closing documents associated to a real estate transaction. In this COVID environment we saw, a year ago, the number of documents that are being recorded in the counties moving more and more away from paper and towards digitization and using our rails to do so, and we continue to see that. So Simplifile is an input into that growth. The second component there is a business that we've talked about many times, which is a business called MERS. We have a new bundled service offering there that takes a number of bespoke services that we had within MERS. So the registration of the loan itself, the registration of an e-note, which we continue to see e-notes being adopted more and more through the industry, as well as lifetime servicing transfers, all being -- we bundled that all into one complete offering for our clients. And then the third area that we've talked about on prior calls is the launch of eClose, which was really enabled by the combination of the expertise we have with MERS, Simplifile and the Ellie Mae business. And we combined that origination network that Ellie Mae has with the settlement agent network that the Simplifile business has. We've launched our eClose offering in the second quarter. We've enhanced that offering with our own proprietary e-signing capabilities in the third quarter. And then just this month, we launched our own proprietary eNote as part of our loan origination document set, as well as eVault. And we're continuing to see customers adopt those solutions. I mentioned on the last call, we had 55 customers going through implementation. We now have 76 that are adopting it. And as that continues to ramp, I see that as another area that's going to continue to fuel growth in the closing line item, which is really enabling us to take a business that, 12 months ago, was a $200 million business to now if you look at the trailing 12 months, it's a $300 million business, continuing to go after that $1 billion TAM that we outlined. Thanks, Brian. I'll try to go through some of the components of what we saw that drove that growth. And as we highlighted, the business grew double digits year-over-year -- or sorry -- so the business grew 7% year-over-year. And with the backdrop of a decline in industry volumes being up double-digit. We also grew the business 8% sequentially, if you look at it from second quarter to third quarter against a volume environment that industry estimates would have down double digits as well. And if you look at each of the line items of what's happening there, you'll see that we outperformed not only in the aggregate, but also in each line item, what that transaction -- what that overall transaction environment was. In the origination line item, what you see there that I outlined in the last quarter is that -- and it was in our prepared remarks again today, is that part of our customs doing the deal is that we could take certain parts of the revenue base here and move it more and more towards subscription and take some of the volatility out of it. And the origination line item is one in particular that we are doing that with. And we've only done that with a very small percentage of the customer base. The average client is a customer and is under contract for four to five years. And we just started this year with a small percentage of the client base. We've had a great pickup in customers being open to moving more towards subscription. So I see we have a long runway of that. The other thing that's going on in that origination line is we're continuing to add more customers we're gaining more market share  And as we implement those customers, those are new loans that are running through our system that we are getting some transaction volume that we never saw before, that's offsetting some of the headwinds that you'd see in that transaction environment. The second line item, data and analytics, it's the exact same story. We're taking a business -- so this is the automation of the underwrite process through our AI tools. This is a business that was almost 100% transaction. Under the covers, we've been moving it more and more towards subscription. We're going to continue to do so, and we're having incredible success cross-selling this to clients. It does take a little bit longer to implement customers on this solution because you're automating and deeply embedding your solutions into very complicated workflow in each of these businesses as you're automating underwriting processes. But we have a number of customers that are going live on the platform that we've sold. We continue to have great sales success. And we have a number continuing to go through implementation. So that's continuing to grow and offset any transaction issues you see there. And then on the Closing Solutions side, this is where I unpacked in the first question, a lot of the new innovation that we have, a lot of the changes that we made. Simplifile continues to gain market share really versus paper. Our eClose solutions, our brand-new innovation that the industry hasn't seen before, and each time a customer is subscribing to whether it's using our e-closing room, they're using our document set, they're using our e-closing room, they're using our document set, they're using our e-note, they're using our vault, they can use either a component of those services or all of them. And each time they do that, we're getting incremental revenue on every transaction that's using that. And it's all greenfield. And there's very little competition in this space because of the unique position we've been in to build all those."

Should you need assistance, please signal a conference specialist by pressing star then zero. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. To ask a question, you may press star then one on your touchtone phone. To withdraw your question, please press star then two.\nMary Caroline O\u2019Neal: Good morning. ICE\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of theice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today\u2019s call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions, and uncertainties. Please refer to our 2020 Form 10-K, second quarter Form 10-Q, and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You\u2019ll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP term in the earnings materials.  When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share.  Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chairman and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of Fixed Income and Data Services. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks MC. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.16, up 12% year-over-year. Net revenues totaled $1.7 billion and on a pro forma basis were up 4% versus last year. While total transaction revenues declined slightly, our recurring revenues which now represent over half of our business, increased by 10% with all three of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth.  Adjusted operating expense totaled $744 million. Our investment in Bakkt contributed approximately $36 million to second quarter expenses and were offset by approximately $9 million of net revenues. We now anticipate that Bakkt\u2019s announced transaction with Victory Park will close in the third quarter.  Looking to the second half, we expect third quarter adjusted operating expense to be in the range of $770 million to $780 million, including $55 million related to Bakkt which we expect will be offset by $12 million of net revenue. Incorporating third quarter Bakkt expense into our full year guide, we now expect 2021 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.95 billion to $2.98 billion.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thank you Warren, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 8. In the second quarter, interest rate volatility, global economic reopening, and the continued evolution of energy markets once again drove customers to our deep liquid markets to manage their risk. This resulted in open interest records across the platform, and through July open interest continues to build, increasing 9% versus last year and reaching a new record for our total futures complex this week. Greenhouse gas emissions and the evolution of energy markets are becoming increasingly important to market participants around the world, as evidenced by the 40% growth in the number of customers in our global environmental markets since 2016. Volumes in those markets also continue to grow, up 27% in second quarter and up 22% per year on average over the past five years. \nLynn Martin: Thank you Ben, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 10. Data is a core competency at ICE. Whether it\u2019s by-product of our exchanges, evaluated prices for fixed income securities, indices and front office tools, or data and analytics used across the mortgage workflow, data connects the different businesses across the ICE platform and connects ICE to participants across asset classes and around the world. Our comprehensive fixed income data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth as these markets automate and as passive investing grows. Our quality evaluated prices provide mission critical transparency for nearly 3 million securities per day. Combined with our comprehensive reference data offering, these form the building blocks to index construction and product development. The accelerating growth of passive investing and the efforts we\u2019ve made to increase the breadth of our offerings and flexibility of our approach to index construction has contributed to the double digit annual growth in our index business since we acquired the Bank of America Merrill Lynch franchise in 2017. A key driver of that growth has been an increase in the passive ETF AUM benchmark to our indices, growing to over $300 billion from less than $100 billion in 2017.  Part of that growth is being driven by established ETFs transitioning their benchmarks to ICE, including $60 billion of AUM that has announced the transition during 2021 to date. ICE data indices now represents just under 20% of the growing fixed income ETF universe, including over 50% of the muni ETF universe. Additionally, over the last year ICE has launched over 250 new indices across fixed income, equities and commodities, including a growing number of ESG and thematic indices as well as custom indices. Our new index customization platform gives investors direct access to the tools they need to build and quickly back test their own index rules, and through the first half of 2021 customers have created nearly as many custom indices as were created in all of 2020. Our index business is an important part of our broader front office toolkit which also includes solutions like continuous evaluated pricing, best execution, liquidity indicators, and real time curves. These front office tools have grown double digits for the past three year and continue to be an important part of our overall fixed income strategy.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Thank you Lynn, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 11. At the heart of our strategy at ICE is our data, technology, and network expertise which connects the different businesses across ICE, enabling us to deliver innovative solutions for our customers. In our index business, as Lynn mentioned, we\u2019ve seen a fair number of exchange traded funds transition their benchmarks to ICE. In addition to the quality of our underlying pricing and reference data, another driver of these moves is the expansion of the reference data constituents that we offer.  Assets under management transitioning to our indices not only benefits our fixed income and data services business, but we\u2019ve seen the cross-selling benefit to our listings business with several biotech companies selecting the New York Stock Exchange as their listing venue. Additionally, by combining our expertise in index construction with our leading global environmental trading markets, we\u2019ve created the ICE Global Carbon Index, a benchmark for the universal price of carbon which is critical to employing market forces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost effective manner. The ICE Global Carbon Index is part of a suite of environmental, social and governance related services that ICE offers to our customers, which also include green bond indices, climate analytics, and our ESG reference data. Earlier this week, we announced the integration of ICE mortgage technologies\u2019 transaction-based mortgage rates into our mortgage prepayment model at ICE Data. As a leading provider of price evaluations for mortgage backed securities, this is an important new offering and it represents the first time that we\u2019ve coupled the valuable underlying content from ICE mortgage technology with our expertise in identifying and creating new data offerings. This enhancement will enable the market to more accurately price mortgage prepayments, which are a critical component for fixed income investors. These are only a few of the many innovative solutions that we\u2019re able to bring to our customers as a result of the synergistic relationships that exist across our platform, which makes the whole of ICE greater than the sum of its parts.  Looking at the first half of this year, amidst the backdrop of rising interest rates and rising commodity prices yet lower equity market volatility and mortgage refinance volumes, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income, and grew adjusted earnings per share. These results are a testament to the strategy that we\u2019ve operated for the past 20 years, the business model that we\u2019ve intentionally built, and the value of our strategic capital allocation. We\u2019ve deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues to give investors upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. We target markets where there is an analog to digital conversion taking place. We diversify our global footprint because at all times, somewhere in the world, there are risks that our customers and our potential customers need to manage. We strategically deploy our capital, both into and out of opportunities to maximize shareholder value. The combination of these factors is what makes ICE and all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth. Before I end my prepared remarks, I\u2019d like to say thank you to our customers for their business and for their trust in this quarter, and I\u2019d like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to both the best second quarter and the best first half in our company\u2019s history. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to our moderator, Shawn, and we\u2019ll conduct a question and answer session until 9:30 Eastern time.\nOperator:  The first question today will come from Rich Repeto with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRich Repeto: Yes, good morning Jeff, good morning Warren, good morning team.  My first question is on the mortgage business. Just trying to see if we can get some more clarification on how--when the interest rate environment changes, how it\u2019s going to impact the mortgage business, especially in the back half of the year. If you look, you know, you held up pretty well versus what the industry forecast, but how should we think about when the forecast of over 20% or 20% down quarter to quarter, Jeff and Warren?\nBenjamin Jackson: Hey Rich, it\u2019s Ben. I\u2019ll take this one.  As we\u2019ve talked about on the prior calls, what we\u2019re doing here is we\u2019re building a business that\u2019s going to be resilient to cyclical volume trends, and at the same time capitalizing on the secular trend of the overall analog to digital conversion and a long term guide of an 8% to 10% average annual growth in the business. What you see in our results is you saw--if you look at our top line revenue number and you compare that to where--you try to draw a consensus to where the estimates are between Fannie, Freddie, MBA, we beat those numbers and we beat those results of what happened sequentially quarter-over-quarter, and we also, as we pointed out in the script, significantly beat our subscription revenue guide. The couple things that are going on under the covers there is that, one, we\u2019re having incredible sales success, and when we sell new customers, that leads to new subscription revenue as we implement them; and then number two, we\u2019re looking at taking this unprecedented time of volumes that the industry\u2019s seen last year and this year to purposefully engage with our customers on opportunities to increase the amount of subscription revenue that we have and some of the services that we provide along our comprehensive network, such as our loan origination system and our data and analytics platform called AIQ. We are purposefully tilting relationships with new customers as well as when customers are renewing, looking at shifting more of the mix towards subscription. In terms of the volume trend that we\u2019re seeing, we\u2019re seeing a purchase market that\u2019s strong but it\u2019s tough on inventory, as is very well publicized, and we\u2019re seeing a refinance market where interest rates popped up in March and they\u2019ve come right back down, so we\u2019re still seeing a refinance market that\u2019s decent. What\u2019s really offsetting any headwinds that refinance has seen has been a significant amount of cash-out refi that is happening in the market, just given the amount of home price appreciation and people taking money off the table to do home improvements or pay off other debt. That\u2019s what\u2019s really happening under the covers.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Hey Rich, let me just make one more point to you. Part of the strategy that we have at ICE is to build a company that will grow on top of growth, and so we have really designed the company so that we have interest rate exposure in other parts of the business that drives revenue up, and so the goal here, and as you saw with interest rates picking up, our interest rate futures complex and some of the products around our fixed income complex did better, so part of the strategy with mortgage is to make sure that we\u2019ve bundled it with this all-weather opportunity that we have across the whole business. \nRich Repeto: Very helpful, Jeff and Ben. It sort of segues into my follow-up, and that would be on the fixed income side, on the data side it\u2019s clear the dominance you have, and then I guess the question is, will it ever--should we even focus on transaction revenue or is it--will it ever parlay on the transaction side all the data dominance that you\u2019ve established there?\nLynn Martin: Yes Rich, this is Lynn. Thanks so much for the question. Now that we\u2019ve brought the execution and data pieces together, and as the fixed income markets have increasingly electronified, given the assets that we have under the umbrella, I think we\u2019re uniquely positioned to not only help the industry automate their workflows but to benefit from that automation.  Last year, we launched a piece of technology which united our execution protocols, but more importantly united our data elements alongside those execution protocols, and as a result you\u2019re starting to see more and more activity through our portfolio trading which leverages our front office data assets. All of that provides a tailwind for us from a distribution perspective as well as from a demand perspective to continue to deliver on those double-digit compounding annual growth rates that I mentioned in my prepared remarks for our front office toolkit.\nRich Repeto: Got it, thanks Lynn. That\u2019s all my questions, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question today will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Great, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping to start with the energy business. ICE is seeing significant growth in the environmental product, as you mentioned in one of the slides, I guess emissions futures in particular. It\u2019s a pretty high capture rate product, so I was hoping to dig in a little more here. One, spend a few minutes on how this market is evolving and how do you expect the growth to progress here, and specifically I\u2019m looking to get a sense of what the revenue contribution there is today to ICE, what sort of changes you\u2019re seeing at the customer composition level here, so end customers versus financial players perhaps coming in, how is that evolving geographically, so right it\u2019s largely EU but perhaps U.K., U.S., Asia on the com, and then ultimately competition - again, high capture rate product, how sustainable do you think it ultimately will be?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks Alex, this is Ben. I\u2019ll take this one. As you can appreciate and we\u2019ve talked about in prior calls, we\u2019ve been thinking about the environmental impacts and how to create a market-based mechanism to price carbon for over a decade, and that really came to life when we bought the Climate Exchange over a decade ago. Fast forward to today, for futures and options that are out creating a market-based mechanism to price carbon, we\u2019re 95% of the futures and options marketplace that\u2019s doing that, so we have a tremendous presence around the world. It continues to be a very high growth business for us, and as I see it, will continue to be. Some of the drivers for that, I\u2019ll just touch upon some parts of the portfolio. If you look at our EU business, where we\u2019re the vast majority of trading that\u2019s happening there, we continue to see new participants coming in, both financial players and commercial players, because new sectors are being captured in government mandates around who needs to pay attention to a carbon price signal, and there is the potential that areas like marine, roads, and buildings all get captured going forward into this, so that\u2019s a potential tailwind for more people needing to pay attention to our markets. You also have in the EU the concept of free allowance thresholds, where if you\u2019re under a certain threshold, you don\u2019t need to necessarily pay attention to carbon price signals. There is momentum behind lowering those free allowance thresholds, which thus could capture some of the major heavy industrial sectors that are currently not captured there, so that again leads to more commercials coming into the marketplace. In the U.S., again we\u2019re a significant, very significant lead in our business there, and there the big trend is new states coming into the regional greenhouse gas initiative, so there\u2019s potential for more and more states coming into that, there\u2019s momentum behind that in some of these states, and that leads to more trading in our markets. You have--just recently I mentioned on the last call that we launched our new U.K. emissions trading scheme, so as a result of Brexit, one of the benefits we got is that the U.K. decided to set up their own emissions trading scheme, they selected us to do that, we launched it, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it\u2019s been a very, very successful launch.  Then you have new geographies around the world, so you have a trend within Asia Pacific where there\u2019s the potential for more and more adoption of these, and given the significant lead we have in creating these markets on behalf of governments and market participants to create that market-based pricing mechanism, we\u2019re heavily engaged in all of those conversations. Given that we are the most transparent way to price, put a market-based mechanism to price carbon, we\u2019ve also developed alongside our ICE fixed income and data services business a global carbon index, which is using the prices coming out of our marketplaces to create a very transparent way to look at both global as well as regional price trends within the carbon markets.\nWarren Gardiner: Hey Alex, it\u2019s Warren. Just to answer your question on this contribution to our revenues, volumes in that environmental complex, it\u2019s been about 2%, 3% of the energy volumes, but to your point, correctly, it\u2019s a higher capture rate, so revenues there are actually closer to about 10% of our energy revenues.\nAlex Blostein: Got it, great. Thanks.  Just as a follow-up, maybe a little bit of a bigger picture question for you guys, but the stock has obviously lagged and the multiple is now at a pretty meaningful discount to a number of your peer groups, and there\u2019s obviously a number of peer groups there, so across potentially all of them. I appreciate the point that ICE is looking to sell a stake in Euroclear, but are there opportunities to further prune the portfolio more aggressively, maybe selling businesses that are not meeting your growth thresholds in order to de-lever faster and maybe begin a more aggressive share repurchase plan?\nBenjamin Jackson: That\u2019s a great question. To a certain degree, that\u2019s what you saw us do. Our decision to sell our Coinbase stake was really about us being able to de-lever so that we could get back to a position where we can buy back shares, return capital to shareholders, which has you know has been our historical trend, so yes is the answer. We\u2019re always looking at our portfolio. I think in our industry, there\u2019s a lot of mergers and acquisitions that happen but very few of our peers really think about dispositions, and we do, as you know. We\u2019ve at one time owned the French, Dutch, Belgian, Portuguese stock exchange, we\u2019ve owned various analytic businesses, obviously we own some minority stakes in businesses, and so we\u2019re constantly thinking about our return on invested capital and how to best deploy it. As I think you are aware, we always look at our own view of the value of our shares, and to the extent that the best place for us to deploy capital is in returning it to shareholders via share buybacks, we aggressively do that.\nAlex Blostein: Great, thanks so much.\nOperator: As a reminder, if you would like to ask a question, please press star then one, and in the interests of time, if you would like to ask a question, please limit yourself to one question and if you have a follow-up, re-enter the queue. The next question will come from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Yes hey, good morning everyone. Just maybe on the index business, thanks for the--I think there are new disclosures in terms of the ASV there. I know it\u2019s small in the context of the company and the segment, and obviously small relative to a lot of the other bigger index players, but Lynn, can you maybe help us with the revenue model and how that business breaks down? Some of your competitors obviously help us with how much is driven by EPS and asset base fees, how much is data, which I know in fixed income is important, and maybe even some opportunities around derivatives trading which maybe could materialize over time, so just help us a little bit how that business breaks down and where you see most of the opportunities. Is it just a play on ETFs or are there other bigger opportunities that you can monetize in multiple ways?\nLynn Martin: Yes, thanks for the question, Alex. It\u2019s a great question. I think we see the opportunity for indices in multiple areas, particularly in fixed income. The indexation opportunity could be anywhere from acquiring our data, acquiring data subscriptions, allowing firms to make their own custom indices, giving us the opportunity to calculate those indices to provide intra-day snapshots for those indices or real-time versions of those indices, provide analytics, but also provide benchmarks. Obviously the ETFs that I mentioned in my prepared remarks that has selected us as their destination for transition business, selected us from a benchmarking perspective. But in fixed income, increasingly firms are also looking at our high quality underlying data, the fact that we\u2019re able to publish that data on a real-time basis which allows them to manage the real-time risks of the fixed income ETF market, so from our perspective we think there\u2019s opportunity across the spectrum, not just on the ETF AUM side but also on the underlying data side, as well as the services around it like our custom index tool.\nWarren Gardiner: Alex, it\u2019s Warren. In terms of the revenue mix, it\u2019s similar to what you\u2019re familiar with at peers in that it\u2019s a mix of the subscription fees and then asset-based fees that are based off of those ETFs. I think if you think about some of the growth that we\u2019ve seen there, it\u2019s been all of that, but I think the ETF side of that has been where we\u2019ve been leading in terms of the growth. Hopefully that helps you understand the mix a little bit more.\nOperator: The next question will come from Brian Bedell with Deutsch Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great, thanks. Good morning. Two questions. I\u2019ll get back in the queue for the second one, but just wanted to touch on energy - it\u2019s sort of a longer term question for either Ben or Jeff. As the market slowly transitions to cleaner energy and environmental products, how do you see that longer term transition playing out in your overall volumes versus your more traditional energy products, so this would be both for nat gas, clean energy, and the environmental suite. I appreciate, Warren, that you said the RPCs are much higher on the environmental side, so that sounds like it will be a smoother transition from a revenue perspective, but just to get your thoughts on how many years you think it would take for the environmental and clean energy suite to match the core energy franchise, if that\u2019s possible speculation to make?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks Brian, this is Ben. I\u2019ll take this one. When you think about our portfolio, and it was threaded through your question there, I think you appreciate the fact that we\u2019ve built the most diversified platform that there is on the planet to help customers really go through this energy transition. We provide products, everything from coal to oil to natural gas to LNG and to the environmental markets, and in all those sectors we are the lead provider of services, helping customers within each of those segments but then also as they\u2019re transitioning towards a cleaner environment and cleaner fuels, helping them along that journey to manage their exposure to price risk. We\u2019re seeing underneath--you know, each one of those segments, we\u2019re still seeing a lot of demand for new products. You take, for example, just what\u2019s happened in oil - we\u2019ve had a ton of innovation that\u2019s happened in oil to help the Middle East and Asia Pacific commercial customers, where we were selected to launch the Murban Crude Oil Contract to enable users to be able to have a better price mechanism for pricing Middle Eastern oil going to Asia. You have the recent development that we announced with the Midland WTI American Gulf Coast Crude Contract that\u2019s being launched with two huge commercial partners in Magellan and Enterprise. It\u2019ll be launched early next year to provide a much better way to price WTI Midland crude that\u2019s at Houston and not constrained by the infrastructure constraints that are in and around Cushing.  You also see--you may have seen a recent consultation came out in the industry by us as well as our partners in S&P Platts to look at further evolution of the Brent contract and adding new sources of crude, such as Johan Sverdrup, and very importantly the potential for WTI Midland-basis Houston to be added into the Brent complex, further solidifying that as the global index for oil. I went through it in the prior question, all of the things that we\u2019re doing in the environmental complex to grow that, and we have a significant lead in our global natural gas and LNG franchise, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that continues to grow year-over-year, so we feel we\u2019re very, very well positioned to help customers along this journey, and we\u2019ll continue to partner very closely with them to do so.\nOperator: The next question will come from Patrick O\u2019Shaughnessy with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Hey, good morning. While your listings revenues are growing, your growth rate has lagged that of your primary competitor. Can you speak to the current competitive dynamics in the listing space?\nJeffrey Sprecher: Sure. Well first of all, the New York Stock Exchange floor was closed for a significant period of time during COVID, so part of the allure and the marketing of the New York Stock Exchange is the opportunity to physically be in our building and ring the bell, so we\u2019re very, very happy that Stacey and that team there navigated very difficult conditions on COVID to run the entirety of the business, and we\u2019re really pleased now that the floor is open. I believe we\u2019re doing 17 IPOs this week, just to give you a sense of how we\u2019re doing now that the business is back running in its physical form. Beyond that, we continue to be the leader of large capital raising. There\u2019s a cost in looking for listings. You know, you can look at the revenue side, that you\u2019re pointing out, but there\u2019s a cost, there\u2019s a marketing cost and we\u2019re very disciplined about our return on investment capital and how we deploy capital, part of the theme, I think, of some of the things that we\u2019ve talked to you about on this call, and we don\u2019t pursue listing where we don\u2019t see that the ROIC is there for our shareholders, so some of it is calculated on our part and some of it is really that we\u2019ve been at a bit of a disadvantage until the floor and the business itself was able to be back at full occupancy.\nPatrick O\u2019Shaughnessy: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. Maybe if I can just touch on the credit trading market, there\u2019s been some thoughts that maybe you could really put the pieces together from IDC to the two retail trading businesses that you bought to ETF hub, and kind of build something for the institutional trading market within credit. Investors have obviously been focused on that because of electronification going in the market, which you\u2019ve been historically very good at doing electronifying markets.  I guess the question is really, is it too late, given the success of some of those competitors, to think about eventually launching something more towards institutional trading as being a material revenue driver for you, and why hasn\u2019t it been a bigger focus to launch in that market? We\u2019ve seen continued really strong revenue growth from some of your peers and even from some small players that weren\u2019t material three or four years ago in the market.\nLynn Martin: Yes, that\u2019s a great question - this is Lynn. Thanks for asking the question. We continue--as I mentioned earlier, now that we\u2019ve put the execution business in the same vertical as the data business, and you have the macro forces of the market continuing to electronify data and the transparency that data provides, particularly on a near real-time basis, is going to be a key driver of that electronification. We\u2019ve made investments since we acquired the two retail businesses that we did in uniting the technology associated with those businesses, and where you\u2019re starting to see the fruits of our labor in penetrating the institutional market is really the portfolio trading activity that you\u2019ve seen more meaningfully pick up, starting towards the end of Q4 last year and then throughout this year. That leverages our new technology, that leverages our data assets, and that\u2019s very much institutional driven, and we\u2019re seeing increasing demand for those services as portfolio auctions continue to make up a larger portion of the trace prints that go through every day. That\u2019s really where we see the opportunity and the start of the opportunity to bring together the technology that we\u2019ve built and the data assets that are continuing to deliver double-digit growth around the electronification of this asset class. \nOperator: The next question will come from Michael Cyprys with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask on the mortgage side, as you\u2019re digitizing mortgage workflows. Maybe you could just talk a little bit about how much of that is in the cloud and some of the vendors that you\u2019re using there, versus what you guys are in-sourcing. Then more longer term as you\u2019re looking out, what\u2019s the potential to migrate the mortgage workflows over to a block chain? What sort of opportunity is that, what would that entail, how easy of a lift or not would that be to that do that?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks Michael, this is Ben. The business has, even before we acquired it, has had a strategy for the loan origination side of the business to move more and more cloud-oriented, and that\u2019s one of the things that Jeff and I have mentioned on prior calls gave us conviction in doing the deal, is they had made some substantial investments that have moved the business to the cloud. If you look at other parts of our overall mortgage origination network, everything from the point of sale to the manufacturing process that I was just talking about, then all the way through to closing in the secondary, most of the aspects of that are cloud-oriented. We have a mix of some third party service providers that are providing some of the infrastructure in there, and we also have major data centers ourselves that are hosting pieces of this. Our strategy is definitely to move more and more in that direction. We already have moved for significant parts of the business to that, and it\u2019s an area that we\u2019re going to continue to invest. Quite frankly, it\u2019s one of the things that is leading to a lot of the success that we\u2019ve had in sales that I\u2019ve mentioned in the second half of last year and the first half of this year, exceeding our models, is that if you look across our entire mortgage ecosystem, we\u2019re providing a service somewhere along our network and our cloud-based network, we\u2019re providing at least a service to almost every single mortgage participant that\u2019s out there, so the ability to engage with them, show them the value we can provide on our network gives us a great platform to then go ahead and cross-sell other services, which is really fueling a lot of the additional growth that we\u2019ve seen.\nJeffrey Sprecher: I\u2019ll just mention on the block chain, one of the dilemmas, if you will, for the mortgage industry is that it\u2019s highly regulated and there\u2019s a tremendous amount of data required to write a mortgage, and that data for regulatory purposes does need to be stored for some period of time and be accessible to third parties to audit. Right now, probably the best--and a lot of that is still analog and paper-based and is moving digital, and we\u2019re driving much of that digital adoption. But right now, probably the best use of the block chain would just be to put a hash as to where those records are located to make it easier for third parties to know at all times where the records lie, as opposed to using the block chain to store those records, which still are in the early stages of moving to the cloud, as Ben said. \nOperator: The next question will come from Simon Clinch with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead.\nSimon Clinch: Hi guys, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just dig a little deeper on the recurring--well actually, for the mortgage technology business overall, the recurring revenue stream is performing really nicely, and I was wondering if you could talk about the market share you have on the loan origination side and how that feeds through to that recurring stream over time, but also how you\u2019re progressing along with your pipeline of additional services that you\u2019re going to be layering on top to increase that revenue per loan, that should help us sort of model this business over the next few years when we\u2019re looking at--on that kind of per-loan basis.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks for the question, Simon. This is Ben again. As I mentioned in the first question that was asked, we have--since acquiring the business have had a very concentrated effort on how do we focus on that recurring revenue stream, how do we look at that subscription base, and really start to, where we can in certain parts of the business, shift revenue more towards subscription, especially as you\u2019re in this high volume environment that we\u2019ve been in and it\u2019s a great time to do that, to shift it more towards subscription, and for some parts of the business less towards transaction. That\u2019s more oriented towards the loan origination side and that AIQ business, so in those two parts of the business, those are areas where we have had a concentrated effort of moving customers in that direction. To give you an example, at that AIQ business on the data and analytics side, it historically was 100% transaction oriented, and we have moved it very significantly towards subscription revenue, both for every new customer that comes on the platform as well as renewals that are coming on.  We are seeing--you know, to the answer of market share, we\u2019re seeing record sales continue. As I mentioned multiple times, the second half of last year was a record and Q1 and Q2 have exceeded our expectations - all that is continuing to gain market share for us and for the business. As we implement customers, that feeds into new subscription revenue, that feeds into part of the beat that we had this past quarter as well as shifting more of the mix towards subscription. The other side of it is there are certain parts of the business that are transaction oriented and we are continuing to innovate new solutions and new opportunities to capture new transactional revenue that\u2019s not happened before, even for us or for the industry. An example of that is I mentioned last quarter we\u2019d be launching our hybrid eClose - well, we\u2019ve gone ahead and launched that, so that\u2019s a complete digital closing room that interconnects the consumer to the lender to the settlement agent, so that all documents, all collaboration, all communication and the entire closing process can be done digitally. We just launched this, and we already have 55 customers out of our 2,000 in the implementation process. As those get implemented, that will be new transaction revenue that will be coming through to us, so that\u2019s another example. Another example that Jeff had mentioned in his prepared remarks is the interconnectivity that we see between data on the mortgage side of the business flowing through to our fixed income and data services business, where we\u2019re taking transaction data out of the mortgage side of our business to help enhance and improve our mortgage-backed securities prepayment and valuation models, where we are a leader in providing that and further enhancing those models with real transactional data that hasn\u2019t happened before.\nOperator: The next question will come from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead. \nAlex Kramm: Yes, thanks for letting me squeeze in a couple follow-ups here. Just on the mortgage side, two things, actually. One, on the cost side, appreciate that obviously you\u2019re building a business for the long term and you\u2019re shifting to more recurring, as you just mentioned, but clearly you\u2019ve seen the transactional side turn a little bit, so just wondering to what degree there are actually potential offsets that you\u2019re thinking about as maybe those transactional revenues come down. Is there something you can do on the expense side, or is that going to continue to grow as you invest? Then for Jeff, since you just--we talked about this interconnectivity between the different businesses, on the mortgage side, Joe at your mortgage industry conference a few months ago made an off-the-cuff remark that you\u2019re going to be working together closely and maybe there\u2019s room for mortgage trading down the line with your exchange business. Just wondering to what degree is this just a long term dream, or if there\u2019s actually something behind the scenes that you\u2019re already working on and what the opportunity set could be there. Thank you.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks Alex, it\u2019s Warren. I\u2019ll hit on your expense question quickly first. There is a degree of variable expenses within that business, but I think the way you want to be thinking about this is, look - this isn\u2019t about a second half refi environment, this is about a 10-year growth opportunity for us, where we think we can double revenues over the next 10 years or so, so we\u2019re going to invest through however that cycle plays out. If it does play out, we\u2019re going to be investing through it - that was part of the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year, where we said about $40 million to $45 million of incremental investment. I think you\u2019ll see that start to slowly step up as we move through the year, and that\u2019s going as planned. That\u2019s all part of the planned investments that we\u2019ve made and we\u2019ve communicated to you guys. But I think one point too just to make there on that as well is that one of the benefits here that Ellie Mae and ICE mortgage technology has as being part of the larger ICE platform is just the diversity that ICE brings to them. As Jeff said in his prepared remarks, it\u2019s an all-weather stock, and so as maybe a mortgage cycle plays out, you\u2019ve got other things in other areas of the business doing well, so it really gives us the ability to invest through those cycles, maybe where a standalone competitor or peer wouldn\u2019t be able to do that, and ultimately that puts us in a better place at the other end of things. Again, it\u2019s about a 10-year opportunity against a $10 billion TAM, where we\u2019re only about 10% of that today, so you should expect us to continue to invest in that business as we kind of move through the next couple quarters. \nJeffrey Sprecher: And regarding future ideas, Joe, who you mentioned, has joined our management committee, which also contains all the people that you\u2019ve heard from on this call, and we run the business collaboratively so that we can work on this interconnectivity. What you\u2019ve heard Ben talk about on this call is really hooking up what we would consider the cash market in a traditional market - you know, it\u2019s the origination market of actually producing a mortgage for a consumer, and for the first time now we\u2019ve announced that we\u2019re hooking that to the secondary market through Lynn\u2019s business of taking that data to help with mortgage-backed securities. Our sense is that the mortgage market, while it is regulated, is likely to continue to get more government attention as it becomes more transparent. It\u2019s largely for many people in government a mechanism for wealth creation in the sense of people building equity in a home. It\u2019s also interest rate sensitive, as a number of the questions have alluded to here, and there are maybe opportunities for government to influence or touch interest rates for certain segments of our society, and as the data and the transparency of where houses are being bought and refinanced and where wealth is being created, as that becomes more transparent, we really believe that the business is going to continue to evolve around government policy, and that is going to make its way, trickle its way into the secondary trading market. We will be uniquely positioned with data and information about the changes that are going on in the cash market to help influence that secondary market, and it does it mean we\u2019ll host one of those or use other assets? Potentially, that\u2019s part of why we wanted to get into this ecosystem, and it\u2019s part of our goal to build an all-weather company that will perform in every environment. \nOperator: This will conclude today\u2019s question and answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Well thank you, Shawn, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We\u2019ll look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to execute on these really interesting and exciting growth opportunities that we laid out for you today. Otherwise, I hope you\u2019ll have a great day. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation, and you may now disconnect. ",

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks MC. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.16, up 12% year-over-year. Net revenues totaled $1.7 billion and on a pro forma basis were up 4% versus last year. While total transaction revenues declined slightly, our recurring revenues which now represent over half of our business, increased by 10% with all three of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth.  Adjusted operating expense totaled $744 million. Our investment in Bakkt contributed approximately $36 million to second quarter expenses and were offset by approximately $9 million of net revenues. We now anticipate that Bakkt's announced transaction with Victory Park will close in the third quarter.  Looking to the second half, we expect third quarter adjusted operating expense to be in the range of $770 million to $780 million, including $55 million related to Bakkt which we expect will be offset by $12 million of net revenue. Incorporating third quarter Bakkt expense into our full year guide, we now expect 2021 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $2.95 billion to $2.98 billion. Hey Alex, it's Warren. Just to answer your question on this contribution to our revenues, volumes in that environmental complex, it's been about 2%, 3% of the energy volumes, but to your point, correctly, it's a higher capture rate, so revenues there are actually closer to about 10% of our energy revenues. Alex, it's Warren. In terms of the revenue mix, it's similar to what you're familiar with at peers in that it's a mix of the subscription fees and then asset-based fees that are based off of those ETFs. I think if you think about some of the growth that we've seen there, it's been all of that, but I think the ETF side of that has been where we've been leading in terms of the growth. Hopefully that helps you understand the mix a little bit more. Thanks Alex, it's Warren. I'll hit on your expense question quickly first. There is a degree of variable expenses within that business, but I think the way you want to be thinking about this is, look - this isn't about a second half refi environment, this is about a 10-year growth opportunity for us, where we think we can double revenues over the next 10 years or so, so we're going to invest through however that cycle plays out.

            "name": "Benjamin Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you Warren, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 8. In the second quarter, interest rate volatility, global economic reopening, and the continued evolution of energy markets once again drove customers to our deep liquid markets to manage their risk. This resulted in open interest records across the platform, and through July open interest continues to build, increasing 9% versus last year and reaching a new record for our total futures complex this week. Greenhouse gas emissions and the evolution of energy markets are becoming increasingly important to market participants around the world, as evidenced by the 40% growth in the number of customers in our global environmental markets since 2016. Volumes in those markets also continue to grow, up 27% in second quarter and up 22% per year on average over the past five years. Hey Rich, it's Ben. I'll take this one.  As we've talked about on the prior calls, what we're doing here is we're building a business that's going to be resilient to cyclical volume trends, and at the same time capitalizing on the secular trend of the overall analog to digital conversion and a long term guide of an 8% to 10% average annual growth in the business. What you see in our results is you saw--if you look at our top line revenue number and you compare that to where--you try to draw a consensus to where the estimates are between Fannie, Freddie, MBA, we beat those numbers and we beat those results of what happened sequentially quarter-over-quarter, and we also, as we pointed out in the script, significantly beat our subscription revenue guide. The couple things that are going on under the covers there is that, one, we're having incredible sales success, and when we sell new customers, that leads to new subscription revenue as we implement them; and then number two, we're looking at taking this unprecedented time of volumes that the industry's seen last year and this year to purposefully engage with our customers on opportunities to increase the amount of subscription revenue that we have and some of the services that we provide along our comprehensive network, such as our loan origination system and our data and analytics platform called AIQ. We are purposefully tilting relationships with new customers as well as when customers are renewing, looking at shifting more of the mix towards subscription. In terms of the volume trend that we're seeing, we're seeing a purchase market that's strong but it's tough on inventory, as is very well publicized, and we're seeing a refinance market where interest rates popped up in March and they've come right back down, so we're still seeing a refinance market that's decent. What's really offsetting any headwinds that refinance has seen has been a significant amount of cash-out refi that is happening in the market, just given the amount of home price appreciation and people taking money off the table to do home improvements or pay off other debt. That's what's really happening under the covers. Thanks Alex, this is Ben. I'll take this one. As you can appreciate and we've talked about in prior calls, we've been thinking about the environmental impacts and how to create a market-based mechanism to price carbon for over a decade, and that really came to life when we bought the Climate Exchange over a decade ago. Fast forward to today, for futures and options that are out creating a market-based mechanism to price carbon, we're 95% of the futures and options marketplace that's doing that, so we have a tremendous presence around the world. It continues to be a very high growth business for us, and as I see it, will continue to be. Some of the drivers for that, I'll just touch upon some parts of the portfolio. If you look at our EU business, where we're the vast majority of trading that's happening there, we continue to see new participants coming in, both financial players and commercial players, because new sectors are being captured in government mandates around who needs to pay attention to a carbon price signal, and there is the potential that areas like marine, roads, and buildings all get captured going forward into this, so that's a potential tailwind for more people needing to pay attention to our markets. You also have in the EU the concept of free allowance thresholds, where if you're under a certain threshold, you don't need to necessarily pay attention to carbon price signals. There is momentum behind lowering those free allowance thresholds, which thus could capture some of the major heavy industrial sectors that are currently not captured there, so that again leads to more commercials coming into the marketplace. In the U.S., again we're a significant, very significant lead in our business there, and there the big trend is new states coming into the regional greenhouse gas initiative, so there's potential for more and more states coming into that, there's momentum behind that in some of these states, and that leads to more trading in our markets. You have--just recently I mentioned on the last call that we launched our new U.K. emissions trading scheme, so as a result of Brexit, one of the benefits we got is that the U.K. decided to set up their own emissions trading scheme, they selected us to do that, we launched it, and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, it's been a very, very successful launch.  Then you have new geographies around the world, so you have a trend within Asia Pacific where there's the potential for more and more adoption of these, and given the significant lead we have in creating these markets on behalf of governments and market participants to create that market-based pricing mechanism, we're heavily engaged in all of those conversations. Given that we are the most transparent way to price, put a market-based mechanism to price carbon, we've also developed alongside our ICE fixed income and data services business a global carbon index, which is using the prices coming out of our marketplaces to create a very transparent way to look at both global as well as regional price trends within the carbon markets. That's a great question. To a certain degree, that's what you saw us do. Our decision to sell our Coinbase stake was really about us being able to de-lever so that we could get back to a position where we can buy back shares, return capital to shareholders, which has you know has been our historical trend, so yes is the answer. We're always looking at our portfolio. I think in our industry, there's a lot of mergers and acquisitions that happen but very few of our peers really think about dispositions, and we do, as you know. We've at one time owned the French, Dutch, Belgian, Portuguese stock exchange, we've owned various analytic businesses, obviously we own some minority stakes in businesses, and so we're constantly thinking about our return on invested capital and how to best deploy it. As I think you are aware, we always look at our own view of the value of our shares, and to the extent that the best place for us to deploy capital is in returning it to shareholders via share buybacks, we aggressively do that. Thanks Brian, this is Ben. I'll take this one. When you think about our portfolio, and it was threaded through your question there, I think you appreciate the fact that we've built the most diversified platform that there is on the planet to help customers really go through this energy transition. We provide products, everything from coal to oil to natural gas to LNG and to the environmental markets, and in all those sectors we are the lead provider of services, helping customers within each of those segments but then also as they're transitioning towards a cleaner environment and cleaner fuels, helping them along that journey to manage their exposure to price risk. We're seeing underneath--you know, each one of those segments, we're still seeing a lot of demand for new products. You take, for example, just what's happened in oil - we've had a ton of innovation that's happened in oil to help the Middle East and Asia Pacific commercial customers, where we were selected to launch the Murban Crude Oil Contract to enable users to be able to have a better price mechanism for pricing Middle Eastern oil going to Asia. You have the recent development that we announced with the Midland WTI American Gulf Coast Crude Contract that's being launched with two huge commercial partners in Magellan and Enterprise. It'll be launched early next year to provide a much better way to price WTI Midland crude that's at Houston and not constrained by the infrastructure constraints that are in and around Cushing.  You also see--you may have seen a recent consultation came out in the industry by us as well as our partners in S&P Platts to look at further evolution of the Brent contract and adding new sources of crude, such as Johan Sverdrup, and very importantly the potential for WTI Midland-basis Houston to be added into the Brent complex, further solidifying that as the global index for oil. I went through it in the prior question, all of the things that we're doing in the environmental complex to grow that, and we have a significant lead in our global natural gas and LNG franchise, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, that continues to grow year-over-year, so we feel we're very, very well positioned to help customers along this journey, and we'll continue to partner very closely with them to do so. Thanks Michael, this is Ben. The business has, even before we acquired it, has had a strategy for the loan origination side of the business to move more and more cloud-oriented, and that's one of the things that Jeff and I have mentioned on prior calls gave us conviction in doing the deal, is they had made some substantial investments that have moved the business to the cloud. If you look at other parts of our overall mortgage origination network, everything from the point of sale to the manufacturing process that I was just talking about, then all the way through to closing in the secondary, most of the aspects of that are cloud-oriented. We have a mix of some third party service providers that are providing some of the infrastructure in there, and we also have major data centers ourselves that are hosting pieces of this. Our strategy is definitely to move more and more in that direction. We already have moved for significant parts of the business to that, and it's an area that we're going to continue to invest. Quite frankly, it's one of the things that is leading to a lot of the success that we've had in sales that I've mentioned in the second half of last year and the first half of this year, exceeding our models, is that if you look across our entire mortgage ecosystem, we're providing a service somewhere along our network and our cloud-based network, we're providing at least a service to almost every single mortgage participant that's out there, so the ability to engage with them, show them the value we can provide on our network gives us a great platform to then go ahead and cross-sell other services, which is really fueling a lot of the additional growth that we've seen. Thanks for the question, Simon. This is Ben again. As I mentioned in the first question that was asked, we have--since acquiring the business have had a very concentrated effort on how do we focus on that recurring revenue stream, how do we look at that subscription base, and really start to, where we can in certain parts of the business, shift revenue more towards subscription, especially as you're in this high volume environment that we've been in and it's a great time to do that, to shift it more towards subscription, and for some parts of the business less towards transaction. That's more oriented towards the loan origination side and that AIQ business, so in those two parts of the business, those are areas where we have had a concentrated effort of moving customers in that direction. To give you an example, at that AIQ business on the data and analytics side, it historically was 100% transaction oriented, and we have moved it very significantly towards subscription revenue, both for every new customer that comes on the platform as well as renewals that are coming on.  We are seeing--you know, to the answer of market share, we're seeing record sales continue. As I mentioned multiple times, the second half of last year was a record and Q1 and Q2 have exceeded our expectations - all that is continuing to gain market share for us and for the business. As we implement customers, that feeds into new subscription revenue, that feeds into part of the beat that we had this past quarter as well as shifting more of the mix towards subscription. The other side of it is there are certain parts of the business that are transaction oriented and we are continuing to innovate new solutions and new opportunities to capture new transactional revenue that's not happened before, even for us or for the industry. An example of that is I mentioned last quarter we'd be launching our hybrid eClose - well, we've gone ahead and launched that, so that's a complete digital closing room that interconnects the consumer to the lender to the settlement agent, so that all documents, all collaboration, all communication and the entire closing process can be done digitally. We just launched this, and we already have 55 customers out of our 2,000 in the implementation process. As those get implemented, that will be new transaction revenue that will be coming through to us, so that's another example. Another example that Jeff had mentioned in his prepared remarks is the interconnectivity that we see between data on the mortgage side of the business flowing through to our fixed income and data services business, where we're taking transaction data out of the mortgage side of our business to help enhance and improve our mortgage-backed securities prepayment and valuation models, where we are a leader in providing that and further enhancing those models with real transactional data that hasn't happened before."

            "name": "Lynn Martin",
            "content": "Thank you Ben, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 10. Data is a core competency at ICE. Whether it's by-product of our exchanges, evaluated prices for fixed income securities, indices and front office tools, or data and analytics used across the mortgage workflow, data connects the different businesses across the ICE platform and connects ICE to participants across asset classes and around the world. Our comprehensive fixed income data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth as these markets automate and as passive investing grows. Our quality evaluated prices provide mission critical transparency for nearly 3 million securities per day. Combined with our comprehensive reference data offering, these form the building blocks to index construction and product development. The accelerating growth of passive investing and the efforts we've made to increase the breadth of our offerings and flexibility of our approach to index construction has contributed to the double digit annual growth in our index business since we acquired the Bank of America Merrill Lynch franchise in 2017. A key driver of that growth has been an increase in the passive ETF AUM benchmark to our indices, growing to over $300 billion from less than $100 billion in 2017.  Part of that growth is being driven by established ETFs transitioning their benchmarks to ICE, including $60 billion of AUM that has announced the transition during 2021 to date. ICE data indices now represents just under 20% of the growing fixed income ETF universe, including over 50% of the muni ETF universe. Additionally, over the last year ICE has launched over 250 new indices across fixed income, equities and commodities, including a growing number of ESG and thematic indices as well as custom indices. Our new index customization platform gives investors direct access to the tools they need to build and quickly back test their own index rules, and through the first half of 2021 customers have created nearly as many custom indices as were created in all of 2020. Our index business is an important part of our broader front office toolkit which also includes solutions like continuous evaluated pricing, best execution, liquidity indicators, and real time curves. These front office tools have grown double digits for the past three year and continue to be an important part of our overall fixed income strategy. Yes Rich, this is Lynn. Thanks so much for the question. Now that we've brought the execution and data pieces together, and as the fixed income markets have increasingly electronified, given the assets that we have under the umbrella, I think we're uniquely positioned to not only help the industry automate their workflows but to benefit from that automation.  Last year, we launched a piece of technology which united our execution protocols, but more importantly united our data elements alongside those execution protocols, and as a result you're starting to see more and more activity through our portfolio trading which leverages our front office data assets. All of that provides a tailwind for us from a distribution perspective as well as from a demand perspective to continue to deliver on those double-digit compounding annual growth rates that I mentioned in my prepared remarks for our front office toolkit. Yes, thanks for the question, Alex. It's a great question. I think we see the opportunity for indices in multiple areas, particularly in fixed income. The indexation opportunity could be anywhere from acquiring our data, acquiring data subscriptions, allowing firms to make their own custom indices, giving us the opportunity to calculate those indices to provide intra-day snapshots for those indices or real-time versions of those indices, provide analytics, but also provide benchmarks. Obviously the ETFs that I mentioned in my prepared remarks that has selected us as their destination for transition business, selected us from a benchmarking perspective. But in fixed income, increasingly firms are also looking at our high quality underlying data, the fact that we're able to publish that data on a real-time basis which allows them to manage the real-time risks of the fixed income ETF market, so from our perspective we think there's opportunity across the spectrum, not just on the ETF AUM side but also on the underlying data side, as well as the services around it like our custom index tool. Yes, that's a great question - this is Lynn. Thanks for asking the question. We continue--as I mentioned earlier, now that we've put the execution business in the same vertical as the data business, and you have the macro forces of the market continuing to electronify data and the transparency that data provides, particularly on a near real-time basis, is going to be a key driver of that electronification. We've made investments since we acquired the two retail businesses that we did in uniting the technology associated with those businesses, and where you're starting to see the fruits of our labor in penetrating the institutional market is really the portfolio trading activity that you've seen more meaningfully pick up, starting towards the end of Q4 last year and then throughout this year. That leverages our new technology, that leverages our data assets, and that's very much institutional driven, and we're seeing increasing demand for those services as portfolio auctions continue to make up a larger portion of the trace prints that go through every day. That's really where we see the opportunity and the start of the opportunity to bring together the technology that we've built and the data assets that are continuing to deliver double-digit growth around the electronification of this asset class."

            "name": "Jeffrey Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you Lynn, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 11. At the heart of our strategy at ICE is our data, technology, and network expertise which connects the different businesses across ICE, enabling us to deliver innovative solutions for our customers. In our index business, as Lynn mentioned, we've seen a fair number of exchange traded funds transition their benchmarks to ICE. In addition to the quality of our underlying pricing and reference data, another driver of these moves is the expansion of the reference data constituents that we offer.  Assets under management transitioning to our indices not only benefits our fixed income and data services business, but we've seen the cross-selling benefit to our listings business with several biotech companies selecting the New York Stock Exchange as their listing venue. Additionally, by combining our expertise in index construction with our leading global environmental trading markets, we've created the ICE Global Carbon Index, a benchmark for the universal price of carbon which is critical to employing market forces to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a cost effective manner. The ICE Global Carbon Index is part of a suite of environmental, social and governance related services that ICE offers to our customers, which also include green bond indices, climate analytics, and our ESG reference data. Earlier this week, we announced the integration of ICE mortgage technologies' transaction-based mortgage rates into our mortgage prepayment model at ICE Data. As a leading provider of price evaluations for mortgage backed securities, this is an important new offering and it represents the first time that we've coupled the valuable underlying content from ICE mortgage technology with our expertise in identifying and creating new data offerings. This enhancement will enable the market to more accurately price mortgage prepayments, which are a critical component for fixed income investors. These are only a few of the many innovative solutions that we're able to bring to our customers as a result of the synergistic relationships that exist across our platform, which makes the whole of ICE greater than the sum of its parts.  Looking at the first half of this year, amidst the backdrop of rising interest rates and rising commodity prices yet lower equity market volatility and mortgage refinance volumes, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income, and grew adjusted earnings per share. These results are a testament to the strategy that we've operated for the past 20 years, the business model that we've intentionally built, and the value of our strategic capital allocation. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues to give investors upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. We target markets where there is an analog to digital conversion taking place. We diversify our global footprint because at all times, somewhere in the world, there are risks that our customers and our potential customers need to manage. We strategically deploy our capital, both into and out of opportunities to maximize shareholder value. The combination of these factors is what makes ICE and all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth. Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to say thank you to our customers for their business and for their trust in this quarter, and I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to both the best second quarter and the best first half in our company's history. With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Shawn, and we'll conduct a question and answer session until 9:30 Eastern time. Hey Rich, let me just make one more point to you. Part of the strategy that we have at ICE is to build a company that will grow on top of growth, and so we have really designed the company so that we have interest rate exposure in other parts of the business that drives revenue up, and so the goal here, and as you saw with interest rates picking up, our interest rate futures complex and some of the products around our fixed income complex did better, so part of the strategy with mortgage is to make sure that we've bundled it with this all-weather opportunity that we have across the whole business. Sure. Well first of all, the New York Stock Exchange floor was closed for a significant period of time during COVID, so part of the allure and the marketing of the New York Stock Exchange is the opportunity to physically be in our building and ring the bell, so we're very, very happy that Stacey and that team there navigated very difficult conditions on COVID to run the entirety of the business, and we're really pleased now that the floor is open. I believe we're doing 17 IPOs this week, just to give you a sense of how we're doing now that the business is back running in its physical form. Beyond that, we continue to be the leader of large capital raising. There's a cost in looking for listings. You know, you can look at the revenue side, that you're pointing out, but there's a cost, there's a marketing cost and we're very disciplined about our return on investment capital and how we deploy capital, part of the theme, I think, of some of the things that we've talked to you about on this call, and we don't pursue listing where we don't see that the ROIC is there for our shareholders, so some of it is calculated on our part and some of it is really that we've been at a bit of a disadvantage until the floor and the business itself was able to be back at full occupancy. I'll just mention on the block chain, one of the dilemmas, if you will, for the mortgage industry is that it's highly regulated and there's a tremendous amount of data required to write a mortgage, and that data for regulatory purposes does need to be stored for some period of time and be accessible to third parties to audit. Right now, probably the best--and a lot of that is still analog and paper-based and is moving digital, and we're driving much of that digital adoption. But right now, probably the best use of the block chain would just be to put a hash as to where those records are located to make it easier for third parties to know at all times where the records lie, as opposed to using the block chain to store those records, which still are in the early stages of moving to the cloud, as Ben said. And regarding future ideas, Joe, who you mentioned, has joined our management committee, which also contains all the people that you've heard from on this call, and we run the business collaboratively so that we can work on this interconnectivity. What you've heard Ben talk about on this call is really hooking up what we would consider the cash market in a traditional market - you know, it's the origination market of actually producing a mortgage for a consumer, and for the first time now we've announced that we're hooking that to the secondary market through Lynn's business of taking that data to help with mortgage-backed securities. Our sense is that the mortgage market, while it is regulated, is likely to continue to get more government attention as it becomes more transparent. It's largely for many people in government a mechanism for wealth creation in the sense of people building equity in a home. It's also interest rate sensitive, as a number of the questions have alluded to here, and there are maybe opportunities for government to influence or touch interest rates for certain segments of our society, and as the data and the transparency of where houses are being bought and refinanced and where wealth is being created, as that becomes more transparent, we really believe that the business is going to continue to evolve around government policy, and that is going to make its way, trickle its way into the secondary trading market. We will be uniquely positioned with data and information about the changes that are going on in the cash market to help influence that secondary market, and it does it mean we'll host one of those or use other assets? Potentially, that's part of why we wanted to get into this ecosystem, and it's part of our goal to build an all-weather company that will perform in every environment. Well thank you, Shawn, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We'll look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to execute on these really interesting and exciting growth opportunities that we laid out for you today. Otherwise, I hope you'll have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the ICE First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast.  Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mary Caroline O'Neal, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMary Caroline O'Neal: Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2021 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements please refer to our 2020 Form 10-K, first quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC.\nScott Hill: Thanks, Mary Caroline. Congratulations on your new role, truly well deserved. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some key highlights from our first quarter results. First quarter revenues, operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were all the best in the history of our company. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 increased 7% compared to our previous record of $1.25, which we achieved in last year's first quarter. Record total first quarter revenues of $1.8 billion were up 4% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Total transaction revenues declined slightly versus an unprecedented backdrop a year ago. Importantly though, total recurring revenues, which represent about half our business, increased by 9% with all three of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth. First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $729 million, including $30 million related to Bakkt. Without the additional $7 million of Bakkt investments, we would have been toward the lower end of our original guidance. We expect that Bakkt's merger with Victory Park Spac will be completed toward the end of this quarter. We expect second quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $742 million to $752 million, including approximately $35 million of additional expense related to Bakkt. Incorporating the additional Bakkt expenses into our full year guidance as well as slightly higher-than-expected FX, which will be more than offset by higher revenues, we now expect full year adjusted expenses to be in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.93 billion.\nBen Jackson: Congratulations to you, Scott. Thank you, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 8. As we begin to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and the highly volatile environment we experienced in 2020. Our customers continue to rely on our global energy markets to navigate uncertainty and manage risk. And importantly, it's our network expertise and investment in technology that enables us to deliver innovative customer solutions and capture the growth opportunities provided by secular trends, such as the growing complexity of energy markets alongside the energy transition. In our oil markets, Brent crude serves as the cornerstone of a global network that includes key benchmarks such as WTI, Gasoil, RBOB Gas and most recently, Murban crude oil. By leveraging our global network, the launch of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, or IFAD, has enabled for the first time participants to come together and contribute to the price formation of Murban, an important benchmark for oil flowing through to Asia. In just its first month, Murban, along with related derivatives has traded over 150,000 contracts across 49 firms with growing open interest now over 45,000 lots making it one of the most successful futures launches in our industry's history.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Ben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn now to Slide 9. In the first quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share, delivering the best quarter in our company's history. And remarkably, we did this against last year's record-breaking volumes and volatility, which was largely driven by the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our results are a testament to the value of our data, technology and the strength of our strategic business model. The compounding growth of our subscription based services, combined with our diverse transaction-based businesses means that our growth is not tied to one economic cycle to one geography or to one asset class. Rather, it means growth on top of growth through all rate environments, across asset classes and around the world. Over the past 20 years, ICE has continually evolved to meet the needs of our customers and provide value for our stockholders. And for the past 14 years, I've had the privilege of working alongside Scott Hill as our growth story has unfolded. ICE has completed dozens of deals and made thousands of strategic decisions that have been rooted in the information and the quality metrics that were ingrained in our culture by Scott. Scott not only provided financial leadership for the company but he's played a vital role in providing strategic vision. He championed our unique culture, and he's mentored younger generations of leaders. And so I want to thank Scott for his contribution, for his dedication and for his leadership. And I want to wish him our best as he moves on to tackle the difficult life of branching in Texas. Scott will officially transition next month, and he'll remain an adviser and a mentor to ensure a smooth transition as Warren Gardner assumes the duties of CFO. Warren's has worked closely with Scott over the last 4 years and covered our sector as a senior research analyst for many years prior to this. Warren's knowledge of our business and our industry will help us to continue to build on the foundation that's been established by Scott, and continue a track record of growth. I also want to welcome MC as our new Investor Relations Head. Let me say thank you to our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I want to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to delivering the best quarter in our company's history. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to our moderator, Chad, to conduct the question-and-answer session, which will run until 9:30 Eastern time.\nOperator: Thank you.  And the first question will come from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. \nRich Repetto: Good morning, Jeff and Scott, and Scott, all the praise and comments are well deserved, so congratulations. My first question will be on the Mortgage segment. And I guess it's been on spot but you reclassified the line and you sort of explained that. But I'm trying to understand how you outgrew what looked like Dodd industry originations and when we look at those four lines now that are reclassified, which ones are recurring and which ones are transactional, so we can model it out. And then lastly, which will be more dependent on refi or purchase mortgages?\nBen Jackson: Thanks, Rich. This is Ben. And thanks for observing what we've seen in the marketplace in terms of a downturn in transaction volumes as I can confirm, we saw a downturn in closed loans on our encompass platform. When you look at Q1 closed loan volume versus Q4. And as our results are testament to, we were able to grow through it. And what I'd point to is what we said when we originally announced the deal back in September, in that we see, just like we saw in the commodities markets 2 decades ago, just like we've seen in the fixed income markets that the mortgage space is an industry that's going through a significant analog to digital transition. And we knew by combining the closing network that we have with the unique customer originator and investor network that Ellie Mae has that we can do something really special here for our customers in providing a digital future and a lot of efficiencies. And that's how we got conviction that we can grow through long-term cycles. And that's how we put out a guide, a 10-year guide of roughly doubling revenue when you look at that 8% to 10% guide over a 10-year period. That's roughly doubling revenue. And what we've seen in the platform has done nothing but strengthen our conviction over the last 8 months in our ability to do that. Last quarter, I mentioned that Q3 and Q4 sales expectations well exceeded our model. That we put together last summer when we did the deal. And Q1 continued this trend. And what we get \u2013 tactically, what you get when you're increasing your penetration into new sales, you're getting new subscription revenue when you implement and then as you ramp the customers up, you're getting more loans that you're interacting with is you're never interacting with before. Those loans than interactive services are our network. So you have a flywheel effect, you have a compounding effect. But I think more importantly, this is what I was trying to get through in the script, is that when a customer is choosing our solution set, they're choosing to fundamentally change their business. They're fundamentally choosing to remove manual processing and adopt digital ways to automate. And when they select us, they're selecting us to be the heart and lungs there. To be their network that's interconnecting them to every player that we interact with from our front-to-back network. And as they realize those benefits from being part of our ecosystem, it enables us to cross-sell our other services that I also mentioned in the script, such as our AIQ offering, which is that automation of the underwrite, as well as eClose. So that's what gives us conviction on the ability to grow this business sequentially, quarter-over-quarter on subscription revenue growth and to grow through downturns or to outperform downturns in terms of volumes just as we did Q1 versus Q4.\nWarren Gardiner: And \u2013 hey Rich, this is Warren. I'll just try to give you a little bit of color on the subscription versus transaction breakdown. Most of the subscription revenue is going to be in that origination technology line. And within that, it\u2019s pretty balanced between subscription and transaction. The other part of subscription is going to be in data and analytics. And then when you think about transaction side of that, it\u2019s going to be the closing \u2013 that\u2019s pretty closing solutions, that\u2019s pretty much 100% transaction and then others transaction as well. And so hopefully, that helps you a little bit in terms of color, but we haven\u2019t broken those out quite yet, so...\nRich Repetto: Got it. It\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Mike Carrier with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nMike Carrier: Good morning and thanks for taking the question. Maybe just on the capital front, given the Coinbase gain you expected in 2Q. Just wanted to get an update on how you guys are prioritizing your debt pay-down if you expect to get your target leverage faster? And then any other investment areas for growth in the business?\nWarren Gardiner: Yes. Mike, it\u2019s Warren again. So yes, we are definitely a bit ahead of schedule, been paying down debt faster than we sort of expected when we started the deal. I mean I would say we were doing that, though, before the Coinbase sale. You look at the quarter, we generated about 300 and \u2013 $734 million of cash flow. We used that to pay down a little \u2013 or close to $350 million of debt, raised our dividend by 10%, and then also invest in the business. So, I think when you think about this Coinbase proceeds, that\u2019s really \u2013 that gives us some additional flexibility as we kind of move into the rest of the year. And as Scott said, we are down to about 3.6 leverage, the target is about 3.25, where we can start to think about buying back stock, but again, as Scott said \u2013 but again, this is just giving us a little bit of flexibility, and we will give you guys kind of more of an update as we get a bit closer to that in terms of what we will do with buybacks.\nMike Carrier: Great. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: The next question is from Ken Hill with Loop Capital. Please go ahead.\nKen Hill: Hi, good morning everyone. So, I wanted to start with ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. I know you guys had a really strong start with the Murban crude contract. You talked about some of the records. Ben, I think in the prepared remarks, you talked about being one of the most successful launches there. I was hoping you could maybe outline a little bit on the broader ambitions in regions there, whether it\u2019s Middle East or Asia, how you might be leveraging that success there and thinking about kind of like a land and expand type of opportunity in other ICE products, whether that\u2019s on the trading side or on the data side? How should we be thinking about that in those regions there? Thanks.\nBen Jackson: Thanks for the question, Ken. It\u2019s Ben. And when you look at our futures markets and how we have developed them versus any of our peers, we have been stayed very close to the commercial customer base since our inception. And that\u2019s what\u2019s enabled us to develop literally hundreds of oil contracts around the world because it helps our customers not only manage the risk in a benchmark contract, but also help them manage their risk at the point of consumption or the point of production of where they have real risk. And we are the only truly global platform that enables customers with deep liquid markets in hundreds of marketplaces to be able to manage that risk. And with the backdrop of COVID going on the past year, we didn\u2019t stop moving. We continued to partner with our commercial customers around the world, and that\u2019s what led to the launch of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, just in the last few weeks here. And in the early days, it looks like one of it to be \u2013 one of the most successful futures launches in history. And what I would point to with that is not only the volume growth, but also the \u2013 importantly, the significant open interest growth and the fact that there is 49 major players that are in there utilizing the contracts, establishing positions to manage risk. And I look at that compared to other parts of our oil business, that across the board are doing very well. If you compare our overall oil open interest right now in April versus the fourth quarter, we are up in almost every major product category. You compare April oil open interest versus April 2019, we are up in almost every category. If you look at under the covers from a year-over-year basis, while there is some tough compares, in there. We have significant product sets, such as our Asia Refined products set, gas oil in Dubai that are up year-over-year. So, we believe we have a great foundation. We have already been in Asia, have a number of significant products out there that enabled customers to hedge and manage risk. And we are going to stay very close to our commercial customer base to look for more opportunities to do so.\nJeff Sprecher: And this is Jeff. I think we \u2013 to get a little more embellishment, we have launched, I believe, now a dozen derivative contracts on that exchange. So we are moving quickly, if you will, to build out a broader product suite there. And one of the things that Ben alluded to and it was inferred in your question is that there is a large Asia presence of commercial users that operate in and around comfortably in the Middle East. So it gives us an interesting launch point, if you will, for additional derivative contracts. So, I think you will see us continue to build out this amazing suite that we have, including Abu Dhabi as a vehicle.\nKen Hill: Got it. Thanks for the additional color there.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Great. Thanks. Good morning everybody and to echo everyone\u2019s comments, Scott, Warren, MC, big congrats to all of you. I wanted to go back to the mortgage business for a second. So clearly, organic growth remains really strong. Ben, great to hear that the sales momentum continues to be above projections in the first quarter. But the market clearly seems to be overly concerned about the refi cliff, so to speak, in the market, which would hit your transaction revenue. So, can you help us maybe unpack how much of the $230 million is related to transaction revenues, is refi versus new purchases? I think legacy LMA was about 50-50, but that mix probably has evolved here. And I guess, how would you frame the downside risk to this revenue bucket, assuming current industry refinance expectations come through? And then secondly, I was hoping maybe we could hit on the expense interplay here as well to an extent that transaction revenues come down. Is there any expense offset we could see in that segment? Thanks.\nBen Jackson: Thanks Alex. This is Ben. I will start, and then I will hand it to Warren on the expense side. So, when you look at the \u2013 you had a number of different questions in there, so I will try to unpack a couple of different things that we are seeing. So first, the answer that I had for Rich\u2019s question is important to go back to. So, we are not looking at this as a quarter-over-quarter business and really worry or afraid about volumes that are changing each quarter because we see that there is just a long-term change that\u2019s happening towards digitization. We see substantial TAMs that are out there that when you look at our presence in each of those TAMs have not only a long runway, but we have a lot of opportunity for growth in each of them. The core being that Encompass and the network set that we have, where we have a little over 20% if you look at the trailing 12 months, roughly 20% of that TAM is a starting place that we have. And as we continue to sign new customers, as we continue to onboard those customers on, we are interacting with new loans, we are getting to more subscription revenue, we are getting more transaction volume, and those loans are interacting with more services on our network. We believe we are very well positioned to go after that. The other thing I can\u2019t emphasize enough is the other two TAMs are really a cross-sell opportunity. We are already touching at some point in our network from our customer acquisition and the point-of-sale systems that we have to the loan origination network that we have that\u2019s now interconnected to our closing network. We are touching just about every player in the mortgage ecosystem. So, our ability to sell these new services is a cross-sell. So, we feel very, very good about our position to grow in the closing \u2013 against the closing TAM, which we have roughly a 20% of that TAM today. But we are very uniquely positioned with the new eClose offering that we have launched to go after a significant amount more of that. And then on the AIQ, that\u2019s the automation of the actual underwrite process itself. We are seeing \u2013 we continue to see record sales volumes of that product, which, again, is a cross-sell to core Encompass customers. When it comes to mix on our platform, because if you look at just the loan originations side, there is a little bit of a tilt towards nonbank originators and nonbank originators tend to have a slight tilt towards purchase market versus refi. A lot of people do their refis with banks that they \u2013 large banks that they have their established banking relationships with. We tend to benefit more from a market that\u2019s moving more towards purchase. But that said, it\u2019s on the edges there. And when you look at our entire network, we are working with just about every player in the industry is utilizing one of our services around one point of our network.\nWarren Gardiner: And Alex, it\u2019s Warren. Just quickly on the expenses. So, there are definitely some variable expenses in there. What you would probably normally think about comp, marketing spend, things of that nature. But as Ben said, this isn\u2019t about second half or this isn\u2019t about a particular quarter. This is about a 10-year plan or strategy of doubling revenues from where we are today. And so we are going to continue to invest in that business. We talked about $40 million to $45 million, I think, when we gave guidance at the start of the year. And I think that should still kind of incremental expense, I should say. And so that\u2019s just still be kind of what you expect, I think, as you are looking into the second quarter, third quarter, fourth quarter and expect that to kind of ramp as things like investments like eClose and things of that nature, kind of continue to pick up some steam.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning folks. And also my congrats to Scott, Warren and MC as well. Just a two parter, again on Mortgage Tech. It\u2019s the topic of today, of course. Just in terms of that \u2013 of the strength in origination, Ben, if you can just touch on the recurring revenue side, the impact of market share gains versus revenues \u2013 cross-sell revenue synergies into that network base? And then the second part is on the closing side. I think you said 20% of $1 billion TAM. It looks like the revenue run rate there is $280 million. So, just want to double check. So that would be 28%, but I am sure I am using different denominators there. So, I just wanted to check on that and then your optimism on the growth in the closed business versus the rest of the Mortgage Technology business?\nBen Jackson: Thanks Brian. I will hit that last part first. So on the roughly 20%, I am looking at the last 12 months, and it\u2019s a rough gauge on that piece. The first part of the question, repeat the core of what you are looking for there?\nBrian Bedell: The core of that is from the recurring revenue gains that you have mentioned in the Mortgage Tech segment, especially in origination technology. Maybe if you can characterize what\u2019s coming from market share gains, from Encompass being better \u2013 getting better penetration of Encompass across the banks and financial network versus actual cross-sell into the network on \u2013 so it\u2019s more like a synergy basis?\nBen Jackson: Yes. Sure. So \u2013 and that\u2019s what I first answer that I gave to Rich, pleased with the new sales results that we have seen as well as cross-sell results that we have seen on the platform. And the way to think about that recurring revenue and what gives us confidence in the fact that, that recurring revenue will grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter, and we are guiding to growth next quarter is that we continue to see \u2013 and there is a mix in that recurring revenue line of customers that are expanding their footprint with us. And expanding their footprint with us can mean that they are adding new loan officers, they have more volume on their platform, so they go ahead and expand their footprint with us. And when they do that, that falls to the subscription line item very quickly. The second thing that you see is that we have cross-sells of other products to our customer base so they expand and buy other services that we have. It could be our AllRegs business, our Mavent business, very importantly, our AIQ services. So, we are seeing that as a very high cross-sell into our customer base. Some of those services require a short implementation timeframe, so after we sell it, there may be a lag before the subscription revenue comes. But that\u2019s the other element. And then new customers, we are seeing new customer acquisition. As I mentioned last quarter, a record Q3 and Q4 in terms of gathering new customers. And then Q1 well exceeded our expectations, both in our original model as well as our budget in terms of signing new customers onto the platform. And when we sign those new customers onto the platform, they do need to be implemented. It\u2019s a cloud-based platform, so the implementation isn\u2019t that long, but there is some lag between when we sell it, and then that drops to the subscription line. And then once the customers implement it, they start to ramp, and that\u2019s when we start to see the loan transaction volume and then those loans interacting with our network, then build and then we see more transaction volume building on that.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. That\u2019s great color. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Ari Ghosh with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nAri Ghosh: Hi, good morning everyone. Maybe just a quick follow-up, so Ben on Mortgage Tech. Maybe you just talked about customers expanding their subscription footprint with you, so as we think about that $4 billion data TAM that you highlighted, can you talk about the current data and analytics usage by a captive customer base, what\u2019s the level of customer penetration at present? Are these customers utilized a competitor data products or just maybe not leveraging much of these analytics in their workflows at present? Just to get a sense of penetration levels and the ease of kind of acquiring some of these services and growing that footprint, subscription footprint? Thanks so much.\nBen Jackson: Thanks for that question, Ari. It\u2019s Ben again. So, this is an area when you look at just the raw numbers versus the TAM. We are obviously very early stages here. So, we have 2% to 3% of the TAM, is what we have if you look at our current revenues versus a $4 billion opportunity here. And this we see as a near-term TAM that we are executing against. That\u2019s why we had it in the script. That\u2019s why we have highlighted in the last couple of calls that this AIQ offering is really seeing some good pickup across our customer base. We had record sales of it in the third quarter and fourth quarter. And this is another area where we have well exceeded our expectations into Q1 of really cross-selling this service into our Encompass customer base. And what this enables is it\u2019s really the core of where you are able to take out a ton of the manual processing. We have mentioned that our estimates are that it costs $8,000 to manufacture a loan today. And out of that, about $5,200 of that is just manual processing. And by first applying our automated document recognition and extraction technology, but then also putting our mortgage expertise on top of that to say, okay, as we extract this data out of the documents, as we automate it, we are able to take that information, put it into a database and compare it to what the income qualification and credit qualifications are for a particular product set because we have that whole \u2013 in our AllRegs business, we have the entire reference data set of, depending on the product, the customer is applying for, we know exactly what the qualification criteria are of that. So, we are able to take a lot of the manual steering compare work of comparing information that came in on our original customer application versus what\u2019s coming in as we are getting documents that we can verify and also cross-reference against what the criteria are to apply for that particular product. So, we feel great about it. It\u2019s early, but we are seeing this really as customers are starting to adopt it, they are getting the benefit of it. We are seeing other customers are catching from word-of-mouth in the industry that this is providing real benefits from their peers, and we are seeing our funnel just continue to strengthen in this area. And again, for the most part, it\u2019s a cross-sell into our existing base.\nAri Ghosh: Got it. Thanks so much and again congratulation Scott, Warren and MC as well.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Chris Harris with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nChris Harris: Thanks guys. On ICE Abu Dhabi, can you talk a little bit about how Murban might be distinctive or why you think it will win for some of the other benchmark alternatives that are out there targeting Asia?\nScott Hill: Yes, it\u2019s a good question. One of the sort of historical roots of the commodity exchange business has been that commodity tend to be priced at their near the source. In other words, it was grain price at grain elevators that were located near the fields. And in the case of energy, it\u2019s oil, natural gas or electricity price somewhere locationally near where it\u2019s produced. And then from a hedging standpoint, as a hedger would buy a contract on an exchange they would then need to add to that hedge a transportation or movement hedge on top of the commodity hedge. And so we \u2013 and as we got into organizing these commodities on futures exchanges that have clearing houses, the clearers price the risk, the credit risk of their customers. And so the commodity price that is determined on the exchange, if you will, doesn\u2019t have the customer credit risk in it, and it doesn\u2019t have the delivery risk in it. So in a sense, it\u2019s a pure commodity near where it\u2019s produced. And so one of the tensions that\u2019s going on in the market, particularly with the growth of Asia, China and more broadly, all of Asia is exchanges that we are forming up and pricing their product at the point of delivery. And so that\u2019s a different paradigm, if you will, for traditional commodities. And so one of the reasons that the State Oil Company of Abu Dhabi, began to work with us was the recognition of the fact that they had a strong desire to continue to control pricing of the commodity or have the \u2013 actually the market control pricing of the commodity at its point of production. And that the risk of delivery not being transferred back to the producer by having a delivery price contract. And so that was really the motivation, along with the continued growth of the Middle East and modernization of the infrastructure in the Middle East. And so it\u2019s a really good location, if you will, because of the energy footprint there and also just the growing economies of the Middle East and the interplay between the Middle East and Asia just seem like a very good place for us to have a geographic reference. And it\u2019s not surprising. We have done a lot of work underneath this launch, as you can imagine. And really, because of our global footprint, we are able to talk to commercial users around the world. But it\u2019s not fully surprising to us that this is working because of that historical dynamic was actually playing in our favor.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Chad. I want to again thank Scott Hill for his amazing contributions to the company and for all the success. And I want to thank everyone here for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you as we continue to execute and innovate. And with that we will close the call and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, sir. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ben Jackson",
            "content": "Congratulations to you, Scott. Thank you, and good morning to everyone on the call. Please turn to Slide 8. As we begin to emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic and the highly volatile environment we experienced in 2020. Our customers continue to rely on our global energy markets to navigate uncertainty and manage risk. And importantly, it's our network expertise and investment in technology that enables us to deliver innovative customer solutions and capture the growth opportunities provided by secular trends, such as the growing complexity of energy markets alongside the energy transition. In our oil markets, Brent crude serves as the cornerstone of a global network that includes key benchmarks such as WTI, Gasoil, RBOB Gas and most recently, Murban crude oil. By leveraging our global network, the launch of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, or IFAD, has enabled for the first time participants to come together and contribute to the price formation of Murban, an important benchmark for oil flowing through to Asia. In just its first month, Murban, along with related derivatives has traded over 150,000 contracts across 49 firms with growing open interest now over 45,000 lots making it one of the most successful futures launches in our industry's history. Thanks, Rich. This is Ben. And thanks for observing what we've seen in the marketplace in terms of a downturn in transaction volumes as I can confirm, we saw a downturn in closed loans on our encompass platform. When you look at Q1 closed loan volume versus Q4. And as our results are testament to, we were able to grow through it. And what I'd point to is what we said when we originally announced the deal back in September, in that we see, just like we saw in the commodities markets 2 decades ago, just like we've seen in the fixed income markets that the mortgage space is an industry that's going through a significant analog to digital transition. And we knew by combining the closing network that we have with the unique customer originator and investor network that Ellie Mae has that we can do something really special here for our customers in providing a digital future and a lot of efficiencies. And that's how we got conviction that we can grow through long-term cycles. And that's how we put out a guide, a 10-year guide of roughly doubling revenue when you look at that 8% to 10% guide over a 10-year period. That's roughly doubling revenue. And what we've seen in the platform has done nothing but strengthen our conviction over the last 8 months in our ability to do that. Last quarter, I mentioned that Q3 and Q4 sales expectations well exceeded our model. That we put together last summer when we did the deal. And Q1 continued this trend. And what we get \u2013 tactically, what you get when you're increasing your penetration into new sales, you're getting new subscription revenue when you implement and then as you ramp the customers up, you're getting more loans that you're interacting with is you're never interacting with before. Those loans than interactive services are our network. So you have a flywheel effect, you have a compounding effect. But I think more importantly, this is what I was trying to get through in the script, is that when a customer is choosing our solution set, they're choosing to fundamentally change their business. They're fundamentally choosing to remove manual processing and adopt digital ways to automate. And when they select us, they're selecting us to be the heart and lungs there. To be their network that's interconnecting them to every player that we interact with from our front-to-back network. And as they realize those benefits from being part of our ecosystem, it enables us to cross-sell our other services that I also mentioned in the script, such as our AIQ offering, which is that automation of the underwrite, as well as eClose. So that's what gives us conviction on the ability to grow this business sequentially, quarter-over-quarter on subscription revenue growth and to grow through downturns or to outperform downturns in terms of volumes just as we did Q1 versus Q4. Thanks for the question, Ken. It's Ben. And when you look at our futures markets and how we have developed them versus any of our peers, we have been stayed very close to the commercial customer base since our inception. And that's what's enabled us to develop literally hundreds of oil contracts around the world because it helps our customers not only manage the risk in a benchmark contract, but also help them manage their risk at the point of consumption or the point of production of where they have real risk. And we are the only truly global platform that enables customers with deep liquid markets in hundreds of marketplaces to be able to manage that risk. And with the backdrop of COVID going on the past year, we didn't stop moving. We continued to partner with our commercial customers around the world, and that's what led to the launch of ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, just in the last few weeks here. And in the early days, it looks like one of it to be \u2013 one of the most successful futures launches in history. And what I would point to with that is not only the volume growth, but also the \u2013 importantly, the significant open interest growth and the fact that there is 49 major players that are in there utilizing the contracts, establishing positions to manage risk. And I look at that compared to other parts of our oil business, that across the board are doing very well. If you compare our overall oil open interest right now in April versus the fourth quarter, we are up in almost every major product category. You compare April oil open interest versus April 2019, we are up in almost every category. If you look at under the covers from a year-over-year basis, while there is some tough compares, in there. We have significant product sets, such as our Asia Refined products set, gas oil in Dubai that are up year-over-year. So, we believe we have a great foundation. We have already been in Asia, have a number of significant products out there that enabled customers to hedge and manage risk. And we are going to stay very close to our commercial customer base to look for more opportunities to do so. Thanks Alex. This is Ben. I will start, and then I will hand it to Warren on the expense side. So, when you look at the \u2013 you had a number of different questions in there, so I will try to unpack a couple of different things that we are seeing. So first, the answer that I had for Rich's question is important to go back to. So, we are not looking at this as a quarter-over-quarter business and really worry or afraid about volumes that are changing each quarter because we see that there is just a long-term change that's happening towards digitization. We see substantial TAMs that are out there that when you look at our presence in each of those TAMs have not only a long runway, but we have a lot of opportunity for growth in each of them. The core being that Encompass and the network set that we have, where we have a little over 20% if you look at the trailing 12 months, roughly 20% of that TAM is a starting place that we have. And as we continue to sign new customers, as we continue to onboard those customers on, we are interacting with new loans, we are getting to more subscription revenue, we are getting more transaction volume, and those loans are interacting with more services on our network. We believe we are very well positioned to go after that. The other thing I can't emphasize enough is the other two TAMs are really a cross-sell opportunity. We are already touching at some point in our network from our customer acquisition and the point-of-sale systems that we have to the loan origination network that we have that's now interconnected to our closing network. We are touching just about every player in the mortgage ecosystem. So, our ability to sell these new services is a cross-sell. So, we feel very, very good about our position to grow in the closing \u2013 against the closing TAM, which we have roughly a 20% of that TAM today. But we are very uniquely positioned with the new eClose offering that we have launched to go after a significant amount more of that. And then on the AIQ, that's the automation of the actual underwrite process itself. We are seeing \u2013 we continue to see record sales volumes of that product, which, again, is a cross-sell to core Encompass customers. When it comes to mix on our platform, because if you look at just the loan originations side, there is a little bit of a tilt towards nonbank originators and nonbank originators tend to have a slight tilt towards purchase market versus refi. A lot of people do their refis with banks that they \u2013 large banks that they have their established banking relationships with. We tend to benefit more from a market that's moving more towards purchase. But that said, it's on the edges there. And when you look at our entire network, we are working with just about every player in the industry is utilizing one of our services around one point of our network. Thanks Brian. I will hit that last part first. So on the roughly 20%, I am looking at the last 12 months, and it's a rough gauge on that piece. The first part of the question, repeat the core of what you are looking for there? Yes. Sure. So \u2013 and that's what I first answer that I gave to Rich, pleased with the new sales results that we have seen as well as cross-sell results that we have seen on the platform. And the way to think about that recurring revenue and what gives us confidence in the fact that, that recurring revenue will grow sequentially quarter-over-quarter, and we are guiding to growth next quarter is that we continue to see \u2013 and there is a mix in that recurring revenue line of customers that are expanding their footprint with us. And expanding their footprint with us can mean that they are adding new loan officers, they have more volume on their platform, so they go ahead and expand their footprint with us. And when they do that, that falls to the subscription line item very quickly. The second thing that you see is that we have cross-sells of other products to our customer base so they expand and buy other services that we have. It could be our AllRegs business, our Mavent business, very importantly, our AIQ services. So, we are seeing that as a very high cross-sell into our customer base.

            "content": "Thank you, Ben, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn now to Slide 9. In the first quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share, delivering the best quarter in our company's history. And remarkably, we did this against last year's record-breaking volumes and volatility, which was largely driven by the onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Our results are a testament to the value of our data, technology and the strength of our strategic business model. The compounding growth of our subscription based services, combined with our diverse transaction-based businesses means that our growth is not tied to one economic cycle to one geography or to one asset class. Rather, it means growth on top of growth through all rate environments, across asset classes and around the world. Over the past 20 years, ICE has continually evolved to meet the needs of our customers and provide value for our stockholders. And for the past 14 years, I've had the privilege of working alongside Scott Hill as our growth story has unfolded. ICE has completed dozens of deals and made thousands of strategic decisions that have been rooted in the information and the quality metrics that were ingrained in our culture by Scott. Scott not only provided financial leadership for the company but he's played a vital role in providing strategic vision. He championed our unique culture, and he's mentored younger generations of leaders. And so I want to thank Scott for his contribution, for his dedication and for his leadership. And I want to wish him our best as he moves on to tackle the difficult life of branching in Texas. Scott will officially transition next month, and he'll remain an adviser and a mentor to ensure a smooth transition as Warren Gardner assumes the duties of CFO. Warren's has worked closely with Scott over the last 4 years and covered our sector as a senior research analyst for many years prior to this. Warren's knowledge of our business and our industry will help us to continue to build on the foundation that's been established by Scott, and continue a track record of growth. I also want to welcome MC as our new Investor Relations Head. Let me say thank you to our customers for their business and their trust in the quarter. And I want to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to delivering the best quarter in our company's history. With that, I'll now turn the call back over to our moderator, Chad, to conduct the question-and-answer session, which will run until 9:30 Eastern time. And this is Jeff. I think we \u2013 to get a little more embellishment, we have launched, I believe, now a dozen derivative contracts on that exchange. So we are moving quickly, if you will, to build out a broader product suite there. And one of the things that Ben alluded to and it was inferred in your question is that there is a large Asia presence of commercial users that operate in and around comfortably in the Middle East. So it gives us an interesting launch point, if you will, for additional derivative contracts. So, I think you will see us continue to build out this amazing suite that we have, including Abu Dhabi as a vehicle. Thank you, Chad. I want to again thank Scott Hill for his amazing contributions to the company and for all the success. And I want to thank everyone here for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you as we continue to execute and innovate. And with that we will close the call and have a great day."

            "content": "Thanks, Mary Caroline. Congratulations on your new role, truly well deserved. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some key highlights from our first quarter results. First quarter revenues, operating income, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share were all the best in the history of our company. Adjusted earnings per share of $1.34 increased 7% compared to our previous record of $1.25, which we achieved in last year's first quarter. Record total first quarter revenues of $1.8 billion were up 4% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. Total transaction revenues declined slightly versus an unprecedented backdrop a year ago. Importantly though, total recurring revenues, which represent about half our business, increased by 9% with all three of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth. First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $729 million, including $30 million related to Bakkt. Without the additional $7 million of Bakkt investments, we would have been toward the lower end of our original guidance. We expect that Bakkt's merger with Victory Park Spac will be completed toward the end of this quarter. We expect second quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $742 million to $752 million, including approximately $35 million of additional expense related to Bakkt. Incorporating the additional Bakkt expenses into our full year guidance as well as slightly higher-than-expected FX, which will be more than offset by higher revenues, we now expect full year adjusted expenses to be in the range of $2.88 billion to $2.93 billion. Yes, it's a good question. One of the sort of historical roots of the commodity exchange business has been that commodity tend to be priced at their near the source. In other words, it was grain price at grain elevators that were located near the fields. And in the case of energy, it's oil, natural gas or electricity price somewhere locationally near where it's produced. And then from a hedging standpoint, as a hedger would buy a contract on an exchange they would then need to add to that hedge a transportation or movement hedge on top of the commodity hedge. And so we \u2013 and as we got into organizing these commodities on futures exchanges that have clearing houses, the clearers price the risk, the credit risk of their customers. And so the commodity price that is determined on the exchange, if you will, doesn't have the customer credit risk in it, and it doesn't have the delivery risk in it. So in a sense, it's a pure commodity near where it's produced. And so one of the tensions that's going on in the market, particularly with the growth of Asia, China and more broadly, all of Asia is exchanges that we are forming up and pricing their product at the point of delivery. And so that's a different paradigm, if you will, for traditional commodities. And so one of the reasons that the State Oil Company of Abu Dhabi, began to work with us was the recognition of the fact that they had a strong desire to continue to control pricing of the commodity or have the \u2013 actually the market control pricing of the commodity at its point of production. And that the risk of delivery not being transferred back to the producer by having a delivery price contract. And so that was really the motivation, along with the continued growth of the Middle East and modernization of the infrastructure in the Middle East. And so it's a really good location, if you will, because of the energy footprint there and also just the growing economies of the Middle East and the interplay between the Middle East and Asia just seem like a very good place for us to have a geographic reference. And it's not surprising. We have done a lot of work underneath this launch, as you can imagine. And really, because of our global footprint, we are able to talk to commercial users around the world. But it's not fully surprising to us that this is working because of that historical dynamic was actually playing in our favor."

[Operator Instructions] I'll now hand over to your host, Katia Gonzalez, Investor Relations and Senior Analyst. Katia, please go ahead.\nKatia Gonzalez: Good morning. ICE's fourth quarter 2022 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2022 Form 10-K, and other filings with the SEC.  In addition, as we announced last year, ICE has agreed to acquire Black Knight. The transaction is pending customary regulatory approval and we expect to close in the first half of this year. In connection with the proposed transaction, ICE has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of ICE common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction. The registration statement includes a proxy statement of Black Knight that also constitutes a prospectus of ICE. Please see the Form S-4 filing for additional information regarding the transaction. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of our earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks, Katya. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide four with some of the key highlights from our fourth quarter results. Net revenues of $1.8 billion were driven by transaction revenues of $828 million and recurring revenues of $940 million, up 4% year-over-year. For the full year revenues totaled $7.3 billion, also up 4% versus last year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million, and we're within our guidance range, including approximately $5 million of additional severance. This strong performance helped to drive fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share $1.25 and full year adjusted EPS of $5.30, an increase of 5% versus 2021.  2022, free cash flow totaled a record $2.9 billion, which enabled us to return nearly $1.5 billion to shareholders while also continuing to make strategic investments across our business. In addition, we have received Board authorization to increase our quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.42 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, extending our 10-year track record of double digit dividend growth. Now let's move to Slide five, where I\u2019ll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment.  Fourth quarter net revenues totaled $982 million. Transaction revenues of over $600 million were driven in part by 11% growth in agricultural commodities, and 13% growth in our equity derivatives business. Importantly, open interest trends remain strong across our futures and options in January, including 14% growth in global natural gas and 24% growth in LIBOR. Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services, and our NYSC listings business increased by 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Customer growth, particularly within our energy exchange data was partially offset by slower growth in our listings business. While industry wide capital markets activity was relatively muted. It's worth noting that despite a slower year for IPOs, across the globe, we had a record year for listing transfers was 34, including more operating companies in the last three years combined. For the full year exchange segment, revenues increased by 8%, including a 33% increase in our interest rate business, a 20% increase in equity derivatives, and an 8% increase in our global natural gas revenues. Turning now to Slide six, I'll discuss our fixed income and data services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $537 million up 13% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 89%, including 182% growth in ICE bonds, and 66% growth in our CDS Clearing business. Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was driven by market volatility, higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms. Recurring revenue growth of 3% was driven by demand for additional capacity on ICE global network, as well as strong growth across our desktop, feeds and analytics offerings. We're beginning to see a return on the investments we've made in both enhance content and functionality. This performance is a key driver of our other data and network services business which increased by 8% in the fourth quarter, and 10%, excluding the impact of the Euronext migration. Somewhat offsetting with slower growth in our end-of-day pricing business, we're experiencing a slower sales cycle and pressure from asset base revenues in our index business, which declined double digits year-over-year, as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets, such as equities and corporate bonds, and communities and treasury ETFs.  For the full year, total segment, revenues totaled a record $2.1 billion up 13%. While adjusted operating margins expanded by 500 basis points, as anticipated recurring revenue grew 4% for the year and it was up 5% after adjusting for Euronext. Let's go next to Slide seven, where I\u2019ll discuss our Mortgage Technology Segment. Fourth quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $249 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for two-thirds of segment revenues totaled $164 million and grew 10% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive out performance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% decline in origination volumes. Importantly, they've now less revenues increased by over 30% year-over-year. For the full year, Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $1.1 billion, including a 16% increase in our recurring revenues, and a 24% increase in our data analytics revenues. And while industry volumes were actually below those seen three years ago in 2020 -- in 2019, pro forma 2022 Mortgage Technology revenues are higher by nearly 50%, representing a CAGR of roughly 14%. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide eight with some additional guidance.  Recurring revenues in 2023 were once again be led by our Mortgage Technology segment, where we are expecting mid to high single digit growth, a testament to the continued adoption of automation across the mortgage workflow.  In our fixed income and data services segment, we expect recurring revenue growth, excluding headwinds of approximately $15 million related to FX and the Euronext data center migration to once again be in the mid-single digits.  And lastly, in our Exchange segment, we expect recurring revenue growth excluding a $20 million headwind from the cessation of LIBOR to be in the low single digits. As continued growth in our energy exchange data services is offset by fewer IPOs and the tapering of 2021 initial listing fees.  Moving to expenses, we expect 2023 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $3.04 to $3.09 billion. Consistent with prior years, we will reward our employees for their contributions to our strong results, and therefore expect cash compensation expense to increase by approximately $20 to $40 million.  Strategic investments in technology operations and revenue related initiatives are expected to increase by $40 to $50 million, driven by higher licensees as well as investments across all three of our segments.  In addition, we expect roughly $45 million to $55 million of incremental noncash expense, including $25 million of D&A related to the rebuild of Ellie Mae CapEx. And lastly, we expect an FX benefit to our adjusted expenses by approximately $5 million to $15 million when compared to 2022. In summary, we delivered another record year of revenues, operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share. Across our business, we made strategic investments in future growth and as we enter 2023, we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers, once again, deliver profitable growth and create value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. 2022 was a year marked by rising inflation, rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Amidst this dynamic macroeconomic environment, we once again grew revenues, operating income and earnings per share, record results that are a testament to the resiliency and durability of our strategically diversified business model. In our financial futures markets, rising inflation and central bank activity across the globe presented an interest rate environment that has not been seen in generation, helping us drive 20% volume growth in our interest rate complex and 15% growth in our equity derivatives business.  Across our global energy markets, the events unfolding across North America, Europe, Russia and Asia have triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain, creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants to navigate.  In our global natural gas markets, an evolving energy supply chain in Europe has led to increased demand for global liquefied natural gas, or LNG, and has helped us drive a 17% increase in global gas volumes in 2022. This includes 24% growth in our North American gas business, which has benefited not only from increased commercial engagement with our Henry Hub contract but also our North American basis markets. These trends have continued into January with global natural gas open interest up 14% year-over-year, including 21% growth in North America. Although our European carbon markets experienced headwinds in 2022 due to the aforementioned factors, the secular trend towards cleaner energy continues and is a growth trend we are uniquely positioned to capture, as evidenced by the record year in our North American environmental markets with volumes up 5% year-over-year in 2022.  As we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is an evolution that we've long envisioned and is one of the largest providers of environmental products, including renewable fuel contracts, carbon allowances, nature-based solutions, renewable energy certificates as well as the wealth of climate data and related into season analytics. We are excited about the many future growth opportunities that lie ahead. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. Our comprehensive platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth and delivered another year of record revenues in 2022. This strong growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenue growth, again a testament to the strategic diversification of our business and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments.  Rising market uncertainty and interest rates are driving an increase in demand for credit protection, and we have seen this lead to increasing trading activity in our bonds business. These factors, coupled with our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bonds platforms, continued to record full year revenues -- to record revenues in our ICE Bonds business in 2022 up nearly 100% year-over-year. Turning now to our Mortgage business, increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. Our ability to capture this secular trend is evidenced by the strength and resiliency of our recurring revenues, which increased 16% in 2022. This continued strength is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate this analog to digital conversion. As mortgage origination volumes have normalized, customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation. In the fourth quarter, we had our strongest quarter of last year in terms of sales to new customers of our loan origination system with wins across each major segment we service.  In addition, there continues to be increased interest in our data and analytics products, which increased 31% in the quarter and 24% for the full year in 2022. Through our AIQ solution and analyzer tools customers can save thousands of dollars per loan by leveraging our data and analytics tools to drive automation in the loan manufacturing process. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders, and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion.  I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. I want to begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. As communicated, when making the announcement, we continued to believe that this transaction will close during the first half of this year.  Our respect for the Federal Trade Commission's work on this matter, and as we cooperate with them to gain regulatory approval, we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly, we remain excited about the efficiencies that the combined entities will bring to the end consumer and to other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem. In that vein, and shifting to what was yet another successful year, 2022 marked our 17th consecutive year of record revenues, record operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. This track record of growth reflects on the quality of our strategy and, more importantly, on the execution of that strategy. We've intentionally diversified across asset classes and geographies, so that we're not tied to any one cyclical trend or macroeconomic environment. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues to provide upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. We've placed the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog to digital conversion. The combination of these factors is what has made ICE an all-weather name and a business model that provides upside to volatility with less downside risk and, importantly, a business model that generates growth on top of growth. For example, in 2022, inflationary concerns and market speculation of central bank activity benefited our European and U.K. interest rate business, driving a 33% increase in revenues for the full year. These conditions also contributed to record full year revenues in our credit default swap clearing business, up 61% year-over-year, as rate volatility drove increased demand for risk management and credit protection. Across our mortgage business, even against this backdrop of rising interest rates, our business outperformed the broader market driven by strong recurring revenue growth, up 16% for the full year. Again, this is a reflection of the all-weather nature of our business model.  As we look to 2023 and beyond, we're positioned to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes, and we remain focused on executing on the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, extending our track record of growth. I'd like to conclude by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2022, and I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to the best year in our company's history.  And with that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator, Alex, who will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Rich, your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nRichard Repetto: Yes, good morning, Jeff and Ben and Warren. I wanted to ask about energy and more specifically natural gas. Ben, you made a lot of comments about how strong the U.S. natural gas markets are. You can see it in the volumes. But one issue it seems coming up is in the European natural gas and the TTF contract want to put in the right perspective, it's only 15%, I think, of the natural gas volumes but this whole deal with price caps that have been implemented and what you're going to do about it. And I guess it ties into the bigger question of politics and regulation impacting the markets, Jeff, as well. But anyway, the question on natural gas and sort of this broader intervention of government or regulation.\nBenjamin Jackson: Rich, it's Ben. Great question. To start, you got to remember that gas used to be a commodity that was highly dependent upon wellheads and pipeline infrastructure. So supply chains used to be a natural gas, very attached to that type of infrastructure. And whenever there was a disruption to that type of infrastructure, it's very difficult to adjust to rebalance those supply chains is all very localized, not really a global energy product. Fast forward to today, natural gas is very much a global energy product. It's a global energy supply chain, especially with the advent of LNG. And today, LNG can be freely flowed pretty much anywhere around the world as long as there's regasification capacity to do this. We saw this many years ago, and we've been investing in a global natural gas business that provides benchmarks around the world, has LNG contracts around the world that continue to expand as well as LNG freight contracts. So if you look at last year in GTF specifically, you had the unfortunate event where Russia invades Ukraine, and we saw significant energy supply disruptions where Russia was a significant supplier of oil, gas oil and natural gas, in particular, to Europe. And those supplies were effectively cut off. It created a very difficult trading situation for many of our market participants. At the same time, we saw market data subscriptions continue to grow in that part of our business. We saw more and more high balls and more of our community was growing around this. Fast forward to 2023, those supply chains have readjusted because natural gas is now a global commodity. And you have a significant amount of U.S. LNG and Middle Eastern LNG flowing now to Europe, backfilling a lot of those lost Russian gas supplies. So this market clarity has helped bolster confidence in trading products like ETF, and you see it already year open interest is up 10%. Volumes are up roughly 4% off of a comp of last year, which was actually pretty strong for TTF at the beginning of the year. Now for gas specifically, you have all kinds of macroeconomic environments that people need to manage risk around right now, but it's important to point out these are tradable events. Things like regasification coming online in Europe, so there's more and more gas that can come into Europe more efficiently. You've got storage -- gas storage facilities across Europe that have been filled.  Weather so far hasn't been an issue this year in Europe. European demand is down. So you have a potential for a recession that's looming. Chinese demand last year in '22 was down with the economy, for all intents and purposes, closed, and now it's reopening. And for the first time last year in '22, it's the first time that natural gas and LNG physical supplies into China is likely to reduce since the early '80s. So now with the reopening, what is that going to mean?  And then you also have a move towards a cleaner environment, where natural gas being the cleanest of the fossil fuels continues to be in high demand. These are all macroeconomic environments that can be tradable. They are all things that people can forecast around. And we feel great about the position that we have with the business that we've built to help traders manage around that, and we continue to invest in new contracts in the LNG space, few basis contracts in Europe around that. Now on price caps, I have mentioned on the last call, I went through a whole bunch of different issues that price caps can introduce around the difficulty you can create for people to manage and trade risk. ESMA has even come out recently with a comment that the unfortunate consequences of a price cap can be making it difficult for people to manage risk. Now for the aforementioned factors that I mentioned, the price of TTF has come way down. And the price cap right now is set at north of 3 times where TTF is trading. But that said, these can create issues for our market participants. So what we've decided to do is we're launching a new TTF contract in the U.K., it's a look-alike to the one we have in the Netherlands now, to provide customers a choice.  It's important to point out that, that TTF contract is going to trade alongside another TTF contract that we already have in the U.K. called the TTF frontline. It's a U.S. dollar-denominated contract that's oftentimes used as a basis contract to trade LNG cargoes because those are also U.S. dollar-denominated. And all those contracts cleared in the U.K. already. So we already have a community of traders that are attached to us in the U.K. for that. And it's a hedge. If they decide to use it, great. At a minimum for us, it provides us a free market price discovery mechanism to manage risk in our clearing house and to settle contracts.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies. Daniel, your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nDaniel Fannon: Thanks, good morning. I wanted to follow up on the fixed income and data outlook as you think about '23, the mid-single-digit growth. Can you talk about the inputs that you're assuming for 2023, whether that's pricing and where the growth is? And I know you've cited some headwinds in '22. And maybe elaborate a little bit on that and maybe how you're thinking about changes within those headwinds going forward.\nWarren Gardiner: Dan, it's Warren. Good question. So there's not really much change in terms of our expectations and our targets as we head into next year. A couple of years ago, we outlined the growth algorithm for the data business, and that's been pretty consistent for the last couple of years. So there'll be a little bit of price we talked about in prior years, that being around a third of the growth. There will certainly be contributions from new customers, contributions from current customers purchasing more. And so I think it's a pretty similar algorithm if you're thinking about this year versus past years.  I think when we're thinking about 2023 specifically, look, the macro, those factors are a little bit difficult to predict. I mean, AUM fees, particularly the last two quarters, those have been something that have weighed on us a little bit. I don't know exactly where those are going to go next year. It does feel like certainly in areas like fixed income, we could see some stabilization. And frankly, fixed income could very quickly become a very attractive asset class. So look, we're having some really good conversations with customers. We are a data superstore, if you will, We're indices, we're end-of-day pricing. We have analytics. We have got desktops. We've got fees. It's a really diverse business. And so it's an opportunity for us to have conversations with customers in this kind of environment than we are to maybe find ways to save but spend more with us.  And that's something I think you've heard us talk about the last couple of years. So there's nothing really different about our target. But again, we're certainly cognizant that it's a somewhat challenging environment for a lot of our customers at the moment.\nLynn Martin: Hi, Dan, this is Lynn. I'm just going to jump in with a bit more color on what Warren said. I think this segment, in particular, really illustrates the all-weather nature of the ICE name. And the ability for this segment to grow 13% in spite of some of the challenges Warren has highlighted really underpin that.  If you look at the execution side of the business, volatility has certainly been a tailwind, but importantly, new products and new customer acquisition has also been driver of our growth, new products in the CDS clearing side of the business, including our CDS options.  In terms of ICE bonds, we've actually been able to grow our institutional market share. Institutional business in the muni asset class, in particular, is up 205% in Q4 alone, 175% for the full year. And we've been able to gain in muni about 650 basis points of share in 2022, really driven by the work we've done with the institutions to plug into their workflows. Now obviously, some of the macro forces have impacted the fixed income and data and analytics line, as Warren highlighted, slightly slower sales cycle in our pricing business. AUM trends driving out of our higher capture products into our lower fee capture products. But I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the outsized performance of our other data services line, where we haven't seen a slowdown in the sales cycle. And this was really fueled by demand for capacity, which was up 18% in the quarter, double-digit growth in our desktop and derivatives analytics businesses as well as strong growth in our fees business. So I think when you take a step back and look at the segment overall, we couldn't be more optimistic about the ability for that segment, in particular, to grow, compounding in a variety of macroeconomic positions because of the all-weather nature of the name.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Ken, your line is now open. \nKen Worthington: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow up on Rich's question, but with a focus on oil I wanted to dig a bit deeper into some of the changes that are being made there. You mentioned on the last call that you were taking Russian molecules out of the benchmark and highlighted the reconstitution maybe adding to activity levels in Brent. Given that Russian oil continues to flow pretty actively in Europe, is the reconstitution helping or hurting like you thought? And then secondly, I think Midland WTI has been added to Brent. To what extent do you see this inclusion making Brent an even more relevant benchmark? And as we think about Brent as a competing product to WTI, might this shift further drive share to ICE and Brent in oil?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Ken. It's Ben. Great question. And yes, you're right. You had the same dynamic that I highlighted before on TTF with oil as well as downstream products like gas oil as well, to some degree, getting cut off from Europe. But we have seen a similar dynamic that I mentioned in the natural gas markets where you have U.S., Norway and Middle Eastern oil now flowing in to help address some of that supply that has been lost based on Russia effectively cutting that off. So what we have seen -- since we announced in the second half of last year, that Russian molecules were no longer deliverable into the gas oil contract as an example. One of the things that we saw develop underneath the covers is that open interest in gas oil from October 1 to the end of last year grew 100% in deliveries starting in January of this year. And then since the end of the year, it's grown another 14%. So all that is showing the underlying health of the return and bolstering of market confidence coming back to products like gas oil, once that specificity was created. That said, you have a whole -- so we're seeing market confidence come back. Brent's up as well since the beginning of the year. So we feel good about that contract. Our Brent options contract has also done very well. But all of these supply chain changes around the world is why we've been making the investments we've had in a whole bunch of different areas around oil over the last few years. Two years ago, we've announced and launched ICE Futures Abu Dhabi and the Murban contract. And the interesting development we've seen with Murban is that Murban historically priced Middle Eastern barrels going out to Asia. And now, as I mentioned, Middle Eastern oil is also backfilling, to some degree, some of the supply cuts happen from Russia on oil supplies. And we're seeing Murban now being used to price Middle Eastern barrels that are going into Europe. That's one of the things that's feeding north of a 50% growth in Murban year-to-date this year. So we're off to a great start there. The Midland WTI contract that you highlighted, we launched that contract a year ago. And that contract is off to a great start. Tons of physical traders in it, prices, Midland TI that goes to Houston and hits the water and a lot of that oil is going over to Europe, it's a perfect product for people to use to hedge cargoes that are going into Europe. And again, with that supply chain dynamic of U.S. oil, backfilling a lot of the Russian oil that was cut off, we were very well positioned there. And then at the midpoint of this year, that Midland contract is perfectly positioned to be traded in parallel to Brent with those Midland TI barrels coming into the Brent index. So we feel very well positioned with all of the investments we've been making in and around oil in anticipation of potential supply chain changes, and we think we're well positioned there for growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Allen of Citi. Chris, your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nChris Allen: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask about Mortgage Tech recurring revenue outlook. You noted some bright spots in your comments just in terms of some of the sales you're seeing, the conversations you're having with customers, but we're seeing this continue to somewhat -- to decline in terms of the pace of growth, albeit still at healthy levels.  And coming into the mortgage slowdown, you kind of noted that the mortgage industry was have been very busy during the single upturn. Now that the downturn occurred, there was an opportunity set to improve efficiency there that it's almost going to an acceleration of recurring revenue growth. So maybe you could kind of frame out the decline in the Mortgage Tech revenue growth outlook. What's being driven just in terms of the overall dampening of the industry right now? What's kind of the opportunity set in terms of further customer penetration going forward?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thank you. Thank you for the question. Great question. And I always highlight, and it's important to point out, that we're looking to build this business and build some fundamental building blocks that enable this business to grow 8% to 10% over a long period of time. And you're right. So we've made a very concerted effort. One of the big cornerstones of that strategy is a concerted move to move transaction revenue more and more towards subscription to make the business model much more predictable underneath that.  And we feel good about the fact that we've been able to grow subscription revenue in the fourth quarter of 9% given the backdrop of an environment where volumes were down 60% and sequentially, they were down 20% approximately. So in that environment, we're still able to grow it. And I'll be the first to highlight, the mortgage industry didn't expect the downturn to happen as fast as it did or as rapidly and as deep as it did. So we have seen with some of our clients that are coming up for renewal. We've seen some clients consolidate, gone through M&A on true business. And so we've seen some cancellations due to those factors. That has created some headwinds into the business. But offsetting that, we've had a number of different items that have enabled us to grow and give us confidence in the ability to grow the business going forward. The first thing is that of the renewals we had last quarter, north of 60% of them renewed at higher subscription rates than they did at the beginning of the quarter due to our strategy to intentionally shift more transaction revenue towards subscription and also success in cross-selling more clients -- more products to our clients. The second is we had a very strong quarter and encompassed sales. In fact, the strongest quarter that we had of all of 2022 was in the fourth quarter. And we've seen that in a couple of different areas. So we saw it across all the different segments that we cover. So I think of banks, non-bank originators, brokers, credit unions. But we also saw a lot of new start-up companies coming to us.  So with the unfortunate backdrop of people getting downsized in this mortgage environment, several of those impacted employees are becoming entrepreneurs, starting up their own mortgage shops. And we're very well positioned to win that business, albeit it may be at a lower subscription fee to start, but we have the ability to grow with them as this mortgage market will snap back at some point in time. We also see, just looking out into the future that there's a lot of large banks, large -- a lot of large home lending banks that have legacy infrastructure in-house systems that they've been running for years that are looking to upgrade and replace that.  We think our funnel reflects that, and we feel really good about the prospects that those companies are looking to continue to make investments here in 2023, which will lead to growth factors for us going into the future. So that's a little bit of color of what happened in the fourth quarter as well as why we feel good about our prospects going forward.\nJeff Sprecher: And I think if you step back -- this is Jeff. If you step back, what we're talking to the industry about is a fundamental shift in the way they assemble and manufacture mortgages to take costs out of the system, to move the industry to more of a SaaS model, subscription-based model instead of a model where every single mortgage is put together a la carte with services and the cost of a first-time homebuyers mortgage versus the cost of a $1 million mortgage are essentially the same in the current system. And it just makes sense to us that if we can give the industry a more predictable way of operating their businesses, they can be more responsive to their customers and allocate costs proportionately across their business, which is the way business is done in most other digital markets or markets that have moved from analog to digital.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS. Alex, your line is now open.\nAlex Kramm: Good morning, everyone. Just wanted to ask about pricing holistically across the business. When you look at the data services space, some of your peers, maybe some of them in the desktop space that you're not in, but we're seeing price increases because of inflation. Your primary peer in the futures trading side also seems to have been taken a bigger price increase than usual this year. So when you put this all together and you look at your business, it seems like you're leaving some money on the table and you're a little bit afraid to kind of like turn that lever a little bit more. So just wondering if you're thinking, is it all evolving given the higher inflationary environment that's obviously driving your cost higher as well?\nWarren Gardiner: Alex, this is Warren. It's a good question. We've certainly seen some of the peers out there and what they've done on the pricing front. It's always been our philosophy that, when we're going to increase price, it will come with value added to the particular product that we're increasing that price on. And that hasn't changed, and that's not going to change this year. I think from our perspective, the better long-term strategy is to operate that way, and that's what we're going to be doing this year. And we mentioned a little bit earlier on the Fixed Income and Data Services side, there really wasn't much difference in terms of how we're approaching that this year. We do have a small amount of contracts, it's pretty immaterial at the end of the day, that are benchmarked to inflation. But I don't think you'd really notice that at the end of the day, depending on how much that will fluctuate. So on that front, I would say it's pretty consistent. On the futures side, we're always looking at that as an option. But again, it's something we haven't really pulled lever on up until this point, and there certainly have been instances in the past where we've done it. But something we are thinking about and always thinking about, frankly. So I wouldn't necessary that's much of a change. But yes, that's something that's out there and certainly on what some of the others have been doing.\nJeff Sprecher: And this is Jeff. I would just mention that we spend a tremendous amount of time focused on our own costs and the cost of delivering these products and continue to make prudent investments but underneath allocate to personnel and resources.  We've been -- you may notice, of all the major exchange groups, we've been the most cautious, if you will, of moving business to the cloud because those are areas where we've seen the largest cost increases and the most unpredictable rises in cost. So we have continued to be conservative in delivering our products the way our customers want to see them but trying to do it in a way that is very, very cost efficient.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein of Goldman Sachs. Alex, your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nAlex Blostein: Hi, everybody good morning. Thanks for the question. I just want to go back to some of the energy dynamics in the space. And I was hoping you guys could talk about the environmentals for a bit. It\u2019s great to see the TTF complex kind of coming back to life here in January. What would it take to get, I guess, the environmental products going again? And kind of what are some of the dynamics in that market for '23?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. And we feel really, really great about the position we have in the environmental marketplace. As you know, we were here very, very early. Almost 13 years ago is when we acquired the Climate Exchange, and that was really the foundational piece to it. And we've been building and investing around this the entire time since we've owned that and now have the most global complete suite of solutions there that are helping our clients price carbon, offset their carbon risks, trade renewable energy credits, et cetera. And one of the other strengths that we have to our environmental business is that there's a symbiotic relationship that we see with energy. A lot of people that are producing energy or consuming energy need to care about the price of carbon. So we see a symbiotic relationship there. For our business, if you look under the covers of what was going on last year in 2022, we did see some headwinds, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, on the European Union allowance markets. And a lot of that was associated to time, capital and attention being paid towards the energy markets. That said, we continue to see market data subscriptions, in particular, environmentals, are growing nicely over the years. So we continue to have people added into our community between our market data, between our ICE instant messaging platform and chat platform. We continue to grow visibility and interest into our markets there. I'd also point out that the European Union late last year reaffirmed the trading scheme and continue to signal that things like free allowance thresholds, so the amount of carbon that you're allowed to emit before you have to buy allowance, all those are going to start coming down, which means that more carbon is going to need to be priced and more sectors of the economy are going to be captured. So from a long term looking out over the horizon perspective, that's a tailwind of growth. We launched our U.K. allowance platform. That was up nicely last year, up 16% and North America, as I had mentioned, had a record last year of almost 3.7 million lots traded with a record number of market participants in there. Our regi contracts, which is regional greenhouse gas emissions California carbon allowances, renewable fuels all had a great year. We continue to invest here by launching new contracts. We launched tech wind solar contracts last year, and we also launched a few tranches of nature-based offsets. One of the things that we announced at the end of last year that may have flown under the radar for people is when you look at the offset market in the carbon and environmental credit markets, those markets tend to be called voluntary, and they are very nascent. Those are markets that no one has really been able to effectively develop yet, and they're all in very, very early stages. One of the key problems we think that there is from our experience in developing other markets is that there's a fundamental -- fundamentally very difficult for somebody to understand what is the offset that one would want to trade. What is the underlying reference data associated to it? What are the components that make up that offset or that environmental credit? What's the quality of that credit? Basic supply information like how much was issued when it was originally issued, how much has been retired and how much still exists. So we launched, at the end of the year, a reference data service where our community of over 100,000 instant messaging and chat clients that are traders that are utilizing that all day long, they're energy traders, they're environmental market traders can instantly look up any offset, any environmental credit, be able to get all of the reference data associated to that credit; how much was issued when it was issued;, how much has been expired, how much is still available to trade, this is all basic fundamental supply data that people need to be able to price -- fundamentally price the contract. So we pulled all that together, so you can gather all that information on a near real-time basis. We pulled it together from a variety of different sources to make what was hours worth of work, if not days, can be done instantaneously. And obviously, with that information, it can help with price formation and eventually interaction with our community to help identify people that would want to trade.  So we feel great about our positioning there. We're investing there, and that's just one significant example of a nascent market that we think we have some foundational elements that we're so excited about.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Simon Clinch of Atlantic Equities. Simon, your line is now open.\nSimon Clinch: Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to cycle back to the mortgage business. And specifically looking at the transaction revenues, I was just wanting -- as you're increasingly looking to shift your revenue streams towards the recurring revenue line over time, should we look at that as do start to rebound?  And then secondly, is there -- should we assume that the sort of level of outgrowth versus -- of the transaction revenues versus those mortgage industry volumes should narrow and to zero because we're effectively shifting all of your business to recurring revenue streams? Just trying to understand the dynamic that's going on between the recurring revenues and transaction revenues right at this point.\nBenjamin Jackson: Sure. Simon, it's Ben. So there's a couple of different pieces to that question that I'll cover. So on transaction revenue, we have said we are willing to give up some transaction revenue that we have today. So take, for example, a \"success\" fee. When a loan is codified, there's a transactional fee associated to that, that where -- if we lower that to some degree for our clients but shift more of that towards recurring revenue and more predictable revenue to us, we'll do that. So there is some short-term impact to our transaction -- to existing transaction revenues. At the same time, we have a whole suite of other services that we're cross-selling to our stable of 3,000 Encompass customers, for example, around the world, some of which are recurring, some of which are transaction that, as those continue to mature because they're very early stages but are showing some great signs of success, our ability to cross-sell those, things like our data and analytics offerings, which we -- were transactions that we've tilted much more towards subscription. But then we also have services in our closing line item that we're continuing to invest in and we're continuing to add on that will be incremental transaction revenues. So there's a mix underneath the covers there. But we believe that having a more predictable business model for the longer term will enable us to continue to grow the business at 8% to 10% a year for a long period of time.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Craig, your line is now open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, everyone. I wanted to come back to Ben's commentary that 4Q is the strongest Mortgage Tech sales quarter since last year. What products drove the increase in 4Q versus the prior quarters? And also given several announcements of exits and downsizes in the residential mortgage world, and I'm thinking Wells Fargo is probably the biggest, which products are you seeing under the most pressure on the sales front in 4Q?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks for the question, Craig. So a lot of what we saw in terms of sales strength, so I'll just -- I'll talk about 2022 first, then I'll go in the fourth quarter. So for 2022 as a whole, our AIQ, that -- the automation service that's lowering the cost of manufacturing a loan to our clients was very strong throughout the entire year and each quarter. We had a good quarter in selling new clients onto that platform. Again, that's hopefully lowering their cost of manufacturing along a lot of the comments that Jeff made before. And hopefully, those cost savings get passed on to the end consumer. In the fourth quarter, it was an interesting dynamic. It was actually our -- the core Encompass product that drove that sales strength that we had in the fourth quarter. So what we're seeing is that, while you do have customers that are consolidating, you have some M&A, you have some downsizing that's happening with that client mix. The two things that we see in parallel are that, one, a lot of the banks credit unions, non-bank originators, they're using this time to invest in infrastructure.  So if they have in-house systems, for example, which is often what we're unseating, they're looking to invest in their infrastructure to be ready for when this market snaps back. Looking at our funnel going forward, we know that a lot of the big banks are looking at that, that infrastructure that they have and looking at making investments to position them well when the market snaps back. And then the other thing that we're seeing is, as I mentioned, as employees are impacted by these downsizings. We're seeing a lot of them start new shops. And as entrepreneurs, they're starting new shops, and we're well positioned to win that business as well.  So we're very well positioned across the entire spectrum. And people are taking -- we see people taking advantage of the opportunity right now where there is a strain in the system to invest and be ready for when the market comes back.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian, your line is now open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks, good morning folks. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to turn back to fixed income trading. It's been on such a strong growth trajectory. And when you described good traction in the muni business and data, maybe if you can talk a little bit more about the mix of revenues within that business. I know the market share gains have been really good. Is it mostly munis? And just thinking about the sustainability of this, munis has been growing more than doubling on a year-over-year basis, reaching a $100 million annual revenue business in the second quarter and if it can continues to grow like sequentially, it will be a $200 million annual business within a couple of quarters. So just trying to get a sense of the drivers behind that and if you think this momentum can continue?\nLynn Martin: Yes. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned, volatility certainly did help out this business, but a lot of the share gains we've achieved in the institutional side of the business has really been what's driving the growth. 26% in Q4 of our muni activity came from institutional accounts. So that's up from 13% in 2020 when we started to acquire all of these different platforms. So we've really been able to increased institutional footprint. We do see opportunities also in treasuries and CDs. Those two asset classes within the execution segment have outperformed a lot of that volatility-driven. But the toughest thing to do is to get the plumbing into the institutional accounts. And I think the deliberate decisions we took a couple of years ago to be workflow-agnostic, to work with a variety of providers to plumb our platforms into a variety of workflow solutions have really beared fruit in 2022. So when volatility came into the market, it wasn't just about your traditional retail trader that was executing the munis and corporates. It's now about the institutional trader that sees us as a diversified platform across multiple asset classes in fixed income.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys of Morgan Stanley. Michael, your line is now open. Please go ahead. \nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thanks. I wanted to circle back on Mortgage Technology. With the recurring revenues up about 16% mid-teens in 2022, I was hoping you might be able to help unpack what portion of that recurring revenue growth was from unit growth, from existing -- excuse me, unit growth from new customers versus wallet share gains from existing customers where you're expanding the services they are offering to them versus what portion of the growth is coming from current versions from transactional to the recurring revenue side. And then when you look ahead to '23 with your mid- to high single-digit growth there on the recurring revenue sides and Mortgage Tech, how do you see that mix evolving in your outlook into '23? Thank you.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thank you, Michael. It's Ben. And it's a mix on it. You hit on some of the elements in the way you asked the question. So our view has been that when you have this significant stable of customers, the 3,000 lenders that are on our platform and utilizing our services, there's a tremendous opportunity to cross-sell.  And one of the things that's really driving that recurring revenue growth is the success we have in continuing to sell our AIQ platform into that customer base. We have a long way to go in being able to penetrate those 3,000 lenders and be able to provide them the efficiency that they need now more than ever. So we feel good about our ability to cross-sell and how we've executed on it to date since we acquired, the former Ellie Mae business and looking forward ahead into the future. The other thing is new sales. So we continue to have great success adding new customers. Customers can come on and utilize that AIQ, offering those analysis to other third-party providers. So we continue to have success there. And we also continue to add new customers on to Encompass. And I just answered a question on that. A couple of questions that go here. So we continue to have great success in the Encompass for all the different segments that we sell through. Whether it's a start-up company, whether it's an established non-bank originator, whether it's a bank or a credit union, we're a broker across the entire spectrum, we believe the investments we've made in our platform is very well positioned to meet those clients' needs. And as we see a lot of the major home lenders in the U.S. looking to replace in-house legacy infrastructure, we think we're also very well placed to win that business as well. So those are the key drivers -- as well as it's having very relatively low attrition. We are a core platform for operating these businesses. So unless they're going out of business or there's M&A that's happening, we're not losing business.\nOperator: Thank you. We have no further questions for today. So I will hand back to Jeff Sprecher for any further remarks.\nJeff Sprecher: Well, thank you, Alex. Thank you all for joining us here this morning. We are continuing to innovate for our customers and build an all-weather business model and delivery growth. And so with that, I hope you'll have a great day and appreciate your being with us.\nOperator: Thank you for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks, Katya. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide four with some of the key highlights from our fourth quarter results. Net revenues of $1.8 billion were driven by transaction revenues of $828 million and recurring revenues of $940 million, up 4% year-over-year. For the full year revenues totaled $7.3 billion, also up 4% versus last year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million, and we're within our guidance range, including approximately $5 million of additional severance. This strong performance helped to drive fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share $1.25 and full year adjusted EPS of $5.30, an increase of 5% versus 2021.  2022, free cash flow totaled a record $2.9 billion, which enabled us to return nearly $1.5 billion to shareholders while also continuing to make strategic investments across our business. In addition, we have received Board authorization to increase our quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.42 per share, beginning in the first quarter of 2023, extending our 10-year track record of double digit dividend growth. Now let's move to Slide five, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment.  Fourth quarter net revenues totaled $982 million. Transaction revenues of over $600 million were driven in part by 11% growth in agricultural commodities, and 13% growth in our equity derivatives business. Importantly, open interest trends remain strong across our futures and options in January, including 14% growth in global natural gas and 24% growth in LIBOR. Recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services, and our NYSC listings business increased by 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Customer growth, particularly within our energy exchange data was partially offset by slower growth in our listings business. While industry wide capital markets activity was relatively muted. It's worth noting that despite a slower year for IPOs, across the globe, we had a record year for listing transfers was 34, including more operating companies in the last three years combined. For the full year exchange segment, revenues increased by 8%, including a 33% increase in our interest rate business, a 20% increase in equity derivatives, and an 8% increase in our global natural gas revenues. Turning now to Slide six, I'll discuss our fixed income and data services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $537 million up 13% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 89%, including 182% growth in ICE bonds, and 66% growth in our CDS Clearing business. Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was driven by market volatility, higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms. Recurring revenue growth of 3% was driven by demand for additional capacity on ICE global network, as well as strong growth across our desktop, feeds and analytics offerings. We're beginning to see a return on the investments we've made in both enhance content and functionality. This performance is a key driver of our other data and network services business which increased by 8% in the fourth quarter, and 10%, excluding the impact of the Euronext migration. Somewhat offsetting with slower growth in our end-of-day pricing business, we're experiencing a slower sales cycle and pressure from asset base revenues in our index business, which declined double digits year-over-year, as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets, such as equities and corporate bonds, and communities and treasury ETFs.  For the full year, total segment, revenues totaled a record $2.1 billion up 13%. While adjusted operating margins expanded by 500 basis points, as anticipated recurring revenue grew 4% for the year and it was up 5% after adjusting for Euronext. Let's go next to Slide seven, where I'll discuss our Mortgage Technology Segment. Fourth quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $249 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for two-thirds of segment revenues totaled $164 million and grew 10% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive out performance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% decline in origination volumes. Importantly, they've now less revenues increased by over 30% year-over-year. For the full year, Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $1.1 billion, including a 16% increase in our recurring revenues, and a 24% increase in our data analytics revenues. And while industry volumes were actually below those seen three years ago in 2020 -- in 2019, pro forma 2022 Mortgage Technology revenues are higher by nearly 50%, representing a CAGR of roughly 14%. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide eight with some additional guidance.  Recurring revenues in 2023 were once again be led by our Mortgage Technology segment, where we are expecting mid to high single digit growth, a testament to the continued adoption of automation across the mortgage workflow.  In our fixed income and data services segment, we expect recurring revenue growth, excluding headwinds of approximately $15 million related to FX and the Euronext data center migration to once again be in the mid-single digits.  And lastly, in our Exchange segment, we expect recurring revenue growth excluding a $20 million headwind from the cessation of LIBOR to be in the low single digits. As continued growth in our energy exchange data services is offset by fewer IPOs and the tapering of 2021 initial listing fees.  Moving to expenses, we expect 2023 adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $3.04 to $3.09 billion. Consistent with prior years, we will reward our employees for their contributions to our strong results, and therefore expect cash compensation expense to increase by approximately $20 to $40 million.  Strategic investments in technology operations and revenue related initiatives are expected to increase by $40 to $50 million, driven by higher licensees as well as investments across all three of our segments.  In addition, we expect roughly $45 million to $55 million of incremental noncash expense, including $25 million of D&A related to the rebuild of Ellie Mae CapEx. And lastly, we expect an FX benefit to our adjusted expenses by approximately $5 million to $15 million when compared to 2022. In summary, we delivered another record year of revenues, operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share. Across our business, we made strategic investments in future growth and as we enter 2023, we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers, once again, deliver profitable growth and create value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben. Dan, it's Warren. Good question. So there's not really much change in terms of our expectations and our targets as we head into next year. A couple of years ago, we outlined the growth algorithm for the data business, and that's been pretty consistent for the last couple of years. So there'll be a little bit of price we talked about in prior years, that being around a third of the growth. There will certainly be contributions from new customers, contributions from current customers purchasing more. And so I think it's a pretty similar algorithm if you're thinking about this year versus past years.  I think when we're thinking about 2023 specifically, look, the macro, those factors are a little bit difficult to predict. I mean, AUM fees, particularly the last two quarters, those have been something that have weighed on us a little bit. I don't know exactly where those are going to go next year. It does feel like certainly in areas like fixed income, we could see some stabilization. And frankly, fixed income could very quickly become a very attractive asset class. So look, we're having some really good conversations with customers. We are a data superstore, if you will, We're indices, we're end-of-day pricing. We have analytics. We have got desktops. We've got fees. It's a really diverse business. And so it's an opportunity for us to have conversations with customers in this kind of environment than we are to maybe find ways to save but spend more with us.  And that's something I think you've heard us talk about the last couple of years. So there's nothing really different about our target. But again, we're certainly cognizant that it's a somewhat challenging environment for a lot of our customers at the moment. Alex, this is Warren. It's a good question. We've certainly seen some of the peers out there and what they've done on the pricing front. It's always been our philosophy that, when we're going to increase price, it will come with value added to the particular product that we're increasing that price on. And that hasn't changed, and that's not going to change this year. I think from our perspective, the better long-term strategy is to operate that way, and that's what we're going to be doing this year. And we mentioned a little bit earlier on the Fixed Income and Data Services side, there really wasn't much difference in terms of how we're approaching that this year. We do have a small amount of contracts, it's pretty immaterial at the end of the day, that are benchmarked to inflation. But I don't think you'd really notice that at the end of the day, depending on how much that will fluctuate. So on that front, I would say it's pretty consistent. On the futures side, we're always looking at that as an option. But again, it's something we haven't really pulled lever on up until this point, and there certainly have been instances in the past where we've done it. But something we are thinking about and always thinking about, frankly. So I wouldn't necessary that's much of a change. But yes, that's something that's out there and certainly on what some of the others have been doing."

            "content": "Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. 2022 was a year marked by rising inflation, rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Amidst this dynamic macroeconomic environment, we once again grew revenues, operating income and earnings per share, record results that are a testament to the resiliency and durability of our strategically diversified business model. In our financial futures markets, rising inflation and central bank activity across the globe presented an interest rate environment that has not been seen in generation, helping us drive 20% volume growth in our interest rate complex and 15% growth in our equity derivatives business.  Across our global energy markets, the events unfolding across North America, Europe, Russia and Asia have triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain, creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants to navigate.  In our global natural gas markets, an evolving energy supply chain in Europe has led to increased demand for global liquefied natural gas, or LNG, and has helped us drive a 17% increase in global gas volumes in 2022. This includes 24% growth in our North American gas business, which has benefited not only from increased commercial engagement with our Henry Hub contract but also our North American basis markets. These trends have continued into January with global natural gas open interest up 14% year-over-year, including 21% growth in North America. Although our European carbon markets experienced headwinds in 2022 due to the aforementioned factors, the secular trend towards cleaner energy continues and is a growth trend we are uniquely positioned to capture, as evidenced by the record year in our North American environmental markets with volumes up 5% year-over-year in 2022.  As we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is an evolution that we've long envisioned and is one of the largest providers of environmental products, including renewable fuel contracts, carbon allowances, nature-based solutions, renewable energy certificates as well as the wealth of climate data and related into season analytics. We are excited about the many future growth opportunities that lie ahead. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. Our comprehensive platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth and delivered another year of record revenues in 2022. This strong growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenue growth, again a testament to the strategic diversification of our business and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments.  Rising market uncertainty and interest rates are driving an increase in demand for credit protection, and we have seen this lead to increasing trading activity in our bonds business. These factors, coupled with our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bonds platforms, continued to record full year revenues -- to record revenues in our ICE Bonds business in 2022 up nearly 100% year-over-year. Turning now to our Mortgage business, increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. Our ability to capture this secular trend is evidenced by the strength and resiliency of our recurring revenues, which increased 16% in 2022. This continued strength is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate this analog to digital conversion. As mortgage origination volumes have normalized, customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation. In the fourth quarter, we had our strongest quarter of last year in terms of sales to new customers of our loan origination system with wins across each major segment we service.  In addition, there continues to be increased interest in our data and analytics products, which increased 31% in the quarter and 24% for the full year in 2022. Through our AIQ solution and analyzer tools customers can save thousands of dollars per loan by leveraging our data and analytics tools to drive automation in the loan manufacturing process. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders, and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion.  I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Rich, it's Ben. Great question. To start, you got to remember that gas used to be a commodity that was highly dependent upon wellheads and pipeline infrastructure. So supply chains used to be a natural gas, very attached to that type of infrastructure. And whenever there was a disruption to that type of infrastructure, it's very difficult to adjust to rebalance those supply chains is all very localized, not really a global energy product. Fast forward to today, natural gas is very much a global energy product. It's a global energy supply chain, especially with the advent of LNG. And today, LNG can be freely flowed pretty much anywhere around the world as long as there's regasification capacity to do this. We saw this many years ago, and we've been investing in a global natural gas business that provides benchmarks around the world, has LNG contracts around the world that continue to expand as well as LNG freight contracts. So if you look at last year in GTF specifically, you had the unfortunate event where Russia invades Ukraine, and we saw significant energy supply disruptions where Russia was a significant supplier of oil, gas oil and natural gas, in particular, to Europe. And those supplies were effectively cut off. It created a very difficult trading situation for many of our market participants. At the same time, we saw market data subscriptions continue to grow in that part of our business. We saw more and more high balls and more of our community was growing around this. Fast forward to 2023, those supply chains have readjusted because natural gas is now a global commodity. And you have a significant amount of U.S. LNG and Middle Eastern LNG flowing now to Europe, backfilling a lot of those lost Russian gas supplies. So this market clarity has helped bolster confidence in trading products like ETF, and you see it already year open interest is up 10%. Volumes are up roughly 4% off of a comp of last year, which was actually pretty strong for TTF at the beginning of the year. Now for gas specifically, you have all kinds of macroeconomic environments that people need to manage risk around right now, but it's important to point out these are tradable events. Things like regasification coming online in Europe, so there's more and more gas that can come into Europe more efficiently. You've got storage -- gas storage facilities across Europe that have been filled.  Weather so far hasn't been an issue this year in Europe. European demand is down. So you have a potential for a recession that's looming. Chinese demand last year in '22 was down with the economy, for all intents and purposes, closed, and now it's reopening. And for the first time last year in '22, it's the first time that natural gas and LNG physical supplies into China is likely to reduce since the early '80s. So now with the reopening, what is that going to mean?  And then you also have a move towards a cleaner environment, where natural gas being the cleanest of the fossil fuels continues to be in high demand. These are all macroeconomic environments that can be tradable. They are all things that people can forecast around. And we feel great about the position that we have with the business that we've built to help traders manage around that, and we continue to invest in new contracts in the LNG space, few basis contracts in Europe around that. Now on price caps, I have mentioned on the last call, I went through a whole bunch of different issues that price caps can introduce around the difficulty you can create for people to manage and trade risk. ESMA has even come out recently with a comment that the unfortunate consequences of a price cap can be making it difficult for people to manage risk. Now for the aforementioned factors that I mentioned, the price of TTF has come way down. And the price cap right now is set at north of 3 times where TTF is trading. But that said, these can create issues for our market participants. So what we've decided to do is we're launching a new TTF contract in the U.K., it's a look-alike to the one we have in the Netherlands now, to provide customers a choice.  It's important to point out that, that TTF contract is going to trade alongside another TTF contract that we already have in the U.K. called the TTF frontline. It's a U.S. dollar-denominated contract that's oftentimes used as a basis contract to trade LNG cargoes because those are also U.S. dollar-denominated. And all those contracts cleared in the U.K. already. So we already have a community of traders that are attached to us in the U.K. for that. And it's a hedge. If they decide to use it, great. At a minimum for us, it provides us a free market price discovery mechanism to manage risk in our clearing house and to settle contracts. Thanks, Ken. It's Ben. Great question. And yes, you're right. You had the same dynamic that I highlighted before on TTF with oil as well as downstream products like gas oil as well, to some degree, getting cut off from Europe. But we have seen a similar dynamic that I mentioned in the natural gas markets where you have U.S., Norway and Middle Eastern oil now flowing in to help address some of that supply that has been lost based on Russia effectively cutting that off. So what we have seen -- since we announced in the second half of last year, that Russian molecules were no longer deliverable into the gas oil contract as an example. One of the things that we saw develop underneath the covers is that open interest in gas oil from October 1 to the end of last year grew 100% in deliveries starting in January of this year. And then since the end of the year, it's grown another 14%. So all that is showing the underlying health of the return and bolstering of market confidence coming back to products like gas oil, once that specificity was created. That said, you have a whole -- so we're seeing market confidence come back. Brent's up as well since the beginning of the year. So we feel good about that contract. Our Brent options contract has also done very well. But all of these supply chain changes around the world is why we've been making the investments we've had in a whole bunch of different areas around oil over the last few years. Two years ago, we've announced and launched ICE Futures Abu Dhabi and the Murban contract. And the interesting development we've seen with Murban is that Murban historically priced Middle Eastern barrels going out to Asia. And now, as I mentioned, Middle Eastern oil is also backfilling, to some degree, some of the supply cuts happen from Russia on oil supplies. And we're seeing Murban now being used to price Middle Eastern barrels that are going into Europe. That's one of the things that's feeding north of a 50% growth in Murban year-to-date this year. So we're off to a great start there. The Midland WTI contract that you highlighted, we launched that contract a year ago. And that contract is off to a great start. Tons of physical traders in it, prices, Midland TI that goes to Houston and hits the water and a lot of that oil is going over to Europe, it's a perfect product for people to use to hedge cargoes that are going into Europe. And again, with that supply chain dynamic of U.S. oil, backfilling a lot of the Russian oil that was cut off, we were very well positioned there. And then at the midpoint of this year, that Midland contract is perfectly positioned to be traded in parallel to Brent with those Midland TI barrels coming into the Brent index. So we feel very well positioned with all of the investments we've been making in and around oil in anticipation of potential supply chain changes, and we think we're well positioned there for growth. Thank you. Thank you for the question. Great question. And I always highlight, and it's important to point out, that we're looking to build this business and build some fundamental building blocks that enable this business to grow 8% to 10% over a long period of time. And you're right. So we've made a very concerted effort. One of the big cornerstones of that strategy is a concerted move to move transaction revenue more and more towards subscription to make the business model much more predictable underneath that.  And we feel good about the fact that we've been able to grow subscription revenue in the fourth quarter of 9% given the backdrop of an environment where volumes were down 60% and sequentially, they were down 20% approximately. So in that environment, we're still able to grow it. And I'll be the first to highlight, the mortgage industry didn't expect the downturn to happen as fast as it did or as rapidly and as deep as it did. So we have seen with some of our clients that are coming up for renewal. We've seen some clients consolidate, gone through M&A on true business. And so we've seen some cancellations due to those factors. That has created some headwinds into the business. But offsetting that, we've had a number of different items that have enabled us to grow and give us confidence in the ability to grow the business going forward. The first thing is that of the renewals we had last quarter, north of 60% of them renewed at higher subscription rates than they did at the beginning of the quarter due to our strategy to intentionally shift more transaction revenue towards subscription and also success in cross-selling more clients -- more products to our clients. The second is we had a very strong quarter and encompassed sales. In fact, the strongest quarter that we had of all of 2022 was in the fourth quarter. And we've seen that in a couple of different areas. So we saw it across all the different segments that we cover. So I think of banks, non-bank originators, brokers, credit unions. But we also saw a lot of new start-up companies coming to us.  So with the unfortunate backdrop of people getting downsized in this mortgage environment, several of those impacted employees are becoming entrepreneurs, starting up their own mortgage shops. And we're very well positioned to win that business, albeit it may be at a lower subscription fee to start, but we have the ability to grow with them as this mortgage market will snap back at some point in time. We also see, just looking out into the future that there's a lot of large banks, large -- a lot of large home lending banks that have legacy infrastructure in-house systems that they've been running for years that are looking to upgrade and replace that.  We think our funnel reflects that, and we feel really good about the prospects that those companies are looking to continue to make investments here in 2023, which will lead to growth factors for us going into the future. So that's a little bit of color of what happened in the fourth quarter as well as why we feel good about our prospects going forward. Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. And we feel really, really great about the position we have in the environmental marketplace. As you know, we were here very, very early. Almost 13 years ago is when we acquired the Climate Exchange, and that was really the foundational piece to it. And we've been building and investing around this the entire time since we've owned that and now have the most global complete suite of solutions there that are helping our clients price carbon, offset their carbon risks, trade renewable energy credits, et cetera. And one of the other strengths that we have to our environmental business is that there's a symbiotic relationship that we see with energy. A lot of people that are producing energy or consuming energy need to care about the price of carbon. So we see a symbiotic relationship there. For our business, if you look under the covers of what was going on last year in 2022, we did see some headwinds, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, on the European Union allowance markets. And a lot of that was associated to time, capital and attention being paid towards the energy markets. That said, we continue to see market data subscriptions, in particular, environmentals, are growing nicely over the years. So we continue to have people added into our community between our market data, between our ICE instant messaging platform and chat platform. We continue to grow visibility and interest into our markets there. I'd also point out that the European Union late last year reaffirmed the trading scheme and continue to signal that things like free allowance thresholds, so the amount of carbon that you're allowed to emit before you have to buy allowance, all those are going to start coming down, which means that more carbon is going to need to be priced and more sectors of the economy are going to be captured. So from a long term looking out over the horizon perspective, that's a tailwind of growth. We launched our U.K. allowance platform. That was up nicely last year, up 16% and North America, as I had mentioned, had a record last year of almost 3.7 million lots traded with a record number of market participants in there. Our regi contracts, which is regional greenhouse gas emissions California carbon allowances, renewable fuels all had a great year. We continue to invest here by launching new contracts. We launched tech wind solar contracts last year, and we also launched a few tranches of nature-based offsets. One of the things that we announced at the end of last year that may have flown under the radar for people is when you look at the offset market in the carbon and environmental credit markets, those markets tend to be called voluntary, and they are very nascent. Those are markets that no one has really been able to effectively develop yet, and they're all in very, very early stages. One of the key problems we think that there is from our experience in developing other markets is that there's a fundamental -- fundamentally very difficult for somebody to understand what is the offset that one would want to trade. What is the underlying reference data associated to it? What are the components that make up that offset or that environmental credit? What's the quality of that credit? Basic supply information like how much was issued when it was originally issued, how much has been retired and how much still exists. So we launched, at the end of the year, a reference data service where our community of over 100,000 instant messaging and chat clients that are traders that are utilizing that all day long, they're energy traders, they're environmental market traders can instantly look up any offset, any environmental credit, be able to get all of the reference data associated to that credit; how much was issued when it was issued;, how much has been expired, how much is still available to trade, this is all basic fundamental supply data that people need to be able to price -- fundamentally price the contract. So we pulled all that together, so you can gather all that information on a near real-time basis. We pulled it together from a variety of different sources to make what was hours worth of work, if not days, can be done instantaneously. And obviously, with that information, it can help with price formation and eventually interaction with our community to help identify people that would want to trade.  So we feel great about our positioning there. We're investing there, and that's just one significant example of a nascent market that we think we have some foundational elements that we're so excited about. Sure. Simon, it's Ben. So there's a couple of different pieces to that question that I'll cover. So on transaction revenue, we have said we are willing to give up some transaction revenue that we have today. So take, for example, a \"success\" fee. When a loan is codified, there's a transactional fee associated to that, that where -- if we lower that to some degree for our clients but shift more of that towards recurring revenue and more predictable revenue to us, we'll do that. So there is some short-term impact to our transaction -- to existing transaction revenues. At the same time, we have a whole suite of other services that we're cross-selling to our stable of 3,000 Encompass customers, for example, around the world, some of which are recurring, some of which are transaction that, as those continue to mature because they're very early stages but are showing some great signs of success, our ability to cross-sell those, things like our data and analytics offerings, which we -- were transactions that we've tilted much more towards subscription. But then we also have services in our closing line item that we're continuing to invest in and we're continuing to add on that will be incremental transaction revenues. So there's a mix underneath the covers there. But we believe that having a more predictable business model for the longer term will enable us to continue to grow the business at 8% to 10% a year for a long period of time. Thanks for the question, Craig. So a lot of what we saw in terms of sales strength, so I'll just -- I'll talk about 2022 first, then I'll go in the fourth quarter. So for 2022 as a whole, our AIQ, that -- the automation service that's lowering the cost of manufacturing a loan to our clients was very strong throughout the entire year and each quarter. We had a good quarter in selling new clients onto that platform. Again, that's hopefully lowering their cost of manufacturing along a lot of the comments that Jeff made before. And hopefully, those cost savings get passed on to the end consumer. In the fourth quarter, it was an interesting dynamic. It was actually our -- the core Encompass product that drove that sales strength that we had in the fourth quarter. So what we're seeing is that, while you do have customers that are consolidating, you have some M&A, you have some downsizing that's happening with that client mix. The two things that we see in parallel are that, one, a lot of the banks credit unions, non-bank originators, they're using this time to invest in infrastructure.  So if they have in-house systems, for example, which is often what we're unseating, they're looking to invest in their infrastructure to be ready for when this market snaps back. Looking at our funnel going forward, we know that a lot of the big banks are looking at that, that infrastructure that they have and looking at making investments to position them well when the market snaps back. And then the other thing that we're seeing is, as I mentioned, as employees are impacted by these downsizings. We're seeing a lot of them start new shops. And as entrepreneurs, they're starting new shops, and we're well positioned to win that business as well.  So we're very well positioned across the entire spectrum. And people are taking -- we see people taking advantage of the opportunity right now where there is a strain in the system to invest and be ready for when the market comes back. Thank you, Michael. It's Ben. And it's a mix on it. You hit on some of the elements in the way you asked the question. So our view has been that when you have this significant stable of customers, the 3,000 lenders that are on our platform and utilizing our services, there's a tremendous opportunity to cross-sell.  And one of the things that's really driving that recurring revenue growth is the success we have in continuing to sell our AIQ platform into that customer base. We have a long way to go in being able to penetrate those 3,000 lenders and be able to provide them the efficiency that they need now more than ever. So we feel good about our ability to cross-sell and how we've executed on it to date since we acquired, the former Ellie Mae business and looking forward ahead into the future. The other thing is new sales. So we continue to have great success adding new customers. Customers can come on and utilize that AIQ, offering those analysis to other third-party providers. So we continue to have success there. And we also continue to add new customers on to Encompass. And I just answered a question on that. A couple of questions that go here. So we continue to have great success in the Encompass for all the different segments that we sell through. Whether it's a start-up company, whether it's an established non-bank originator, whether it's a bank or a credit union, we're a broker across the entire spectrum, we believe the investments we've made in our platform is very well positioned to meet those clients' needs. And as we see a lot of the major home lenders in the U.S. looking to replace in-house legacy infrastructure, we think we're also very well placed to win that business as well. So those are the key drivers -- as well as it's having very relatively low attrition. We are a core platform for operating these businesses. So unless they're going out of business or there's M&A that's happening, we're not losing business."

            "name": "Jeff Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. I want to begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. As communicated, when making the announcement, we continued to believe that this transaction will close during the first half of this year.  Our respect for the Federal Trade Commission's work on this matter, and as we cooperate with them to gain regulatory approval, we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly, we remain excited about the efficiencies that the combined entities will bring to the end consumer and to other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem. In that vein, and shifting to what was yet another successful year, 2022 marked our 17th consecutive year of record revenues, record operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. This track record of growth reflects on the quality of our strategy and, more importantly, on the execution of that strategy. We've intentionally diversified across asset classes and geographies, so that we're not tied to any one cyclical trend or macroeconomic environment. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues to provide upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. We've placed the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog to digital conversion. The combination of these factors is what has made ICE an all-weather name and a business model that provides upside to volatility with less downside risk and, importantly, a business model that generates growth on top of growth. For example, in 2022, inflationary concerns and market speculation of central bank activity benefited our European and U.K. interest rate business, driving a 33% increase in revenues for the full year. These conditions also contributed to record full year revenues in our credit default swap clearing business, up 61% year-over-year, as rate volatility drove increased demand for risk management and credit protection. Across our mortgage business, even against this backdrop of rising interest rates, our business outperformed the broader market driven by strong recurring revenue growth, up 16% for the full year. Again, this is a reflection of the all-weather nature of our business model.  As we look to 2023 and beyond, we're positioned to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes, and we remain focused on executing on the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, extending our track record of growth. I'd like to conclude by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2022, and I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to the best year in our company's history.  And with that, I'll turn the call back over to our operator, Alex, who will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time. And I think if you step back -- this is Jeff. If you step back, what we're talking to the industry about is a fundamental shift in the way they assemble and manufacture mortgages to take costs out of the system, to move the industry to more of a SaaS model, subscription-based model instead of a model where every single mortgage is put together a la carte with services and the cost of a first-time homebuyers mortgage versus the cost of a $1 million mortgage are essentially the same in the current system. And it just makes sense to us that if we can give the industry a more predictable way of operating their businesses, they can be more responsive to their customers and allocate costs proportionately across their business, which is the way business is done in most other digital markets or markets that have moved from analog to digital. And this is Jeff. I would just mention that we spend a tremendous amount of time focused on our own costs and the cost of delivering these products and continue to make prudent investments but underneath allocate to personnel and resources.  We've been -- you may notice, of all the major exchange groups, we've been the most cautious, if you will, of moving business to the cloud because those are areas where we've seen the largest cost increases and the most unpredictable rises in cost. So we have continued to be conservative in delivering our products the way our customers want to see them but trying to do it in a way that is very, very cost efficient. Well, thank you, Alex. Thank you all for joining us here this morning. We are continuing to innovate for our customers and build an all-weather business model and delivery growth. And so with that, I hope you'll have a great day and appreciate your being with us."

            "name": "Lynn Martin",
            "content": "Hi, Dan, this is Lynn. I'm just going to jump in with a bit more color on what Warren said. I think this segment, in particular, really illustrates the all-weather nature of the ICE name. And the ability for this segment to grow 13% in spite of some of the challenges Warren has highlighted really underpin that.  If you look at the execution side of the business, volatility has certainly been a tailwind, but importantly, new products and new customer acquisition has also been driver of our growth, new products in the CDS clearing side of the business, including our CDS options.  In terms of ICE bonds, we've actually been able to grow our institutional market share. Institutional business in the muni asset class, in particular, is up 205% in Q4 alone, 175% for the full year. And we've been able to gain in muni about 650 basis points of share in 2022, really driven by the work we've done with the institutions to plug into their workflows. Now obviously, some of the macro forces have impacted the fixed income and data and analytics line, as Warren highlighted, slightly slower sales cycle in our pricing business. AUM trends driving out of our higher capture products into our lower fee capture products. But I would be remiss if I didn't talk about the outsized performance of our other data services line, where we haven't seen a slowdown in the sales cycle. And this was really fueled by demand for capacity, which was up 18% in the quarter, double-digit growth in our desktop and derivatives analytics businesses as well as strong growth in our fees business. So I think when you take a step back and look at the segment overall, we couldn't be more optimistic about the ability for that segment, in particular, to grow, compounding in a variety of macroeconomic positions because of the all-weather nature of the name. Yes. Thanks for the question. As I mentioned, volatility certainly did help out this business, but a lot of the share gains we've achieved in the institutional side of the business has really been what's driving the growth. 26% in Q4 of our muni activity came from institutional accounts. So that's up from 13% in 2020 when we started to acquire all of these different platforms. So we've really been able to increased institutional footprint. We do see opportunities also in treasuries and CDs. Those two asset classes within the execution segment have outperformed a lot of that volatility-driven. But the toughest thing to do is to get the plumbing into the institutional accounts. And I think the deliberate decisions we took a couple of years ago to be workflow-agnostic, to work with a variety of providers to plumb our platforms into a variety of workflow solutions have really beared fruit in 2022. So when volatility came into the market, it wasn't just about your traditional retail trader that was executing the munis and corporates. It's now about the institutional trader that sees us as a diversified platform across multiple asset classes in fixed income."

[Operator Instructions] I'll now hand over to your host, Katia Gonzalez, Investor Relations Senior Analyst, to begin. Katia, please go ahead.\nKatia Gonzalez: Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2022 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2021 Form 10-K, third quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. In addition, as we announced in May, ICE has agreed to acquire Black Knight. The transaction is pending customary regulatory approval and we expect to close in the first half of 2023. In connection with the proposed transaction, ICE has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of ICE common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction. The registration statement includes a proxy statement of Black Knight that also constitutes a prospectus of ICE. Please see the Form S-4 filing for additional information regarding the transaction. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $1.31 which is on top of 30% growth in the third quarter of 2021 and marked the best third quarter in our company's history. Third quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year. While transaction revenues were flat on a year-over-year basis, our recurring revenues which accounted for over half of our business, increased by 6% with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $727 million and were $16 million below the low end of our guidance. These better-than-expected results were driven by favorable FX trends, continued operating efficiencies and a handful of nonrecurring items within professional services, SG&A and technology. Shifting to the fourth quarter. We now expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $730 million to $740 million, with the increase relative to the third quarter largely reflecting the reversal of onetime items. As you begin to think about 2023 expenses, the midpoint of our current full year guidance or roughly $2.948 billion is a reasonable base to build upon. Despite the dynamic and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, the diversity and importantly, durability of our business has enabled us to invest through cycles. And while taking the current inflationary backdrop into consideration, we expect to once again invest in our people and the many medium- and long-term growth opportunities that exist across our expanded business. Third quarter adjusted operating income totaled $1.1 billion, up over 6% year-over-year and is on top of 13% pro forma growth in 2021, while adjusted operating margin expanded by nearly 180 basis points to approximately 60%. Through the first 3 quarters of 2022, adjusted free cash flow has totaled over $2.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Now, let's move to Slide 5 where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter Exchange net revenues totaled $1 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. In addition to higher levels of collateral at our clearinghouses and thus higher member interest revenues, this strong performance was driven by a 54% increase in our interest rate futures, a 23% increase in our equity derivatives and a 13% increase in cash equities and options revenues. Importantly, total open interest which we believe to be the best indicator of longer-term growth, ended October up 11% versus the end of last year, including 7% growth in energy and 18% growth across our financial futures and options complex. Recurring revenues increased by 5% year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong demand for our energy exchange data and a continued benefit from our record 2021 listings performance. While recent market volatility has led to a pause in new Listings business, both the backlog and our conversations with potential partners remains robust. And through the end of October, a record 19 corporations, representing a combined market cap of nearly $40 billion, have chosen to transfer to the NYSE. Turning now to Slide 6. In our Fixed Income and Data Services segment, third quarter revenues totaled a record $534 million, a 14% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 84%, including 122% growth in ICE bonds and 75% growth in our CDS clearing business. Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was driven by market volatility and rising interest rates, customers allocating additional capital to CDS trading and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms. Recurring revenues, excluding the Euronext migration, grew by 4% in the quarter driven by demand for additional capacity on the ICE Global Network as well as double-digit growth in both our consolidated feeds business and our derivative analytics. Somewhat offsetting the strength were asset-based revenues in our index business which declined by double digits year-over-year as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets such as equities, munis and corporate bonds and into treasury ETFs. In addition, extended fixed income market volatility is also impacting growth in a portion of our end-of-day fixed income pricing business as reduced new issuance has driven slower growth in the number of outstanding bonds available to be priced. Absent a sharp reversal of these macro trends, we'd expect fourth quarter growth to be similar to our third quarter performance. Shifting to Mortgage Technology on Slide 7. Third quarter revenues totaled $276 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for nearly 60% of segment revenues and totaled a record $163 million in the quarter, increased 14% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% decline in origination volumes. Importantly, data and analytics revenue increased 22% year-over-year with underlying recurring revenue increasing by over 40%. Similar to last quarter, it's worth noting that industry unit origination volumes were similar to those in the first quarter of 2019. However, our third quarter 2022 Mortgage Technology revenues were over $100 million greater, growing at a CAGR of approximately 17% when compared to the pro forma revenues in 1Q '19. This is a clear testament to the continued automation and growth and customer adoption of our solutions across the origination workflow. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8. Year-to-date, we've grown ICE revenue by 6%, adjusted operating income by 10% and our adjusted earnings per share by 9%, representing the best year-to-date performance in our company's history. Despite dramatically different macroeconomic environments, over a 3-year period, you will see a similar story of compounding growth with ICE revenues increasing at a CAGR of 8%, operating income at 11% and EPS of 12%, again, a testament to the resilience and durability of our platform and the all-weather nature of our business model. As we look to the balance of this year -- of the year, we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us and remain focused on creating value for our stockholders. With that, I'll hand it over to Ben.\nBen Jackson: Thank you, Warren and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. In our financial markets, rising inflation and central bank activity across Europe and the U.K. continued to drive increased hedging activity with interest rate average daily volumes increasing 40% year-over-year in the third quarter, including record Euribor futures. In our equity derivatives complex, ADV in our MSCI complex was up 17% in the third quarter as volatility levels continue to be elevated versus the prior year. In our energy markets, the third quarter was marked with the confluence of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that, when combined with high price volatility, made for a difficult trading environment. Despite these uncertain conditions, we have seen strength in areas like our options markets, our North American gas business and our North American environmental complex. Options contracts are a valuable tool in highly uncertain market conditions due to the ability to manage geopolitical tail risk and the lower associated capital requirements as we've seen historically. With open interest up 29% versus the end of last year, we are pleased that our customers continue to turn to our deep liquid options markets to manage their risk. The evolving energy supply chain in Europe is increasing the demand for global liquefied natural gas sourced from the United States, driving price volatility in our North American gas markets. Our commercial customers continue to rely on our markets to manage their risk, contributing to a 23% volume growth in our North American gas business year-to-date and an all-time record in North American gas open interest as we have gained 500 basis points of market share over the past year versus our peers. Finally, although our European carbon markets are seeing headwinds due to the aforementioned factors, we continue to see growth in active participants in this market with participation up 7% year-over-year. At the same time, the secular trend towards cleaner energy is also driving growth in our North American environmental markets with volumes up 6% year-over-year in the third quarter. And because we offer the broadest suite of environmental products across the carbon cycle, we remain excited about our position to serve customers as they navigate the journey to cleaner energy and as the demand for transparent pricing in carbon grows. Importantly, as we look out over the longer term, we believe that the 3 secular drivers across our energy markets remain intact: First, increasing energy demand; second, an evolving energy supply chain; and third, the clean energy transition. And because we operate deep liquid markets across the globe with benchmarks in emerging markets across every source of energy, we feel very well positioned to benefit from these factors. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business; we delivered record revenues which grew 14% year-over-year. Our comprehensive fixed income and data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth underpinned by both our recurring and transaction revenues, a testament to the strategic diversification of our business model and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments. Turning now to our Mortgage business. In the third quarter, our Mortgage business once again outperformed the broader industry driven by strong recurring revenues. The strength and resiliency that we've seen in recurring revenues has been driven by our new customers continuing to adopt our digital solutions, increased demand for our data and analytics tools and continued strong retention. Our customers remain focused on automation and efficiencies. This focus has led to increased interest in our data and analytics products, contributing to a 22% growth year-to-date in our data and analytics business. Through our AIQ solution and analyzer tools, customers can save thousands of dollars per loan by leveraging our artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to drive automation in the loan manufacturing process. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to leverage our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Ben. I want to start my prepared remarks by highlighting our vision of how ICE is contributing to both the U.S. home mortgage and U.S. equity markets to bring increased efficiencies to consumers in these 2 asset classes. To take you back, ICE was initially founded to build and operate digital commodity exchanges. Modern digital exchanges provide an essential service, efficiently matching buyers and sellers with operational neutrality. Our modern exchanges are regulated. But more importantly, their growth and efficacy depend on the industry's trust of our neutrality. ICE does not take a position on the price of any commodity or security. We simply provide the software and network that efficiently facilitates a buyer and seller finding one another and allows them to determine their transaction price. Today, millions of traders, investors, brokers and regulators around the world are attached to our exchange networks. And they all benefit from the transparency and standardization that we enable. We followed up our launch into the exchange business by building digital data networks to disperse information separate from our exchanges, networks that thrive on the neutrality and confidentiality of our data management. It is likely obvious to you that our data networks would contain financial information generated by our own exchanges but it may be less obvious that our growth has been accelerated by opening these networks to third parties, including most of our global exchange competitors who also access our customer base. Today, hundreds of third-party exchanges, brokers and market data generators publish their data to users across our networks. Our growth in the U.S. mortgage industry builds on the same management tenets: trust, transparency and neutrality. Our mortgage software and network are open and impartial. ICE has been at the forefront of building a mortgage platform so that industry participants can better communicate with one another, reduce their costs, pass these savings on to consumers in the form of better prices and appropriately implement the government's homeownership policies. And it is in this vein that we have agreed to acquire Black Knight to connect their market participants to ours, open up its platform, reduce cost per mortgage origination, overlay the safety and soundness practices that we've developed for businesses like the systemically important New York Stock Exchange and create new products and services for lenders to increase homeownership, including in underserved communities. As a part of the budget that we previously guided you to, ICE plans a significant financial outlay to open and upgrade the Black Knight technology stack, a commitment that we believe would have been hard for Black Knight's other potential acquirers to make potentially in a contracting mortgage environment. This is the same strategy and commitment that we made when taking over the Mortgage Electronic Registrations System which today has durable and scalable operations and technology built by ICE, systems that are prepared to manage the difficult risk environments in the U.S. housing market. And as shown on Slide 10, these MERS processes can identify and deregister failed lending firms who become zombies to borrowers and regulators. You may have recently heard Sandra Thompson, the Federal Housing Finance Agency's Director, lamenting how stakeholders in the mortgage manufacturing process seemingly lack the will to adopt technology that changes their entrenched methods. This is precisely the challenge that ICE is laser-focused on solving. Gillian Tett pointed out in her book, The Silo Effect, that the U.S. mortgage industry is so siloed that the federal government's past attempts to help troubled homeowners stay in their homes by reducing mortgage payments actually exacerbated the foreclosure problem because lenders lowered monthly payments and servicers mistook this as consumers falling behind and initiated foreclosure proceedings. As Austin Gulsby once said, the silos were so strong, they did the exact opposite of what everyone expected. With the explosive growth of the fintech industry over the last decade, the U.S. has seen a dramatic upsurge in the number of alternative home lenders and mortgage technology providers who, like ICE, are building solutions to benefit lenders and borrowers. Slide 10 also shows the number of new lending firms that just this year have registered to do business with MERS. And surprisingly, the number of lending firms have increased in a year where consumer demand for mortgages has decreased. This increased lender competition presents opportunities for ICE to take costs out of the mortgage manufacturing process so that these lenders can compete more effectively, passing no savings on to borrowers. The high cost of manufacturing and funding a home mortgage that we target are particularly acute for the most marginalized borrowers which further exacerbates the wealth divide in the United States. Our acquisition of Black Knight remains subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission. ICE has provided the FTC with extensive information and certified its completeness. And as is often customary, we agreed to extend the FTC's statutory review period and intend to continue ICE's cooperation with the FTC staff. Our estimate is that the Black Knight merger will close in the first half of next year. While we'll be unable to answer any questions on this call relating to our transaction with Black Knight, please note that our participation in this FTC review, coupled with the comprehensive conversations that we've been having with our customer base, has further convinced us that our merger will afford significant benefits to U.S. homeowners and industry stakeholders. And while on the subject of regulators, I'd like to comment on the recent remarks from the Securities and Exchange Commission focused on the structure of the U.S. equities market. In his June 8 speech, Chair Gensler noted the key elements of the national market system rules haven't been updated since year 2005. And since that time, the U.S. equity markets have become increasingly opaque. Today, most retail order flow is executed through off-exchange bilateral trading relationships with a small number of wholesalers. These wholesalers are able to trade against customers without exposing those orders to competition. In some cases, wholesalers pay retail brokers for the privilege of this first look at their clients' order flow. This practice is known as price improvement and it refers to occasions where trade is made at prices better than the national best bid and offer ticker displayed by the public exchanges, trades that often contain fractions less than 1 whole penny per share. What's often left out of this price improvement narrative, however, is the fact that public exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange under current SEC rules are actually prohibited from displaying orders at price increments less than 1 whole penny. As a result, public investors are, in fact, prevented from narrowing the national best bid and offer ticker to sub-penny price increments. But ask yourself this; is the national best bid and offer ticker really the best market price that we should all be relying upon if investors can routinely buy a share of stock cheaper than what's displayed? We measure the opportunity for investor price improvement savings to the tune of $1.8 billion a year if there were a simple harmonization of the quote and trade increments across the entire market. We hope that this opportunity will be considered by the SEC. ICE has been consistent in its strategy of promoting standardization, fair, transparent markets and networks using state-of-the-art technology. We embrace opportunities to transform businesses to create efficiencies and lower customer costs, not only in home mortgage but even in a 230-year-old business like the New York Stock Exchange. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 11. The third quarter of this year has been marked by rising inflation, fluctuating interest rates and central bank activity, concerns over energy and food security and global political uncertainty. And I can't think of any firm that has been better positioned to help manage these risks than ICE. Our customers rely on our data, technology and liquid markets to navigate through this environment. In the third quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share. These record-setting third quarter results against our extraordinary third quarter results of last year reflect the all-weather nature of our business model. We have intentionally positioned the company to provide customer solutions in numerous geographies and economic conditions to facilitate all-weather results. I'd like to end by thanking our customers for their continued business and their trust. And I want to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to this record third quarter following up on our unsurpassed first half results. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Charlie. And we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Richard Repetto of Piper Sandler.\nRichard Repetto: First, thanks for the comparison one on the Mortgage Technology performance versus unit originations. That's helpful. But as we dig in, you outperformed again against unit origination. Can you give us a little bit more detail on which lines in the -- outperform like data analytics, we'd expect that to be 100% recurring and that's been outperforming. But like the other has been flat and we expect that to be all variable. So the question is what's getting you to outperform the unit originations and within which lines in mortgage?\nBen Jackson: Sure. Rich, it's Ben. So as you can appreciate, our whole hypothesis on this deal and what we've been doing in the mortgage space is all directed towards a long-term view of taking one of the most analog asset classes that there are and turning it digital. And that's what we believe over the long term, it will enable us to achieve that 8% to 10% growth. And the contributors underneath that are really -- we're very focused on product innovation and in particular, helping our lender customers, lower cost become more efficient. And as we do that, we're hoping that the savings that those lenders achieve are then brought down to their clients, the end consumer and will translate into better selection. It will help to lower cost for the end consumer. It will help enable them to get the best products at the most efficient prices to meet their needs and achieve the dream of homeownership. So that's from a long-term perspective what our focus has been and where we're making our investments. Overall, what's driving our ability to beat is the intentional shift towards subscription revenue. So if you look across each of the segments that we have, we're pushing very hard to move more and more of the revenue in each of those reporting segments more towards subscription when we can. And one of the things I'll highlight in terms of success this last quarter, even with all the headwinds that the industry has had, 2/3 of the customers that renewed in the third quarter renewed at higher subscription base levels by the end of that quarter than they were at, at the beginning of the quarter. The other thing I'd say is that it is -- it has been a difficult environment. It has been a difficult environment. And despite that, we only saw a single -- small single-digit percentage of our clients not renew and most of that's due to M&A industry consolidation and closing up shop. But one of the things we've seen as a positive for us with some of the backdrop of this industry consolidation as some of these companies and their employees have been downsized, some of these impacted personnel have used it as an opportunity to become an entrepreneur and start a new lending shop. And those are opportunities that we compete for and we've won some of that business on Encompass this past quarter. So we've seen sales success in origination on Encompass, both in the smaller start-up companies, the mid-market as well as banks. So that said, a lot of what's going on in our origination process, our origination line item and reporting line item as well as the fact as we've moved more and more of that revenue to our subscription and we have very low attrition. In the data and analytics area, what's really fueling our ability to beat there is the same. So data and analytics does have historically a transaction element to it. We have been moving this line item very similar to our origination line item more and more towards subscription as clients renew. And as we sign new clients, make sure that we're tilting those deals much more towards subscription revenue. And the big piece of products that we have in that area is a product called AIQ. That's the product that's automating a lot of the underwriting processes and that's a big area of where today, we're generating around $1,400 of savings in originating a loan. A lot of it is anchored in this area of automating the underwriting process for our customers. I mentioned that in the second quarter, we signed JPMorgan Chase that's going through an implementation on this. And this quarter, we had several wins across different segments that we sell to from banks, nonbanks and credit unions. And we had a significant win with loanDepot this past quarter which they, like many lenders, are trying to get the efficiencies that we -- that our platform will provide to them. So that's a little bit of a flavor in some of the segments of what we see under the covers.\nRichard Repetto: My follow-up question would be in the Exchange segment. And I don't know whether it's for Jeff or Ben but the energy complex, not just you, industry-wide continues at least to perplex a lot of us with the volume performance there. And again, it's not just you, it's industry. But Jeff or Ben, could you give us a little bit more insight into -- you're making up a good part of the volumes, growing financial futures and cash equities and options. But like the gas oil contract, I believe it's down 40% year-over-year and this idea of higher margin causing corporates and speculators to pull back. Could you give us some more color into the energy complex, specifically gas oil?\nBen Jackson: Sure. Sure, Rich. It's Ben again. And you alluded to it in the way that you asked the question around the way that we manage this business is from looking at the overall portfolio and we have a wide lens on this. And we pride ourselves in having the deepest and most liquid futures markets to enable our customers to manage risk across the energy spectrum, also in the global rates environment. We manage our business as an overall portfolio and that's the nature of that all-weather aspect of our stock. In energy specifically which is where you were going, we manage even the energy segment as a portfolio. And we're proud to say that despite all these headwinds, our energy business itself, open interest is up when you look across the entire business, is up 6% since the end of last year. And this is in the backdrop of a confluence of all kinds of issues that the world is dealing with right now. You have this unfortunate war. You have on-and-off lockdowns in China. You have a push to move towards cleaner energy sources. You have underinvestment in energy infrastructure. You have major releases from the strategic petroleum reserve, all rearing their head at the same time. And we're proud that now more than ever, our clients are coming to us to manage their risk. And I'll touch on a couple of areas within energy. And you asked specifically about gas oil, so I'll touch on that as well. So broadly speaking, we positioned our business to help clients manage their transition towards a cleaner energy environment. That's why we have the most deep liquid markets around the globe in oil, natural gas, power, LNG and environmentals. In oil, we have seen some headwinds. You focused on gas oil and you're spot on. And gas oil has had some headwinds. Most of this is associated to the market needing clarity around how Russian oil deliveries into the contract would be handled because, historically, Russian oil did go into that contract. We work with governments and customers to come up with a market-based solution to this and also landed on a sanctions regime that we align to that at the end of this year, Russian oil can no longer be delivered into that contract. Once we did that and provided clarity to the market for that, we have started to see open interest rebuild in that contract in calendar year '23 and beyond. So that's a positive. It's going to take some time for that to play out but we're seeing that on the horizon. We believe that, that's going to turn the corner. Within oil itself, expanding further across what's going on in the portfolio, we've had some very positive developments. So our options contracts have done very, very well. Brent alone has seen options volume up 14% year-over-year. And part of the reason for that is that options contracts enable a trader to hedge a whole range of outcome. It enables them an efficient way to manage geopolitical risks. And there's also a little bit of a lower-margin requirement associated with these because if you're buying an option, your risk on that option is limited to the premium that you pay. So all of that's incorporated into the margin models. So we've seen a lot of success in our options markets. And we have new innovations; we continue to build our Murban contract that we launched. And we're continuing to hit records consistently with our Midland WTI Gulf Coast contract that we launched earlier this year. So we're having some good success and continue to build on that. The other area I'd touch on quickly would be natural gas. So our natural gas business, you have to again expand the lens and look at it from a global perspective. I mentioned U.S. gas is at a record and up 23% in volume. And globally, our natural gas business is up 16% and 6% in OI. And some of the inputs to that is our TTF business has seen some headwinds because Russia has historically supplied 40% of the gas to Continental Europe and the supply has effectively been cut off. But what's filling the void? U.S. LNG is filling that void for Europe. And that's fueling strength in our North American gas complex as commercial customers are trading our Henry and our basis markets significantly. And also a lot of those LNG cargoes that are going to Europe are hedged by our TTF contract, our Henry Hub contract, basis markets as well as our LNG markets. And the last thing I'd say on the gas markets is that we're innovating and working on market-based solutions with Europe as we understand the situation there. And we're -- we announced just recently, we're going to be launching some new contracts, new basis contracts in Italy, France and Germany in gas to trade alongside our existing Continental gas business and then in Northwest Europe and Southwest Europe LNG contracts that will trade alongside our JKM contract. And it's important that the feedback we're getting from our clients is that all of these contracts are likely to trade basis and relative to our TTF deep liquid price benchmark.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: I'd like to spend a little time on the old life business and the European rate complex. We've seen inflation in Europe in the highest rates in more than a decade. So maybe first, bring us back, what was the peak of revenue generation for the European rate business back when rates were much higher? And then do you think the opportunity here is bigger or smaller today for that franchise, given the underlying market? And then CME launched Ether futures, I think, earlier in the week which I think seems like your turf. So can you talk about the potential for investment in the rates business and product development? Do you think this is sort of an attractive use of resources? And what are you thinking from here?\nBen Jackson: Ken, it's Ben. I'll start here. The -- so when you look across our rates business, the way we look at it and we manage it, we manage it as a portfolio. We look at, in particular, the largest parts of our rate franchise are with our SONIA Gilts business as well as Euribor. And underneath the covers, when you look at what's been going on geopolitically and the overall environment, Continental Europe has actually done a pretty good job of signaling how they're going to handle this rates environment. And the market has responded very well to that. And that's what's led to just a very, very solid year in terms of Euribor volumes as well as open interest as that is up over 60% on a year-over-year basis. So that part of the business has done extraordinarily well. If you look at the U.K. specifically and Gilt and SONIA, there's 2 dynamics going on there. With SONIA specifically when you're comparing our performance with last year, you have to remember that last year, we had both short sterling and SONIA trading side by side. And this year -- and then those converged in December of last year. So this year, you have SONIA only. So there's a bit of an off comparison there as there was a significant amount of arbitrating going on between SONIA and short sterling as that converge into what's taking place. And now you have SONIA as a stand-alone. In the U.K., though, specifically, obviously, there's been political uncertainty there. You've had the change of Prime Ministers. You've got uncertain rate hike expectations. You had the mini budget that shocked a lot of people. You had a potential currency crisis all hitting at the same time. And that definitely weighed a little bit on SONIA and Gilt but we're already seeing signs that the market is stabilizing as the environment has stabilized there. So we feel very good about that overall rates portfolio that we have. It's definitely an area we're continuing to invest. We have our own SOFR contract that we've launched as well. And it's an area that we're going to continue to invest and we see opportunity.\nKen Worthington: Okay. If you recall the size, is there a lot of opportunity to grow it versus what it was a decade ago? Or is that sort of the peak of what you think this can be?\nWarren Gardiner: So Ken, we'll go ahead and get you the exact number there but I think it's certainly approaching where it was years and I think the record would have been sort of '08, '09, that kind of a range in terms of the revenues. We certainly made some adjustments to RPCs in that complex, too. And there has been some pressure from FX this year. So I think we're approaching to where it was and we're around this level. But I do think that the world is a lot bigger and different than it was back then. And so I think as you think about the future, there's certainly room in what is effectively -- certainly on the Euribor, so the second largest reserve currency for that complex to grow well into the future regardless of what the prior level would have been.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Daniel Fannon of Jefferies.\nDaniel Fannon: So a couple of questions just on the Fixed Income and Data business. So the execution as well as the clearing has seen pretty strong activity this year. You mentioned higher rates. Is it -- you talked about just participation levels, customer growth, other areas or are these really more just kind of external factors kind of finally more as a tailwind?\nLynn Martin: Dan, this is Lynn Martin. Thanks so much for the question. And absolutely, volatility has been a tailwind for the execution side of the business with record levels of CDS clearing so far in 2022. But what we're really -- we continue to be really excited about is the pickup of activity in our ICE bond platform where as a result of the continued Fed rate hikes, you've seen tremendous volatility in fixed income markets globally. And ICE bond is a beneficiary of some of that volatilities, particularly in our treasury, our muni, our corporate bond, our CD business where you've seen record levels of activity and volatility. In fact, activity measured on a volume perspective is almost 200% up in Q3 versus last Q3. A very important factor, though, is how we broaden out the participation in those platforms, particularly focused on institutional customers. And in Q3 alone, in our muni markets, you saw the levels of institutional participation grow by 192%. So that just continues on a trend that we've seen as a result of thinking about particularly the muni markets as an ecosystem and driving additional institutional participation across our platform.\nDaniel Fannon: Understood. And then on the data and analytics side, I think, Warren, you mentioned fourth quarter being kind of flattish with the third quarter in terms of growth and citing the, I think, lower bonds outstanding as a part -- as a factor. I guess could you remind us of the pricing model? I thought this was more of a subscription-based model, more recurring revenue associated with customers, not bonds outstanding. I guess provide a little more clarity or understanding in terms of how we think about the outstanding bond versus kind of customer growth and other things in terms of drivers of revenue.\nLynn Martin: So Dan, this is Lynn again. I think I'll start off and then turn it over to Warren. Thanks for the follow-up question because I think what you're pointing to really illustrates how we build businesses to be all-weather businesses. We talked about the volatility in the markets being a significant tailwind for our execution side of the business but it's been a bit of a headwind for our fixed income data and analytics line, whereas Warren said in his prepared remarks, if you think about our index business, we've seen assets flow out of our higher capture indices, specifically equities, corporate bonds and munis. And assets flow into indices where we have a lower capture rate, specifically our treasury indices. In fact, if you look at the AUM benchmarked against our indices, it's actually at an all-time high. But the mix has significantly changed which impacts the revenue. And as Warren said, another headwind we're seeing that's affecting the fixed income data and analytics line is the new bond issuance which looked in fixed income this year. So that has impacted the growth rate of our legacy PRD business which has continued to grow albeit at a much slower rate. That said, volatility, again, has been a tailwind for the other part of our data services, particularly our other data services line where you see various factors increasing to what we believe is outsized growth in that line, including 22% increase in demand for capacity in our ICE Global Network as volatility continues to require customers to have reliable, resilient connectivity and higher bandwidth connectivity, double-digit growth in our consolidated feeds business, double-digit growth in our data analytics business which provides transparency to opaque asset classes and outsized growth in our desktop platform, specifically our chat platforms as ways that customers interact with our market continue to modernize.\nWarren Gardiner: And Dan, I'll just add to that, just to give you a little bit more color on the consumption of price. There is a subset of customers that do take or consume, I should say, based on the number of securities that are priced in the fund holdings that they have. It typically will be custodians and participants such as that. So there -- a lot of them honestly holding most, if not all, of the bond market, if you will. And so as the bond market in size fluctuates and this isn't necessarily related to refinancing which will be sort of canceled and replaced. It's more around new issuance and the growth of the overall bond markets whether it's corporates or munis or structured products as that fluctuates and it tends to be sort of lower single-digit growth over the years, that will help or to some extent hurt the growth in that component of our subscription business. But again, it's a part of the -- it's only a portion of the overall TRD business and the overall data business at the end of the day that, that applies to.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW.\nKyle Voigt: Just wondering if you could comment a bit more on the health of your customers in the Mortgage Tech segment. You mentioned earlier in the call that there were some customers that didn't renew mostly to shuttering or consolidating. But we're really in the beginning phases of what could be a long and challenging volume environment. So I guess the question is, if the current mortgage environment remains extremely challenging over the next year, do you still believe you can grow the recurring revenues year-on-year in that segment and offset client attrition? Or should we expect some slowdown on that part of the business as well?\nBen Jackson: Thanks, Kyle. This is Ben. And we do feel confident in our ability to grow the business over the long-term horizon of that 8% to 10%. And I think this past quarter is a perfect example to point out. You had the market down year-over-year close to 60%. And sequentially, it was down north of 25%. So a very tough environment for clients. And yet, as we approach them about shifting more of their -- the economic model that we have with them more towards subscription, even if it costs us some transaction revenue, they're willing to do that. And that's why we were able to get 2/3 of the customers to renew. And in this environment, low single-digit customers didn't renew. So I think that's a very good sign and a testament to the resiliency of the business but also the mission-critical nature of the technology that we provide. So from that standpoint, I see it all positive. The other thing that if you go back to the slide that Jeff referred to in his comments and you see what's happening with some of the churn and new lenders that are starting up, as some of these personnel are impacted, they're starting up new lending shops. And we're seeing growth in terms of new lenders this year. It's the population from that MERS graph that Jeff showed is higher than it was last year. So that is a testament that there's new startups coming up on the scene. As these folks start up, they want to adopt automation in the most efficient way to set up their businesses and we're well positioned to win that business albeit it's a competitive environment and we compete with others for that. But we have wins in that environment. So we expect some of that churn to continue. But where there's customers that potentially go out of business, there's also startups that happen on the back side of it.\nJeff Sprecher: And this is Jeff. And let me just -- in the past earnings presentations, we've shown you the demographic trends that are going on in the United States. And yes, there are higher interest rates. Yes, there are supply chain issues for homebuilders, uncertainty for homebuilders but there is an unbelievably large demographic of people in this country that are starting new households, having children, getting married, moving on with their lives. And that demographic trend, one way or another, has to be satisfied with a place to live. And so I think what you're really seeing on a macro basis is us building solutions to deal in part with that population.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. And in terms of follow-up, I just wanted to follow up on Dan's prior question just regarding the fixed income ASV growth decelerating to 4% in the quarter versus 5.5% last quarter. I appreciate the additional color on the index business and the headwinds that's facing. But just in terms of quantifying that, was that really the entirety of that kind of deceleration that we saw from 5.5% to 4%? Or were some of the other aspects that you mentioned also playing a role into that when we look sequentially?\nWarren Gardiner: Sure. Kyle, it's Warren. So there are a couple of things there. I mean, certainly, the macro headwinds we talked about on the AUM side and some of the pricing business but also don't forget Euronext is part of that as well. But if you adjust for those, yes, I mean, look, ASP adjusted for those was around 5%. It was closer to 5% for the quarter. So we feel pretty good about that business, given what's going on within fixed income markets at the moment. And again, don't lose -- and Lynn mentioned this but don't lose sight of the overall segment results, where the segment was up 14% year-over-year from a revenue perspective. We're up 12% year-to-date in that business. Operating margins in the quarter or operating income in the quarter, I should say, was up about 30%. And margins grew by 6 points. So overall, we're very happy with the performance of that segment and a lot of the factors that are weighing on what we're seeing on the pricing side, on the index side or what's benefiting for us on the trading side. So those results this year are some of the best we've had ever and so we're pleased with the results of the business overall.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm of UBS.\nAlex Kramm: I want to come back to Richard's question on the energy performance. Ben, in your answer, it almost sounded like you blamed Russia-Ukraine situation almost entirely for what you're seeing, the underperformance there. So that almost sounds a little bit structural. So I just wanted to make sure there are other factors that you could maybe isolate or even point to some green shoots. I don't know. Is it margins having to come down? Is it volatility maybe coming to more normal levels? Or what would you think needs to happen for maybe that business to, in its current form, perform a little bit better unless it really is structural and something has changed? And then quickly, there's more talk of price caps in Europe as well. So just wondering how you view those in terms of impacting your business? Because generally speaking, somebody interfering in market forces is usually not good for volume. So just maybe those two additional areas in energy.\nBen Jackson: Thank you, Alex. Yes, I think what you're seeing -- and I'll give a little more color on some of the things underneath this. But what you're seeing is that a lot of these regimes have not been put in place. So you've got -- and are put -- being put in place, for example, gas oil earlier. It's at the end of this year that those oil deliveries cannot happen. So you have some traders with comp month coming up right now and end of the year that just won't touch those contracts until this gets through. And that's why I also highlighted in the earlier question that we're starting to see open interest build '23 and beyond in the gas oil contract as an example. In natural gas, I think the things that I look at and that are encouraging to me is that when you look at our TTF business and you look at October of last year versus October of the month that just passed, the number of active market participants that we have in TTF is exactly the same. We haven't lost any market participants that are trading TTF. So that, to me, is a sign of longer-term strength in the business as the situation clears. We've also, at the same time, grown our data subscriptions in TTF double digits in that same period of time. So there's more eyeballs and more people paying attention to it. So from a longer-term perspective, we feel good about the positioning of these contracts. As I had mentioned, we're launching new contracts with those new basis gas locations in Italy, Germany and France as well as the Northwest Europe and Southwest Europe LNG contracts. Feedback from traders are all going to price relative to TTF. So we feel good long term about that as well. On price caps that you also mentioned, I mean, look, we understand the severity of the situation in Europe. We are in very active dialogue at the table with government and with regulators and commercial customers to forge a market-based solution to these issues. And we know our role is to create deep liquid futures markets to provide important price signals on supply and demand dynamics as they're changing to make sure that people have the best pricing tools to hedge and manage their risk. Through our discussions and you can also see through media that's happened over the last couple of weeks, there is acknowledgment broadly of the issues with price caps and a general agreement that they don't want to disrupt the price discovery. And a lot of the issues that are being highlighted in these articles and that we've been expressing and commercial market participants have been expressing as well as several governments are that an artificial price limit on the commodity makes it very difficult to accurately hedge commodity price risk. Second would be if you're -- that if you put price caps in these markets, you could end up having the unintended result of taking volume and liquidity from transparent lit markets and moving it to the OTC markets, reversing more than a decade of progress that's been made here. If you create an artificial price in the settlement, in the clearinghouses, it makes it difficult for clearinghouses to manage the accurate risk that we're exposed to if it's dislocated from what the real market price is of that position. And it can create an artificial price that may overencourage consumption which is not what people are looking for right now. And obviously, these markets are global and supplies can go elsewhere. So that's why we're at the table. We're encouraged that recent rhetoric as they understand a lot of those issues and risks. And we're in the middle of putting forth market-based solutions which is why we're proactively launching all these contracts in December and are continuing in the middle of the dialogues to help the situation settle.\nAlex Kramm: I appreciate the incremental color here. Just one quick one for Warren then. It seems like your revenue is benefiting from higher rates directly more. So I was just hoping if you can remind me what the magnitude is, I think, in the OTC and other line on the exchange side. And then on the CDS business, you got net interest income. So maybe some underlying data you can give us in terms of the balances and the rates you're getting, what rates you're mostly sensitive to in Europe and then in the U.S. because, obviously, the rate picture is fairly dynamic these days. So I just wanted to make sure we understand how to model that better.\nWarren Gardiner: Sure. So in terms of OTC and other, about -- if you look at the second quarter, about half of the increase would have been related to member interest. And I'll just say too, within -- not only just the CDS business but also within our clearinghouses, we're not trying to be a bank. The service we're providing is clearing and risk management and that's the value that we're providing to those customers. And so we're actually -- we're trying to lower collateral levels where we can. Ben mentioned pushing people or I should say, leading people towards the benefits of options. We're working on trying to expand the different types of collateral that we accepted such as with some of the emissions allowances. And so we are still -- we are starting to see a little bit of normalization in some of the collateral levels as we sit here in October but it's just difficult to predict where that's going to go. It certainly is a part of -- or a significant part of OTC and other but there are a lot of other elements to that line item as well. So it's been the driver of some of the growth we've seen but it's certainly not the vast majority, if you will, of the total line at the end of the day. And then the same would hold for the CDS business where, certainly, it's helped as we -- as collateral levels have built there. But we're also, as you would imagine, seeing really strong trading volumes across that business -- or clearing volumes across that businesses. As certainly as the headlines around recessions and interest rates continue to build, the demand for credit risk and credit protection is increasing alongside that. So that's been really a bigger driver of things over a longer period of time than anything else. And don't forget, too, that in the third quarter, that's a roll quarter as is the first quarter. So we benefit a little bit from that as well relative to maybe the second and fourth quarter in that business. The other area I would just point out to is if you go below the line, we're actually benefiting a little bit from the cash on hand in our -- the interest that we're earning on the bonds that we have -- or sorry, on the cash we have on hand. So there's a benefit of that from an interest rate perspective as well that's flowing through the income statement, in addition, of course, to the benefit we get on the future side from higher rates within Euribor and some of the U.K. interest rate businesses as well. So there's a number of different things across the platform, of course, as rates are rising that we're benefiting that may be offsetting some of the areas that tend to not do as well during higher rate environments.\nOperator: Due to time constraints, that was our last question today. I'll now hand back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks.\nJeff Sprecher: Well, thank you, Charlie and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I would really like to again thank my colleagues for delivering yet another record quarter and thank our customers for putting your faith in us during these very uncertain times. We appreciate your business. We look forward to updating you all again as we continue to execute on the opportunity set that we were able to talk to you about today. And with that, I hope you have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share increased 4% to $1.31 which is on top of 30% growth in the third quarter of 2021 and marked the best third quarter in our company's history. Third quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.8 billion, up 3% year-over-year. While transaction revenues were flat on a year-over-year basis, our recurring revenues which accounted for over half of our business, increased by 6% with all 3 of our business segments contributing to the strong year-over-year growth. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $727 million and were $16 million below the low end of our guidance. These better-than-expected results were driven by favorable FX trends, continued operating efficiencies and a handful of nonrecurring items within professional services, SG&A and technology. Shifting to the fourth quarter. We now expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $730 million to $740 million, with the increase relative to the third quarter largely reflecting the reversal of onetime items. As you begin to think about 2023 expenses, the midpoint of our current full year guidance or roughly $2.948 billion is a reasonable base to build upon. Despite the dynamic and uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, the diversity and importantly, durability of our business has enabled us to invest through cycles. And while taking the current inflationary backdrop into consideration, we expect to once again invest in our people and the many medium- and long-term growth opportunities that exist across our expanded business. Third quarter adjusted operating income totaled $1.1 billion, up over 6% year-over-year and is on top of 13% pro forma growth in 2021, while adjusted operating margin expanded by nearly 180 basis points to approximately 60%. Through the first 3 quarters of 2022, adjusted free cash flow has totaled over $2.1 billion, up 7% year-over-year. Now, let's move to Slide 5 where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter Exchange net revenues totaled $1 billion, an increase of 8% year-over-year. In addition to higher levels of collateral at our clearinghouses and thus higher member interest revenues, this strong performance was driven by a 54% increase in our interest rate futures, a 23% increase in our equity derivatives and a 13% increase in cash equities and options revenues. Importantly, total open interest which we believe to be the best indicator of longer-term growth, ended October up 11% versus the end of last year, including 7% growth in energy and 18% growth across our financial futures and options complex. Recurring revenues increased by 5% year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong demand for our energy exchange data and a continued benefit from our record 2021 listings performance. While recent market volatility has led to a pause in new Listings business, both the backlog and our conversations with potential partners remains robust. And through the end of October, a record 19 corporations, representing a combined market cap of nearly $40 billion, have chosen to transfer to the NYSE. Turning now to Slide 6. In our Fixed Income and Data Services segment, third quarter revenues totaled a record $534 million, a 14% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 84%, including 122% growth in ICE bonds and 75% growth in our CDS clearing business. Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was driven by market volatility and rising interest rates, customers allocating additional capital to CDS trading and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platforms. Recurring revenues, excluding the Euronext migration, grew by 4% in the quarter driven by demand for additional capacity on the ICE Global Network as well as double-digit growth in both our consolidated feeds business and our derivative analytics. Somewhat offsetting the strength were asset-based revenues in our index business which declined by double digits year-over-year as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets such as equities, munis and corporate bonds and into treasury ETFs. In addition, extended fixed income market volatility is also impacting growth in a portion of our end-of-day fixed income pricing business as reduced new issuance has driven slower growth in the number of outstanding bonds available to be priced. Absent a sharp reversal of these macro trends, we'd expect fourth quarter growth to be similar to our third quarter performance. Shifting to Mortgage Technology on Slide 7. Third quarter revenues totaled $276 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for nearly 60% of segment revenues and totaled a record $163 million in the quarter, increased 14% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% decline in origination volumes. Importantly, data and analytics revenue increased 22% year-over-year with underlying recurring revenue increasing by over 40%. Similar to last quarter, it's worth noting that industry unit origination volumes were similar to those in the first quarter of 2019. However, our third quarter 2022 Mortgage Technology revenues were over $100 million greater, growing at a CAGR of approximately 17% when compared to the pro forma revenues in 1Q '19. This is a clear testament to the continued automation and growth and customer adoption of our solutions across the origination workflow. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8. Year-to-date, we've grown ICE revenue by 6%, adjusted operating income by 10% and our adjusted earnings per share by 9%, representing the best year-to-date performance in our company's history. Despite dramatically different macroeconomic environments, over a 3-year period, you will see a similar story of compounding growth with ICE revenues increasing at a CAGR of 8%, operating income at 11% and EPS of 12%, again, a testament to the resilience and durability of our platform and the all-weather nature of our business model. As we look to the balance of this year -- of the year, we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us and remain focused on creating value for our stockholders. With that, I'll hand it over to Ben. So Ken, we'll go ahead and get you the exact number there but I think it's certainly approaching where it was years and I think the record would have been sort of '08, '09, that kind of a range in terms of the revenues. We certainly made some adjustments to RPCs in that complex, too. And there has been some pressure from FX this year. So I think we're approaching to where it was and we're around this level. But I do think that the world is a lot bigger and different than it was back then. And so I think as you think about the future, there's certainly room in what is effectively -- certainly on the Euribor, so the second largest reserve currency for that complex to grow well into the future regardless of what the prior level would have been. And Dan, I'll just add to that, just to give you a little bit more color on the consumption of price. There is a subset of customers that do take or consume, I should say, based on the number of securities that are priced in the fund holdings that they have. It typically will be custodians and participants such as that. So there -- a lot of them honestly holding most, if not all, of the bond market, if you will. And so as the bond market in size fluctuates and this isn't necessarily related to refinancing which will be sort of canceled and replaced. It's more around new issuance and the growth of the overall bond markets whether it's corporates or munis or structured products as that fluctuates and it tends to be sort of lower single-digit growth over the years, that will help or to some extent hurt the growth in that component of our subscription business. But again, it's a part of the -- it's only a portion of the overall TRD business and the overall data business at the end of the day that, that applies to. Sure. Kyle, it's Warren. So there are a couple of things there. I mean, certainly, the macro headwinds we talked about on the AUM side and some of the pricing business but also don't forget Euronext is part of that as well. But if you adjust for those, yes, I mean, look, ASP adjusted for those was around 5%. It was closer to 5% for the quarter. So we feel pretty good about that business, given what's going on within fixed income markets at the moment. And again, don't lose -- and Lynn mentioned this but don't lose sight of the overall segment results, where the segment was up 14% year-over-year from a revenue perspective. We're up 12% year-to-date in that business. Operating margins in the quarter or operating income in the quarter, I should say, was up about 30%. And margins grew by 6 points. So overall, we're very happy with the performance of that segment and a lot of the factors that are weighing on what we're seeing on the pricing side, on the index side or what's benefiting for us on the trading side. So those results this year are some of the best we've had ever and so we're pleased with the results of the business overall. Sure. So in terms of OTC and other, about -- if you look at the second quarter, about half of the increase would have been related to member interest.

            "name": "Jeff Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Ben. I want to start my prepared remarks by highlighting our vision of how ICE is contributing to both the U.S. home mortgage and U.S. equity markets to bring increased efficiencies to consumers in these 2 asset classes. To take you back, ICE was initially founded to build and operate digital commodity exchanges. Modern digital exchanges provide an essential service, efficiently matching buyers and sellers with operational neutrality. Our modern exchanges are regulated. But more importantly, their growth and efficacy depend on the industry's trust of our neutrality. ICE does not take a position on the price of any commodity or security. We simply provide the software and network that efficiently facilitates a buyer and seller finding one another and allows them to determine their transaction price. Today, millions of traders, investors, brokers and regulators around the world are attached to our exchange networks. And they all benefit from the transparency and standardization that we enable. We followed up our launch into the exchange business by building digital data networks to disperse information separate from our exchanges, networks that thrive on the neutrality and confidentiality of our data management. It is likely obvious to you that our data networks would contain financial information generated by our own exchanges but it may be less obvious that our growth has been accelerated by opening these networks to third parties, including most of our global exchange competitors who also access our customer base. Today, hundreds of third-party exchanges, brokers and market data generators publish their data to users across our networks. Our growth in the U.S. mortgage industry builds on the same management tenets: trust, transparency and neutrality. Our mortgage software and network are open and impartial. ICE has been at the forefront of building a mortgage platform so that industry participants can better communicate with one another, reduce their costs, pass these savings on to consumers in the form of better prices and appropriately implement the government's homeownership policies. And it is in this vein that we have agreed to acquire Black Knight to connect their market participants to ours, open up its platform, reduce cost per mortgage origination, overlay the safety and soundness practices that we've developed for businesses like the systemically important New York Stock Exchange and create new products and services for lenders to increase homeownership, including in underserved communities. As a part of the budget that we previously guided you to, ICE plans a significant financial outlay to open and upgrade the Black Knight technology stack, a commitment that we believe would have been hard for Black Knight's other potential acquirers to make potentially in a contracting mortgage environment. This is the same strategy and commitment that we made when taking over the Mortgage Electronic Registrations System which today has durable and scalable operations and technology built by ICE, systems that are prepared to manage the difficult risk environments in the U.S. housing market. And as shown on Slide 10, these MERS processes can identify and deregister failed lending firms who become zombies to borrowers and regulators. You may have recently heard Sandra Thompson, the Federal Housing Finance Agency's Director, lamenting how stakeholders in the mortgage manufacturing process seemingly lack the will to adopt technology that changes their entrenched methods. This is precisely the challenge that ICE is laser-focused on solving. Gillian Tett pointed out in her book, The Silo Effect, that the U.S. mortgage industry is so siloed that the federal government's past attempts to help troubled homeowners stay in their homes by reducing mortgage payments actually exacerbated the foreclosure problem because lenders lowered monthly payments and servicers mistook this as consumers falling behind and initiated foreclosure proceedings. As Austin Gulsby once said, the silos were so strong, they did the exact opposite of what everyone expected. With the explosive growth of the fintech industry over the last decade, the U.S. has seen a dramatic upsurge in the number of alternative home lenders and mortgage technology providers who, like ICE, are building solutions to benefit lenders and borrowers. Slide 10 also shows the number of new lending firms that just this year have registered to do business with MERS. And surprisingly, the number of lending firms have increased in a year where consumer demand for mortgages has decreased. This increased lender competition presents opportunities for ICE to take costs out of the mortgage manufacturing process so that these lenders can compete more effectively, passing no savings on to borrowers. The high cost of manufacturing and funding a home mortgage that we target are particularly acute for the most marginalized borrowers which further exacerbates the wealth divide in the United States. Our acquisition of Black Knight remains subject to review by the Federal Trade Commission. ICE has provided the FTC with extensive information and certified its completeness. And as is often customary, we agreed to extend the FTC's statutory review period and intend to continue ICE's cooperation with the FTC staff. Our estimate is that the Black Knight merger will close in the first half of next year. While we'll be unable to answer any questions on this call relating to our transaction with Black Knight, please note that our participation in this FTC review, coupled with the comprehensive conversations that we've been having with our customer base, has further convinced us that our merger will afford significant benefits to U.S. homeowners and industry stakeholders. And while on the subject of regulators, I'd like to comment on the recent remarks from the Securities and Exchange Commission focused on the structure of the U.S. equities market. In his June 8 speech, Chair Gensler noted the key elements of the national market system rules haven't been updated since year 2005. And since that time, the U.S. equity markets have become increasingly opaque. Today, most retail order flow is executed through off-exchange bilateral trading relationships with a small number of wholesalers. These wholesalers are able to trade against customers without exposing those orders to competition. In some cases, wholesalers pay retail brokers for the privilege of this first look at their clients' order flow. This practice is known as price improvement and it refers to occasions where trade is made at prices better than the national best bid and offer ticker displayed by the public exchanges, trades that often contain fractions less than 1 whole penny per share. What's often left out of this price improvement narrative, however, is the fact that public exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange under current SEC rules are actually prohibited from displaying orders at price increments less than 1 whole penny. As a result, public investors are, in fact, prevented from narrowing the national best bid and offer ticker to sub-penny price increments. But ask yourself this; is the national best bid and offer ticker really the best market price that we should all be relying upon if investors can routinely buy a share of stock cheaper than what's displayed? We measure the opportunity for investor price improvement savings to the tune of $1.8 billion a year if there were a simple harmonization of the quote and trade increments across the entire market. We hope that this opportunity will be considered by the SEC. ICE has been consistent in its strategy of promoting standardization, fair, transparent markets and networks using state-of-the-art technology. We embrace opportunities to transform businesses to create efficiencies and lower customer costs, not only in home mortgage but even in a 230-year-old business like the New York Stock Exchange. I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 11. The third quarter of this year has been marked by rising inflation, fluctuating interest rates and central bank activity, concerns over energy and food security and global political uncertainty. And I can't think of any firm that has been better positioned to help manage these risks than ICE. Our customers rely on our data, technology and liquid markets to navigate through this environment. In the third quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share. These record-setting third quarter results against our extraordinary third quarter results of last year reflect the all-weather nature of our business model. We have intentionally positioned the company to provide customer solutions in numerous geographies and economic conditions to facilitate all-weather results. I'd like to end by thanking our customers for their continued business and their trust. And I want to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to this record third quarter following up on our unsurpassed first half results. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Charlie. And we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time. And this is Jeff. And let me just -- in the past earnings presentations, we've shown you the demographic trends that are going on in the United States. And yes, there are higher interest rates. Yes, there are supply chain issues for homebuilders, uncertainty for homebuilders but there is an unbelievably large demographic of people in this country that are starting new households, having children, getting married, moving on with their lives. And that demographic trend, one way or another, has to be satisfied with a place to live. And so I think what you're really seeing on a macro basis is us building solutions to deal in part with that population. Well, thank you, Charlie and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. I would really like to again thank my colleagues for delivering yet another record quarter and thank our customers for putting your faith in us during these very uncertain times. We appreciate your business. We look forward to updating you all again as we continue to execute on the opportunity set that we were able to talk to you about today. And with that, I hope you have a good day."

            "content": "Dan, this is Lynn Martin. Thanks so much for the question. And absolutely, volatility has been a tailwind for the execution side of the business with record levels of CDS clearing so far in 2022. But what we're really -- we continue to be really excited about is the pickup of activity in our ICE bond platform where as a result of the continued Fed rate hikes, you've seen tremendous volatility in fixed income markets globally. And ICE bond is a beneficiary of some of that volatilities, particularly in our treasury, our muni, our corporate bond, our CD business where you've seen record levels of activity and volatility. In fact, activity measured on a volume perspective is almost 200% up in Q3 versus last Q3. A very important factor, though, is how we broaden out the participation in those platforms, particularly focused on institutional customers. And in Q3 alone, in our muni markets, you saw the levels of institutional participation grow by 192%. So that just continues on a trend that we've seen as a result of thinking about particularly the muni markets as an ecosystem and driving additional institutional participation across our platform. So Dan, this is Lynn again. I think I'll start off and then turn it over to Warren. Thanks for the follow-up question because I think what you're pointing to really illustrates how we build businesses to be all-weather businesses. We talked about the volatility in the markets being a significant tailwind for our execution side of the business but it's been a bit of a headwind for our fixed income data and analytics line, whereas Warren said in his prepared remarks, if you think about our index business, we've seen assets flow out of our higher capture indices, specifically equities, corporate bonds and munis. And assets flow into indices where we have a lower capture rate, specifically our treasury indices. In fact, if you look at the AUM benchmarked against our indices, it's actually at an all-time high. But the mix has significantly changed which impacts the revenue. And as Warren said, another headwind we're seeing that's affecting the fixed income data and analytics line is the new bond issuance which looked in fixed income this year. So that has impacted the growth rate of our legacy PRD business which has continued to grow albeit at a much slower rate. That said, volatility, again, has been a tailwind for the other part of our data services, particularly our other data services line where you see various factors increasing to what we believe is outsized growth in that line, including 22% increase in demand for capacity in our ICE Global Network as volatility continues to require customers to have reliable, resilient connectivity and higher bandwidth connectivity, double-digit growth in our consolidated feeds business, double-digit growth in our data analytics business which provides transparency to opaque asset classes and outsized growth in our desktop platform, specifically our chat platforms as ways that customers interact with our market continue to modernize."

            "name": "Ben Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. In our financial markets, rising inflation and central bank activity across Europe and the U.K. continued to drive increased hedging activity with interest rate average daily volumes increasing 40% year-over-year in the third quarter, including record Euribor futures. In our equity derivatives complex, ADV in our MSCI complex was up 17% in the third quarter as volatility levels continue to be elevated versus the prior year. In our energy markets, the third quarter was marked with the confluence of macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties that, when combined with high price volatility, made for a difficult trading environment. Despite these uncertain conditions, we have seen strength in areas like our options markets, our North American gas business and our North American environmental complex. Options contracts are a valuable tool in highly uncertain market conditions due to the ability to manage geopolitical tail risk and the lower associated capital requirements as we've seen historically. With open interest up 29% versus the end of last year, we are pleased that our customers continue to turn to our deep liquid options markets to manage their risk. The evolving energy supply chain in Europe is increasing the demand for global liquefied natural gas sourced from the United States, driving price volatility in our North American gas markets. Our commercial customers continue to rely on our markets to manage their risk, contributing to a 23% volume growth in our North American gas business year-to-date and an all-time record in North American gas open interest as we have gained 500 basis points of market share over the past year versus our peers. Finally, although our European carbon markets are seeing headwinds due to the aforementioned factors, we continue to see growth in active participants in this market with participation up 7% year-over-year. At the same time, the secular trend towards cleaner energy is also driving growth in our North American environmental markets with volumes up 6% year-over-year in the third quarter. And because we offer the broadest suite of environmental products across the carbon cycle, we remain excited about our position to serve customers as they navigate the journey to cleaner energy and as the demand for transparent pricing in carbon grows. Importantly, as we look out over the longer term, we believe that the 3 secular drivers across our energy markets remain intact: First, increasing energy demand; second, an evolving energy supply chain; and third, the clean energy transition. And because we operate deep liquid markets across the globe with benchmarks in emerging markets across every source of energy, we feel very well positioned to benefit from these factors. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business; we delivered record revenues which grew 14% year-over-year. Our comprehensive fixed income and data platform continues to deliver compounding revenue growth underpinned by both our recurring and transaction revenues, a testament to the strategic diversification of our business model and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments. Turning now to our Mortgage business. In the third quarter, our Mortgage business once again outperformed the broader industry driven by strong recurring revenues. The strength and resiliency that we've seen in recurring revenues has been driven by our new customers continuing to adopt our digital solutions, increased demand for our data and analytics tools and continued strong retention. Our customers remain focused on automation and efficiencies. This focus has led to increased interest in our data and analytics products, contributing to a 22% growth year-to-date in our data and analytics business. Through our AIQ solution and analyzer tools, customers can save thousands of dollars per loan by leveraging our artificial intelligence and machine learning tools to drive automation in the loan manufacturing process. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to leverage our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Sure. Rich, it's Ben. So as you can appreciate, our whole hypothesis on this deal and what we've been doing in the mortgage space is all directed towards a long-term view of taking one of the most analog asset classes that there are and turning it digital. And that's what we believe over the long term, it will enable us to achieve that 8% to 10% growth. And the contributors underneath that are really -- we're very focused on product innovation and in particular, helping our lender customers, lower cost become more efficient. And as we do that, we're hoping that the savings that those lenders achieve are then brought down to their clients, the end consumer and will translate into better selection. It will help to lower cost for the end consumer. It will help enable them to get the best products at the most efficient prices to meet their needs and achieve the dream of homeownership. So that's from a long-term perspective what our focus has been and where we're making our investments. Overall, what's driving our ability to beat is the intentional shift towards subscription revenue. So if you look across each of the segments that we have, we're pushing very hard to move more and more of the revenue in each of those reporting segments more towards subscription when we can. And one of the things I'll highlight in terms of success this last quarter, even with all the headwinds that the industry has had, 2/3 of the customers that renewed in the third quarter renewed at higher subscription base levels by the end of that quarter than they were at, at the beginning of the quarter. The other thing I'd say is that it is -- it has been a difficult environment. It has been a difficult environment. And despite that, we only saw a single -- small single-digit percentage of our clients not renew and most of that's due to M&A industry consolidation and closing up shop. But one of the things we've seen as a positive for us with some of the backdrop of this industry consolidation as some of these companies and their employees have been downsized, some of these impacted personnel have used it as an opportunity to become an entrepreneur and start a new lending shop. And those are opportunities that we compete for and we've won some of that business on Encompass this past quarter. So we've seen sales success in origination on Encompass, both in the smaller start-up companies, the mid-market as well as banks. So that said, a lot of what's going on in our origination process, our origination line item and reporting line item as well as the fact as we've moved more and more of that revenue to our subscription and we have very low attrition. In the data and analytics area, what's really fueling our ability to beat there is the same. So data and analytics does have historically a transaction element to it. We have been moving this line item very similar to our origination line item more and more towards subscription as clients renew. And as we sign new clients, make sure that we're tilting those deals much more towards subscription revenue. And the big piece of products that we have in that area is a product called AIQ. That's the product that's automating a lot of the underwriting processes and that's a big area of where today, we're generating around $1,400 of savings in originating a loan. A lot of it is anchored in this area of automating the underwriting process for our customers. I mentioned that in the second quarter, we signed JPMorgan Chase that's going through an implementation on this. And this quarter, we had several wins across different segments that we sell to from banks, nonbanks and credit unions. And we had a significant win with loanDepot this past quarter which they, like many lenders, are trying to get the efficiencies that we -- that our platform will provide to them. So that's a little bit of a flavor in some of the segments of what we see under the covers. Sure. Sure, Rich. It's Ben again. And you alluded to it in the way that you asked the question around the way that we manage this business is from looking at the overall portfolio and we have a wide lens on this. And we pride ourselves in having the deepest and most liquid futures markets to enable our customers to manage risk across the energy spectrum, also in the global rates environment. We manage our business as an overall portfolio and that's the nature of that all-weather aspect of our stock. In energy specifically which is where you were going, we manage even the energy segment as a portfolio. And we're proud to say that despite all these headwinds, our energy business itself, open interest is up when you look across the entire business, is up 6% since the end of last year. And this is in the backdrop of a confluence of all kinds of issues that the world is dealing with right now. You have this unfortunate war. You have on-and-off lockdowns in China. You have a push to move towards cleaner energy sources. You have underinvestment in energy infrastructure. You have major releases from the strategic petroleum reserve, all rearing their head at the same time. And we're proud that now more than ever, our clients are coming to us to manage their risk. And I'll touch on a couple of areas within energy. And you asked specifically about gas oil, so I'll touch on that as well. So broadly speaking, we positioned our business to help clients manage their transition towards a cleaner energy environment. That's why we have the most deep liquid markets around the globe in oil, natural gas, power, LNG and environmentals. In oil, we have seen some headwinds. You focused on gas oil and you're spot on. And gas oil has had some headwinds. Most of this is associated to the market needing clarity around how Russian oil deliveries into the contract would be handled because, historically, Russian oil did go into that contract. We work with governments and customers to come up with a market-based solution to this and also landed on a sanctions regime that we align to that at the end of this year, Russian oil can no longer be delivered into that contract. Once we did that and provided clarity to the market for that, we have started to see open interest rebuild in that contract in calendar year '23 and beyond. So that's a positive. It's going to take some time for that to play out but we're seeing that on the horizon. We believe that, that's going to turn the corner. Within oil itself, expanding further across what's going on in the portfolio, we've had some very positive developments. So our options contracts have done very, very well. Brent alone has seen options volume up 14% year-over-year. And part of the reason for that is that options contracts enable a trader to hedge a whole range of outcome. It enables them an efficient way to manage geopolitical risks. And there's also a little bit of a lower-margin requirement associated with these because if you're buying an option, your risk on that option is limited to the premium that you pay. So all of that's incorporated into the margin models. So we've seen a lot of success in our options markets. And we have new innovations; we continue to build our Murban contract that we launched. And we're continuing to hit records consistently with our Midland WTI Gulf Coast contract that we launched earlier this year. So we're having some good success and continue to build on that. The other area I'd touch on quickly would be natural gas. So our natural gas business, you have to again expand the lens and look at it from a global perspective. I mentioned U.S. gas is at a record and up 23% in volume. And globally, our natural gas business is up 16% and 6% in OI. And some of the inputs to that is our TTF business has seen some headwinds because Russia has historically supplied 40% of the gas to Continental Europe and the supply has effectively been cut off. But what's filling the void? U.S. LNG is filling that void for Europe. And that's fueling strength in our North American gas complex as commercial customers are trading our Henry and our basis markets significantly. And also a lot of those LNG cargoes that are going to Europe are hedged by our TTF contract, our Henry Hub contract, basis markets as well as our LNG markets. And the last thing I'd say on the gas markets is that we're innovating and working on market-based solutions with Europe as we understand the situation there. And we're -- we announced just recently, we're going to be launching some new contracts, new basis contracts in Italy, France and Germany in gas to trade alongside our existing Continental gas business and then in Northwest Europe and Southwest Europe LNG contracts that will trade alongside our JKM contract. And it's important that the feedback we're getting from our clients is that all of these contracts are likely to trade basis and relative to our TTF deep liquid price benchmark. Ken, it's Ben. I'll start here. The -- so when you look across our rates business, the way we look at it and we manage it, we manage it as a portfolio. We look at, in particular, the largest parts of our rate franchise are with our SONIA Gilts business as well as Euribor. And underneath the covers, when you look at what's been going on geopolitically and the overall environment, Continental Europe has actually done a pretty good job of signaling how they're going to handle this rates environment. And the market has responded very well to that. And that's what's led to just a very, very solid year in terms of Euribor volumes as well as open interest as that is up over 60% on a year-over-year basis. So that part of the business has done extraordinarily well. If you look at the U.K. specifically and Gilt and SONIA, there's 2 dynamics going on there. With SONIA specifically when you're comparing our performance with last year, you have to remember that last year, we had both short sterling and SONIA trading side by side. And this year -- and then those converged in December of last year. So this year, you have SONIA only. So there's a bit of an off comparison there as there was a significant amount of arbitrating going on between SONIA and short sterling as that converge into what's taking place. And now you have SONIA as a stand-alone. In the U.K., though, specifically, obviously, there's been political uncertainty there. You've had the change of Prime Ministers. You've got uncertain rate hike expectations. You had the mini budget that shocked a lot of people. You had a potential currency crisis all hitting at the same time. And that definitely weighed a little bit on SONIA and Gilt but we're already seeing signs that the market is stabilizing as the environment has stabilized there. So we feel very good about that overall rates portfolio that we have. It's definitely an area we're continuing to invest. We have our own SOFR contract that we've launched as well. And it's an area that we're going to continue to invest and we see opportunity. Thanks, Kyle. This is Ben. And we do feel confident in our ability to grow the business over the long-term horizon of that 8% to 10%. And I think this past quarter is a perfect example to point out. You had the market down year-over-year close to 60%. And sequentially, it was down north of 25%. So a very tough environment for clients. And yet, as we approach them about shifting more of their -- the economic model that we have with them more towards subscription, even if it costs us some transaction revenue, they're willing to do that. And that's why we were able to get 2/3 of the customers to renew. And in this environment, low single-digit customers didn't renew. So I think that's a very good sign and a testament to the resiliency of the business but also the mission-critical nature of the technology that we provide. So from that standpoint, I see it all positive. The other thing that if you go back to the slide that Jeff referred to in his comments and you see what's happening with some of the churn and new lenders that are starting up, as some of these personnel are impacted, they're starting up new lending shops. And we're seeing growth in terms of new lenders this year. It's the population from that MERS graph that Jeff showed is higher than it was last year. So that is a testament that there's new startups coming up on the scene. As these folks start up, they want to adopt automation in the most efficient way to set up their businesses and we're well positioned to win that business albeit it's a competitive environment and we compete with others for that. But we have wins in that environment. So we expect some of that churn to continue. But where there's customers that potentially go out of business, there's also startups that happen on the back side of it. Thank you, Alex. Yes, I think what you're seeing -- and I'll give a little more color on some of the things underneath this. But what you're seeing is that a lot of these regimes have not been put in place. So you've got -- and are put -- being put in place, for example, gas oil earlier. It's at the end of this year that those oil deliveries cannot happen. So you have some traders with comp month coming up right now and end of the year that just won't touch those contracts until this gets through. And that's why I also highlighted in the earlier question that we're starting to see open interest build '23 and beyond in the gas oil contract as an example. In natural gas, I think the things that I look at and that are encouraging to me is that when you look at our TTF business and you look at October of last year versus October of the month that just passed, the number of active market participants that we have in TTF is exactly the same. We haven't lost any market participants that are trading TTF. So that, to me, is a sign of longer-term strength in the business as the situation clears. We've also, at the same time, grown our data subscriptions in TTF double digits in that same period of time. So there's more eyeballs and more people paying attention to it. So from a longer-term perspective, we feel good about the positioning of these contracts. As I had mentioned, we're launching new contracts with those new basis gas locations in Italy, Germany and France as well as the Northwest Europe and Southwest Europe LNG contracts. Feedback from traders are all going to price relative to TTF. So we feel good long term about that as well. On price caps that you also mentioned, I mean, look, we understand the severity of the situation in Europe. We are in very active dialogue at the table with government and with regulators and commercial customers to forge a market-based solution to these issues. And we know our role is to create deep liquid futures markets to provide important price signals on supply and demand dynamics as they're changing to make sure that people have the best pricing tools to hedge and manage their risk. Through our discussions and you can also see through media that's happened over the last couple of weeks, there is acknowledgment broadly of the issues with price caps and a general agreement that they don't want to disrupt the price discovery. And a lot of the issues that are being highlighted in these articles and that we've been expressing and commercial market participants have been expressing as well as several governments are that an artificial price limit on the commodity makes it very difficult to accurately hedge commodity price risk. Second would be if you're -- that if you put price caps in these markets, you could end up having the unintended result of taking volume and liquidity from transparent lit markets and moving it to the OTC markets, reversing more than a decade of progress that's been made here. If you create an artificial price in the settlement, in the clearinghouses, it makes it difficult for clearinghouses to manage the accurate risk that we're exposed to if it's dislocated from what the real market price is of that position. And it can create an artificial price that may overencourage consumption which is not what people are looking for right now. And obviously, these markets are global and supplies can go elsewhere. So that's why we're at the table. We're encouraged that recent rhetoric as they understand a lot of those issues and risks. And we're in the middle of putting forth market-based solutions which is why we're proactively launching all these contracts in December and are continuing in the middle of the dialogues to help the situation settle."

I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll now turn the call over to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks MC. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide four with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.32. The 14% increase year-over-year, marking the best second quarter in our company's history, and is on top of 12% growth in the second quarter of 2021. Net revenues totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of 8% versus last year, driven by a balanced contribution from both our diversified transaction revenues and our recurring revenues, which account for over half of our business and increased by 8% versus last year. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million and were at the low end of our guidance range versus the midpoint of our guide, second quarter expenses benefited from favorable FX, various expense efficiencies and lower variable costs, particularly customer acquisition costs and our listings business. Moving to the full year, we're lowering our expense guidance to a range of $2.97 billion to $2.99 billion midpoint to midpoint this represents a reduction of $35 million versus our prior guidance and similar to our second quarter results is driven by expense efficiencies, lower variable costs and favorable FX. Second quarter adjusted operating income increased by 14% to $1.1 billion their adjusted operating margin expanding to 59%. Moving to the balance sheet, shortly after we reported our first quarter results in May, we took the opportunity to raise $8 billion in new SR notes. We used 3 billion of these proceeds to refinance our 2022 and 2023 maturities and along with the proceeds from our sale of Euroclear reduced our commercial paper balances to zero with no maturities until the middle of 2025, we enter the second half of the balance sheet that is well positioned and it's an exceptionally volatile interest rate environment. The remaining $5 billion of proceeds raised in May, is earmarked to fund a portion of our announced acquisition of Black Knight based on a favorable rates that we've secured on these long-term notes, and the current forward rate expectations for both our commercial paper and term loan, we anticipate we will be well within our targeted 4% to 4.5% cost of debt financing for the transaction. It is also worth noting that alongside the financing in May, we maintained our A minus and A3 pre-acquisition ratings from both S&P and Moody's. Now let's move to Slide five, to provide an overview of the performance of our exchange segment. Second quarter exchange net revenues totaling $1 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, this strong performance was driven by an 80% increase in our interest rate futures, and that's 36% increase in our equity derivatives revenues. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, and in July up 11% versus the end of last year, including 6% growth in energy and 21% growth across our financial futures and options complex. Second quarter cash equities and equity options revenue increased by 17% year-over-year, and in July, we successfully migrated the NYCE Arca Options platform to our new pillar technology, while continuing to seamlessly process record message volume, a testament to our team's hard work and our broader technology expertise. Exchange recurring revenues increased by 7% year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong demand in our energy exchange data continued benefit from our record 2021 listings performance and a one-time accrual in our listings business that we do not expect will reoccur in the second half. Turning now to Slide six. In our fixed income and data services segment, second quarter revenue totaled a record $512 million a 13% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 78%, including 85% growth in ICE bonds, and 76% growth in our CDS clearing business. This strong growth was driven in part by customers re-engaging and allocating more capital to CDS trading, as well as our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity through our bond platforms, where we're seeing market share gains and our municipal bond business. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for over 80% of segment revenues grew 5% in the quarter and was once again driven by strength in our consolidated fees business as well as continued growth in the ICE global network. Looking to the second half, we expect year-over-year growth in our recurring revenues to continue supported by an ASD that interest in the third quarter up over 5% year-over-year. And in that second half as reported recurring revenues, we flat to slightly up versus our first half results driven by your Euronext data center migration which was included in our original guidance and $10 million of additional FX headwinds. Shifting to mortgage technology on Slide seven. Second quarter revenues totaled $297 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for over half of the segment revenues and totaled $160 million in the quarter increased 18% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a 40% decline in origination volumes. While the current macroeconomic backdrop is challenging for a number of our customers is also presented an opportunity to have more constructive conversations around efficiency and automation across the mortgage origination workflow. It's worth noting that second quarter unit origination volumes were similar to those in the second quarter of 2019. However, second quarter 2022 revenues in our mortgage technology business were over $100 million greater or up almost 60% when compared to pro forma revenues in 2Q \u00e2\u0080\u009819. This is a clear testament to the continued automation and growth and customer adoption of our solutions across the origination workflow. I'll conclude on Slide eight. To the first half of the year, we've grown total ICE revenue by 7% adjusted operating income by 11%, including 200 basis points of margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share by 12%, representing the best first half in our history. In addition, we've positioned our balance sheet for the acquisition of Black Knight while also growing our dividend and continuing to invest in future growth. As we look to the balance of the year, we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us, and we remain focused on creating value for our stockholders. With that, I'll hand it over to Ben.\nBen Jackson: Thank you, Warren. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide nine. Rising inflation has created an interest rate environment, many of our customers have not navigated in over a decade. Meanwhile, the continued war in Ukraine has triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain, creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants. Importantly, we remain focused on connecting customers to our leading technology, mission critical data, and transparent and accessible markets to navigate these uncertain conditions. In our interest rate markets, we've seen record year-to-date volumes in our your  contract as customers increasingly seek to manage risks associated with rising rates and central bank activity across Europe and the U.K. This heightened risk has also contributed to strength in our equity derivatives complex, driving an 18% increase in volumes year-to-date. Across our global energy markets, customers are navigating supply uncertainty alongside longer term Clean Energy Transition priorities. This will continue to introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which should drive greater demand for risk management. And it is our diverse global energy markets that provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools customers need to navigate both the near-term and long-term complexities. Globalization of gas and the clean energy transition are trends that have contributed to the 43% average annual volume growth in our TTF gas business over the past five years, driving TTF to emerge as a global gas benchmark. Through the first half of this year, as a result of the Russia Ukraine conflict, global gas markets have tightened significantly, increasing the demand for global liquefied natural gas in an uncertain geopolitical environment. This volatility and uncertainty has driven our global gas volumes increased 31% year-to-date, including 49% growth in our North American gas business in the second quarter. Commercial customers continue to rely on our markets to manage their risk, as evidenced by the record share in open interest we've achieved in our Henry Hub contract, surpassing 50% for the first time ever. Because we operate a global gas market with benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia, we are well positioned to benefit from both the near- term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets. Despite these global energy concerns, governments, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. As such, valuing externalities such as placing a price on pollution, carbon free electricity, and carbon sequestration and storage will continue to increase in importance. ICE has one of the largest networks of environmental products to value such externalities across the carbon cycle, including renewable fuel contracts, carbon allowances, nature-based solutions, and renewable energy certificates. The breadth of our complex, coupled with the growing importance of carbon price transparency, has contributed to the 19% average annual volume growth in our environmental complex over the past five years. As the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmental alongside our gas and oil complexes will provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to manage these evolving risks. Turning now to our mortgage business. I first want to touch on our pending acquisition of Black Knight as announced on May 4 of this year. As we said, when we made our announcement back then we continued to believe the transaction will close during the first half of 2023. Since the announcement, and in accordance with our initial expected timeline, we have submitted the necessary regulatory filings. We are working with the FTC as they perform their thoughtful and comprehensive reviews of the proposed transaction. Out of respect for the FTC is important work on this matter as we work with them toward regulatory approval, we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly, we remain very excited about the efficiencies that combined entities will bring to the end consumer and other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem. As interest rates rise, and mortgage origination volumes soften from recent record levels, our customers continue to turn to our mission critical technology to operate more efficiently. In the second quarter, we once again grew recurring revenues and outperformed the broader industry. Our focus during these evolving market conditions is first and foremost, our customer. Customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation and we continued to work with our customers to find the most efficient ways they can benefit from the breadth of offerings across our network. For example, we recently made the decision to offer interested customers our base eCO solution included in an Encompass subscription, making it easier and cheaper for customers to adopt and benefit from the efficiencies from an electronic closing. To focus on efficiencies has also led to increased interest in our data and analytics products, leveraging machine learning technology, our analytics platform automates the steps in the loan manufacturing process, and can save lenders 1000s of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. Year-to-date, our data analytics business, which is made up largely of recurring revenues, has grown 21% year-over-year, we continue to see increased adoption of our analytics and new customers coming onto the platform, with a host of new clients added this year alone represented the likes of Chase, a number of leading independent mortgage bankers, and a top three home builder. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders, and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening across the mortgage industry. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. The first half of the year has been marked by rising inflation, rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers are navigating evolving risks and continued to rely on our data, technology and liquid markets to manage these risks. In the second quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income, and grew adjusted earnings per share these record setting second quarter results reflect the strength of our network and the all weather nature of our business model. Our strategy has always been to find unique and novel ways to apply data and technology to bring efficiencies and transparency to markets whether it was moving energy trading to the screen, clearing OTC swaps, modernizing the technology powering the U.S. equity markets, or building datasets for the opaque fixed income markets. As we've grown and diversified, we've broadened our opportunity set and our expertise has grown, providing new markets to grow into, and importantly, new ways to provide innovative solutions to customers. We've leveraged our leading pricing and reference data to build new tools for the front office. We've married our fixed income data to newly expanded climate capabilities. And more recently, we've combined our expertise in futures contract construction, with our index capabilities, and with our unique mortgage data to launch both the ICE mortgage rate lock index and its associated futures contract. These are just a few examples of the innovation that we can deliver with our expanded technology, datasets and expertise. Our evolution has been intentional, diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues with the goal of building a business that today generates compounding earnings growth. It's how we've grown our adjusted earnings per share for the past 15 years in every year that we've been a public company. The net result of our compounding earnings growth is the compounding growth in our dividend, which we've grown double digits each year on average since we initiated it in 2013 and which we also grew 15% in this quarter. Looking now to the second half of the year and beyond, we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us. And we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers while driving compounding growth for our stockholders. I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business and their trust and I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our record second quarter, following on the heels of our best first quarter, making this an unsurpassed first half result for our company. With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator Victoria, and will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now start our Q&A session. . And our first question comes from Rich Repetto at Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRich Repetto: Good morning, Jeff and Ben and Warren. It's unfortunate, we can't get any comments on the Black Knight acquisition, because that's certainly on everybody's mind. But anyway, I'll ask about fixed income. Ben, you saw probably a nice uptick in fixed income execution, I think it's up 85% up 10 million, just quarter-over-quarter. And I would suspect that's just the retail, your retail complex   picking up? And then one other question related to fixed income, the recurring revenues went down quarter-to-quarter just by a million, I suspect that's currency, but just wanted to get some clarification there as well.\nJeff Sprecher: Hi, Rich. I'm going to hand it over to Lynn to go through this.\nLynn Martin: Hi, Rich. Thanks for the question. You're right that we saw strong growth in our fixed income trading business this quarter. And as mentioned in our prepared remarks that was driven off of strengthened our muni trading business. And while volatility and the return of retail has certainly been a contributor, we're seeing our institutional efforts pay off. As you are aware over the last two years, we really focused on leveraging our market leading assets in the muni ecosystem, including our data assets and our index business, which now serves as the benchmark for more than 60% of the AUM in this area to build out the infrastructure to connect the institutional market to our muni execution platforms. And in this quarter alone, we're seeing the benefits of that work manifest itself. And that institutional share within our muni execution platforms has doubled since 2020, enabling us to take share in the broader muni market. And finally, it's worth noting that our institutional business in munis has grown 250%, year-over-year, a further sign that we're gaining share in this asset class.\nWarren Gardiner: And then, Rich, its Warren on your question on the recurring revenues. You're right. That's FX, largely FX, there's also a little bit of AUM related revenue in our ETF business. So as we saw during the quarter people shifting into treasuries and out of equities, and some of the credit focused ETFs. There's lower economics on those treasury ETFs that we bent that track our benchmarks and so that was a little bit of a mix shift impact for us as well within the AUM portion of the index. The rest of the index business did really well during the quarter up double digits. Again, some of the subscription revenue, pure subscription revenue, if you will, in there. So really just kind of the macro dynamics taking hold there that why you saw that slight sequential decline.\nRich Repetto: Got it. Thanks for the update.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm at UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning. Lots of info you gave already on the mortgage side. But we'd like to dig a little bit deeper in particular on the recurring side. So few questions here. One I don't know if you gave an update to the recurring revenue guide for that segment that would be interested if that's still unchanged, but then more importantly, I think you mentioned that even like some of the challenges in the end markets you are seeing some bankruptcies, et cetera. So maybe you could give us an update what you're seeing in terms of customer losses, and maybe remind us how the revenue model is if there's any receipts, et cetera. And then, sorry, lastly, maybe give us a little bit of the algorithm of growth that you've seen so far in the recurring revenues year-to-date between customer losses, but then also some of the upsells that you guys were talking about earlier. And then, also this continued shift to moving the contract terms to more recurring, so I know that's a mouthful, but hopefully I get out of it.\nBen Jackson: Yes, that's a lot Alex. This is Ben. I'll start and Warren will also I'm sure add in here. So in terms of, I'll start with this, just the overall challenges in the environment. If you take a step back, and you look at what we're building, we're building a business here that in mortgage whether a number of different market environments with an eye towards an 8% to 10% growth over the long-haul. And why are we confident in our ability to do that is the reasons are one we have absolutely mission critical software for these clients that we're providing. We have long-term contracts with our clients, four to five years of the high amount of retention in them. And we are heavily focused, as you've seen in our results, on shifting the revenue to more and more towards recurring. And we did it again this quarter, on the backdrop of 40% down market in terms of volumes, with 18% year-over-year recurring revenue growth in the business. The other Proofpoint, you've seen in terms of being able to weather various market environments is our data analytics line item. With that being up 36% last quarter alone. And one of the key inputs and drivers to that is our AIQ and analyzer solutions, we're seeing tremendous uptake in that we're seeing clients now more than ever just looking to adopt automation to automate as much of the workflow as possible to lower their costs. And the other proof point I put out, there was a comment Warren made in his prepared remarks, in that if you look at Q2 of 2019, very similar volume environment to what we saw in this past quarter, we generated more than $100 million of revenue on a pro forma basis. And that's, what enables us to do as we do time studies, with our clients, and clients that adopt our full automation suite, we see are saving anywhere from 570 to $1,400 per loan that they're manufacturing when they adopt our solutions. So our ability to capture some benefit from that from the efficiencies that we're providing to the industry has been tremendous. In terms of the algorithm of growth, on recurring revenue, it's really -- it's a mix that we've described before, it's a mix of, there is some pricing in there, there is sales to new clients. So I mentioned, we had a good start of the year for sales on Encompass. We've had a good sales for the year on our AIQ business. And then also the other input is that shift as customers are renewing that shift of -- even if we have to forego some transaction revenue of moving more to subscription, we're continuing to do that, and have a lot of success. And we're still early days, we're really in the first year of a codified program to do that. And with contracts with clients going four to five years in the future we have a long runway to go.\nWarren Gardiner: Alex, this is Warren, you asked about the guidance. So yes, you're correct. There's no change to the guidance that we gave to start the year. We did assume, as we said back then that there will be some headwinds from people potentially going out of business or maybe not as many new market participants, I'll say I'm highly confident that to the extent that starts to play out, that's going to be a cyclical trend, not a secular one, because I think if you think about the process for and this is reiterating what Ben just said, we think about the rest of getting a mortgage, it continues to be very costly for the consumer, it's very inefficient. And we have the tools that are -- building the tools that are really solving those problems. And so I know that probably doesn't help, solve for 2022, EPS or 2023 EPS, but it should really factor into kind of the multiple people are thinking about when you're valuing the overall enterprise at the end of the day.\nAlex Kramm: So you haven't seen a lot of impact from cancellations at this point, just to clarify.\nBen Jackson: Hey, Alex. It's Ben again. So we have seen a small, small number of lenders that have had some challenges and potentially go out of business, but it's a very small number that we've seen so far.\nAlex Kramm: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: Perfect. Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt at KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. So last quarter, you spoke about energy traders moving away from using futures and towards options at least for oil specifically, just given the decline in oil futures open interest throughout 2Q it seemed like that trend may have continued. Just wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing from commodity trading firms right now trying to manage risk in an extremely volatile environment. Because I guess given the volatility, we've seen the market, it's a bit surprising to see energy volumes only up 3% in the second quarter and now seemingly kind of trending lower year-on-year into the third quarter. Thank you.\nBen Jackson: Hey, Kyle, it's Ben. So you have a -- we have a confluence of issues that are going on around the world that are really unprecedented. And against that backdrop, we're pleased that our overall, our overall futures business is up for year-over-year in terms of open interest and since the end of the year, and our energy businesses up in open interest since the end of the year, given all of these events. And what are we looking at, we're looking at an inflationary environment, we're looking at a recession, you've got in particular in Europe, governments in Europe, have to figure out the balance between sanctions against Russia, the impact of those sanctions against their civilians, in terms of near-term price impact on energy, and move towards cleaner energy. So you've got this pothole mix and then you also have in China continued COVID lockdowns that are happening, and obviously geopolitical tensions happening with China. So given all those issues, we believe that our marketplace has been set up as best as can be in the in the world to help clients navigate through all of these events, and they're utilizing us to do that. And I'll give a few examples. So first, we have one of the most deep and liquid markets across that energy spectrum. So think of oil, gas, LNG, power and environmentals. So as clients are looking to move and switch between fuels, looking towards, moving towards a cleaner environment, we are the exchange and clearing businesses that they're going to do that. Second, in managing global supply shocks, you have deep -- we have deep liquid global markets in each of those respective asset classes that I mentioned with oil, gas, LNG, power, and environmentals and enable customers because we have all these deep liquid points at the points of production and consumption, as clients need to hedge their risks using different risk management tools. We're very well positioned to do that. And a perfect example is right now with Russia, stifling gas supplies going into Europe, we are seeing U.S. step in and U.S. providing natural gas via LNG cargos going into Northern Europe. And given that we are the home to the vast majority of commercial traders, that trade our U.S. gas products, both Henry Hub and our bases markets, we're seeing clients use that to hedge those cargos. And it's one of the inputs that's led to what I mentioned in my prepared remarks of the record we've seen in market share from a Henry Hub perspective, as well as a North American gas and at a highest well in the global gas complex. The third thing I'd point out is that we're engaged as much as ever with clients and governments around the world around the sanctions and as they're taking shape. And there's no question it had some impact, as there was uncertainty as to how issues would play out in products like gas and oil, where Russian fuel oil is an input into that historically, as governments have made it clear that as of February of 23, Russian fuel oil will no longer be provided, it no longer be consumed in Europe, we've changed the specification on our gas oil contract. And now we started to see open interest in volume starting to build again in gas oil, calendar 23 and beyond. And then you pointed out, our deep liquid options market. So options is clearly one of the most efficient ways to hedge geopolitical tail risk because it helps to hedge a number of different scenarios that could play out and embrace our volume in open or volume in Brent options, year-over-year is up 25%. So when you look at me stand your lens and look at the overall energy complex. We feel really good about how we're positioned.\nKyle Voigt: Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler at Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, good morning, everyone. So my question is on mortgage tech origination revenues were down not that surprising. But you help us with some perspective on incremental downside from current levels. And also, in terms of timing, when should we think these revenues will stabilize? And any perspective on that relative to what rates are doing would be helpful too?\nBen Jackson: Hey, Craig, it's Ben, I'll start. So basically reiterate some of the things that I said before, when you widen out what our strategy is, within the mortgage and mortgage technology business, our strategy here has been to move more and more of the revenue towards recurring to take some of that cyclicality out of the business and we continue to do that. And we've been successfully doing that. In terms of predicting the rate environment and how that's going to play out just look at how the rate environments played out over the last week, it's been extraordinarily hard for to see and be able to predict when that this volume environment and stuff will settle down. But despite that, we're going to continue to make investments in the innovation that we're providing to our clients. As we mentioned, a lot of the investments that we made is what fueled that $100 million growth that we saw over the last three years in a similar environment to what we had in 2019. Those are investments -- those investments are in and around everything that we've been doing in the closing side, our simple file business continues to gain market share and do very well. And then all of the innovation that we've been introducing on the data and analytics side with our AIQ platform, as well as the automation of the underwrite platform, we see that those are all tailwinds that regardless of the rate environment and the volume environment that our growth drivers for us.\nJeff Sprecher: And this is Jeff, let me just mention that a lot of our mortgage strategy is driven by the fact that we're trying to really position the company to be an all weather named that in all interest rate and macroeconomic environments that I can continue to end my prepared remarks on the same page that shows a graph of compounding earnings growth, for shareholders. And having a U.S. mortgage strategy gives us exposure we own LIBOR, which is the London Interbank index we trade U.K. and EU interest rate futures. We have a credit default swap business that is completely global that includes Russian sovereign, hedging and companies across the globe. We have a fixed income business that is truly global, we provide pricing data in almost every single country that has bond issuance. And we were relatively thin on having exposure to U.S. interest rates, and moving into mortgage gives us that. I also think, when we step back and look at the mortgage complex, the U.S. mortgage complex, and the way we're building the business, is that there is a demographic of millennials, that is huge, that are underserved by homeownership. And there's been supply chain issues during COVID to meet housing. And we generally believe that that any house that gets built will be sold and that there will be a mortgage on it, and that the supply chain issues are getting better and that the underperformance of building is increasing. We also have seen from our limited ownership of having mortgage assets that cash out refinancings happen when the value of homes go up, and which is an inflationary input. And the one that I think a lot of people and maybe is at the root of your question focus on is the absolute interest rate, which leads to people refinancing in a declining interest rate market. Long story short is there are a number of inputs into the housing market. We want to have exposure to the U.S. interest rate environment. It's going to help plus built in all weather name. And even with a downturn in the number of U.S. mortgages, we've had the best second quarter in our company's history.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell at Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Just a two-parter on the environmental initiatives. So maybe Ben, if you could just comment on within the energy complex, obviously, we're seeing very good strength in that gas. We did see a couple quarters now sequential declines in the environmental so the question there is, our customers substituting that gas for some of the environmental versus something else driving on the environmental side short-term? And then, the second part of the question is, if you could comment on this, maybe Lynn, but on the acquisition of Urgentem and the overall climate data strategy, whether you're seeking to get more to grow substantially in that business linking that into the data more heavily into the environmental trading side?\nBen Jackson: Got it. Thanks, Brian. Yes, I'll start and then I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll hand it to Lynn for the second part of that. So as I mentioned before, there's this confluences issues going on, in particular in Europe and where we have seen some impacts, so the balance between Russia and sanctions and the impact on the civilians and the move to cleaner energy. In Europe in specifically, we have seen some time and attention from traders that would trade things like our EUA markets, our European Union Allowances, moving and shifting more towards just the acute energy issues that everyone's faced with right now. So we have seen some headwinds in that part. But the flip side of it is in North America, we've had a very strong business continuing to do very, very well. North America is doing well and our Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiatives, our California Carbon Allowances, our renewable fuels, our REC markets, each of these are doing very, very well and we're continuing to invest. So we recently launched Biofuel Contracts they're doing well, we recently launched a global index, a Global Carbon Index Future, as well and we're getting more and more on the index itself we're getting more ETS to license and on futures are starting to develop there. We recently launched Texas Wind and Solar contracts, we recently launched nature-based offset contracts for the voluntary markets. So we see a lot of tailwinds coming in the foreseeable future, and you also have other developments like State of Pennsylvania likely to join Reggie  and Washington State likely to put in their Cap and Trade Program for the first time. So we have a lot of good tailwinds there in North America. And I think what you're seeing in the overall complex is just a wait little bit on the EUA market in Europe.\nLynn Martin: And thanks, Brian, for the follow-up question. So given the strength in our fixed income data, we're uniquely positioned to add transparency around ESG, really focused on the climate risk. Given our ability to tie alternative datasets into datasets that the market knows you've seen us further position this offering. In Q4, we announced the acquisition of risQ and Level 11, which enabled us to execute on the opportunity to turn physical climate data into actionable insights starting with our muni bond service, but more recently expanding into the mortgage-backed securities market. And now we have the ability to offer a parcel level information measured by geographic coordinates in the U.S., and we plan to expand that globally. And then, finally, as you know we recently announced the purchase of our Gen10, which really expands our climate risk offering to include corporate transition risk, given its coverage of 30,000 public and private companies, which was an attractive dataset to us to add to the climate offering.\nBrian Bedell: That's great color. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys at Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Great, thanks so much. Wanted to ask about the commodities franchise, just curious how you guys are thinking about the longer-term growth drivers there, what factors ultimately drive volumes higher in your commodities franchise, is it production of the underlying commodities, for example, some more oil and gas rigs, producing more oil and gas are going to drive volumes higher over the long-term? Just curious how you think about those growth drivers and the algorithm and how is that evolving? Thank you.\nBen Jackson: Thanks, Michael. This is Ben. And the way we think about it is, we need to have as I described earlier, that breadth of offerings of global offerings across the each of the inputs into producing energy is, as the statistics that are out there point to energy consumption doubling between now and 2050. And it's just what are the inputs into the production of that energy are going to change and will change over-time. And we believe with the breadth of offerings that we have across oil, gas, LNG, power and then the significant early start that we had and thinking about the environmental markets with the acquisition of the Climate Exchange over a decade ago, we're very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So that's one input into it. You do have a global focus on the reduction of carbon emissions around the world and as I said before, with our environmental markets, we are very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So those are two. I think the third is that even though we have had some near-term headwinds in some of the products in Europe in particular the ones that have been at the center of this Ukraine, Russia situation we continue to see user growth. So we continue to see more and more users taking data subscriptions and coming onto the platform to get visibility into what's happening in those markets, how those markets correlate, or de-correlate at times to others around the world. So when we look at the underlying health of the market, looking at user growth, looking at open interest and looking at the global breadth of the offerings that we provide to our clients, those are all inputs into our growth outlook .\nMichael Cyprys: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. Our final question is a follow-up from Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRich Repetto: Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Just one last question on mortgage, and this I think is more for Jeff. In the prepared remarks, it was mentioned about efficiency and automation and how the downturn is maybe emphasizing that more in the mortgage segment. But I guess the question, Jeff is, I think people are really looking for the connection between mortgage and how that can automate overtime as you've done so in other markets. So the question is, how is it comparing given that mortgage has a longer workflow process, but what you are seeing so far in regards to the automation of the market longer term versus the other asset classes you've dealt with?\nJeff Sprecher: Sure, that's a great question Rich, because I'm a company founder, I get asked to speak to entrepreneurs from time-to-time and I always tell them, the best time to start a business is when there's a downturn and not that having us moved into this space, you wish a downturn on anybody, but it's very, very hard to get people in finance and I say this broadly, whether it's trading, clearing, data, acquisition it is very, very hard to get people in finance to change their behavior when they're making a lot of money and when things are going well. And the best time to get people to think about making a change is when their businesses are under pressure and Ben alluded to that a number of times in why our subscription revenues are doing well in the mortgage space. Broadly speaking again, I appreciate the question. I know you've followed our company for many years, and you see us putting data and analytic tools into the mortgage market. The mortgage market that we're talking a lot about is the cash market. You've seen us and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, launch our first derivative product against in a new index that we created. And so I think this space has a lot of inefficiencies throughout the entire, not just the manufacturing the mortgage, but the way mortgages are financed and traded and retreated in the secondary market, very poor data available due to the paper based nature of the contract, difficult to regulate for regulate regulators, regulators think that there may be biases in the market, but without the right data, it's very hard to know, it's very hard to correct for the participants in the market, very expensive for consumers, banks that spend a lot of money to court a consumer, tend to lose them when there's a refinancing or a change in that client's behavior. The market is not very thoughtful about keeping connectivity between those that lend and those that borrow and all of that I think is fertile ground for us and may go for decades, honestly as we build out the infrastructure. But at the core, we need a foundation of data and information that borrowers, that lenders and that regulators can all look at and use to make it easier. I think I may have mentioned to you even that, it's odd to me that you can buy a completely consumable good, you can buy toothpaste on an online platform and when you go to checkout it'll ask you if you want to buy now and pay later, knowing that an algorithm underwrote your credit against no collateral and yet, it takes almost two months for somebody to refinance a mortgage in a house that they live in, that has a foundation that's in the ground that has an address that you can see from space that is part of the Maslow's hierarchy of need of safety and security and will be abandoned by that person, the last thing they do. And yet we, an existing mortgage talking to their bank takes two months. It just something is wrong in those equations. And we could argue that by now pay later lending maybe too generous, but certainly 60 days to do work with an existing client than an existing home just feels too long. And that's, that is the challenge that I think we will tackle successfully and put the entire industry on a better footing.\nRich Repetto: Got it. Thank you. That's helpful.\nOperator: Thank you for your question. We have received a follow up from Kyle Voigt at KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Thanks for taking my follow up. So a question on the OTC and other revenue line in the exchange segment was quite strong in the quarter. I just want to confirm that the increase that we saw there was really driven by collateral fees that ICE is clearing house or is there something else that was driving that? And can you remind us if those collateral fees are entirely fixed basis point fees, or if there is or will be any benefit from rate hikes we've seen in the U.S. and EU?\nWarren Gardiner: So hey, Kyle, it's Warren. So in terms of the OTC and other yes, you're correct that the performance there has been collateral driven that's largely from net interest income or earning at ICE Future or ICE Clear U.S. and ICE Clear Europe and so as collateral bounces move around and you've seen that over the course of this year. That's obviously going to benefit that particular line item. In terms of rates moving higher, we do have a benefit from that that's going to show up there more on -- will show up on the CDS clearing side because we do park some collateral funds there as a Fed. And so we do get a benefit as collateral moves up, but then also as Fed funds rates move up there and so that's part of the strong performance you've seen in CDS there. So, not in that OTC and other line but in the spirit of your question, yes, that there's a benefit from better rate hikes coming through over-time.\nKyle Voigt: Understood. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for your question, Kyle. This concludes our Q&A session. And now I'd like to pass over to Chair CEO, Jeff Sprecher for any final remarks.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Victoria. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me again thank my colleagues for delivering yet another record quarter and we very much appreciate and want to say thank you to our customers for putting your faith in us during the quarter.

            "content": "Thanks MC. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide four with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.32. The 14% increase year-over-year, marking the best second quarter in our company's history, and is on top of 12% growth in the second quarter of 2021. Net revenues totaled $1.8 billion, an increase of 8% versus last year, driven by a balanced contribution from both our diversified transaction revenues and our recurring revenues, which account for over half of our business and increased by 8% versus last year. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million and were at the low end of our guidance range versus the midpoint of our guide, second quarter expenses benefited from favorable FX, various expense efficiencies and lower variable costs, particularly customer acquisition costs and our listings business. Moving to the full year, we're lowering our expense guidance to a range of $2.97 billion to $2.99 billion midpoint to midpoint this represents a reduction of $35 million versus our prior guidance and similar to our second quarter results is driven by expense efficiencies, lower variable costs and favorable FX. Second quarter adjusted operating income increased by 14% to $1.1 billion their adjusted operating margin expanding to 59%. Moving to the balance sheet, shortly after we reported our first quarter results in May, we took the opportunity to raise $8 billion in new SR notes. We used 3 billion of these proceeds to refinance our 2022 and 2023 maturities and along with the proceeds from our sale of Euroclear reduced our commercial paper balances to zero with no maturities until the middle of 2025, we enter the second half of the balance sheet that is well positioned and it's an exceptionally volatile interest rate environment. The remaining $5 billion of proceeds raised in May, is earmarked to fund a portion of our announced acquisition of Black Knight based on a favorable rates that we've secured on these long-term notes, and the current forward rate expectations for both our commercial paper and term loan, we anticipate we will be well within our targeted 4% to 4.5% cost of debt financing for the transaction. It is also worth noting that alongside the financing in May, we maintained our A minus and A3 pre-acquisition ratings from both S&P and Moody's. Now let's move to Slide five, to provide an overview of the performance of our exchange segment. Second quarter exchange net revenues totaling $1 billion, an increase of 13% year-over-year, this strong performance was driven by an 80% increase in our interest rate futures, and that's 36% increase in our equity derivatives revenues. Importantly, total open interest, which we believe to be the best indicator of long-term growth, and in July up 11% versus the end of last year, including 6% growth in energy and 21% growth across our financial futures and options complex. Second quarter cash equities and equity options revenue increased by 17% year-over-year, and in July, we successfully migrated the NYCE Arca Options platform to our new pillar technology, while continuing to seamlessly process record message volume, a testament to our team's hard work and our broader technology expertise. Exchange recurring revenues increased by 7% year-over-year. This growth was driven by strong demand in our energy exchange data continued benefit from our record 2021 listings performance and a one-time accrual in our listings business that we do not expect will reoccur in the second half. Turning now to Slide six. In our fixed income and data services segment, second quarter revenue totaled a record $512 million a 13% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 78%, including 85% growth in ICE bonds, and 76% growth in our CDS clearing business. This strong growth was driven in part by customers re-engaging and allocating more capital to CDS trading, as well as our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity through our bond platforms, where we're seeing market share gains and our municipal bond business. Recurring revenue growth, which accounted for over 80% of segment revenues grew 5% in the quarter and was once again driven by strength in our consolidated fees business as well as continued growth in the ICE global network. Looking to the second half, we expect year-over-year growth in our recurring revenues to continue supported by an ASD that interest in the third quarter up over 5% year-over-year. And in that second half as reported recurring revenues, we flat to slightly up versus our first half results driven by your Euronext data center migration which was included in our original guidance and $10 million of additional FX headwinds. Shifting to mortgage technology on Slide seven. Second quarter revenues totaled $297 million. Recurring revenues which accounted for over half of the segment revenues and totaled $160 million in the quarter increased 18% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continue to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a 40% decline in origination volumes. While the current macroeconomic backdrop is challenging for a number of our customers is also presented an opportunity to have more constructive conversations around efficiency and automation across the mortgage origination workflow. It's worth noting that second quarter unit origination volumes were similar to those in the second quarter of 2019. However, second quarter 2022 revenues in our mortgage technology business were over $100 million greater or up almost 60% when compared to pro forma revenues in 2Q a\u0302\u0080\u009819. This is a clear testament to the continued automation and growth and customer adoption of our solutions across the origination workflow. I'll conclude on Slide eight. To the first half of the year, we've grown total ICE revenue by 7% adjusted operating income by 11%, including 200 basis points of margin expansion and adjusted earnings per share by 12%, representing the best first half in our history. In addition, we've positioned our balance sheet for the acquisition of Black Knight while also growing our dividend and continuing to invest in future growth. As we look to the balance of the year, we're excited about the many growth opportunities in front of us, and we remain focused on creating value for our stockholders. With that, I'll hand it over to Ben. And then, Rich, its Warren on your question on the recurring revenues. You're right. That's FX, largely FX, there's also a little bit of AUM related revenue in our ETF business. So as we saw during the quarter people shifting into treasuries and out of equities, and some of the credit focused ETFs. There's lower economics on those treasury ETFs that we bent that track our benchmarks and so that was a little bit of a mix shift impact for us as well within the AUM portion of the index. The rest of the index business did really well during the quarter up double digits. Again, some of the subscription revenue, pure subscription revenue, if you will, in there. So really just kind of the macro dynamics taking hold there that why you saw that slight sequential decline. Alex, this is Warren, you asked about the guidance. So yes, you're correct. There's no change to the guidance that we gave to start the year. We did assume, as we said back then that there will be some headwinds from people potentially going out of business or maybe not as many new market participants, I'll say I'm highly confident that to the extent that starts to play out, that's going to be a cyclical trend, not a secular one, because I think if you think about the process for and this is reiterating what Ben just said, we think about the rest of getting a mortgage, it continues to be very costly for the consumer, it's very inefficient. And we have the tools that are -- building the tools that are really solving those problems. And so I know that probably doesn't help, solve for 2022, EPS or 2023 EPS, but it should really factor into kind of the multiple people are thinking about when you're valuing the overall enterprise at the end of the day. So hey, Kyle, it's Warren. So in terms of the OTC and other yes, you're correct that the performance there has been collateral driven that's largely from net interest income or earning at ICE Future or ICE Clear U.S. and ICE Clear Europe and so as collateral bounces move around and you've seen that over the course of this year. That's obviously going to benefit that particular line item. In terms of rates moving higher, we do have a benefit from that that's going to show up there more on -- will show up on the CDS clearing side because we do park some collateral funds there as a Fed. And so we do get a benefit as collateral moves up, but then also as Fed funds rates move up there and so that's part of the strong performance you've seen in CDS there. So, not in that OTC and other line but in the spirit of your question, yes, that there's a benefit from better rate hikes coming through over-time."

            "content": "Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. The first half of the year has been marked by rising inflation, rising interest rates and continued geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Our customers are navigating evolving risks and continued to rely on our data, technology and liquid markets to manage these risks. In the second quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income, and grew adjusted earnings per share these record setting second quarter results reflect the strength of our network and the all weather nature of our business model. Our strategy has always been to find unique and novel ways to apply data and technology to bring efficiencies and transparency to markets whether it was moving energy trading to the screen, clearing OTC swaps, modernizing the technology powering the U.S. equity markets, or building datasets for the opaque fixed income markets. As we've grown and diversified, we've broadened our opportunity set and our expertise has grown, providing new markets to grow into, and importantly, new ways to provide innovative solutions to customers. We've leveraged our leading pricing and reference data to build new tools for the front office. We've married our fixed income data to newly expanded climate capabilities. And more recently, we've combined our expertise in futures contract construction, with our index capabilities, and with our unique mortgage data to launch both the ICE mortgage rate lock index and its associated futures contract. These are just a few examples of the innovation that we can deliver with our expanded technology, datasets and expertise. Our evolution has been intentional, diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues with the goal of building a business that today generates compounding earnings growth. It's how we've grown our adjusted earnings per share for the past 15 years in every year that we've been a public company. The net result of our compounding earnings growth is the compounding growth in our dividend, which we've grown double digits each year on average since we initiated it in 2013 and which we also grew 15% in this quarter. Looking now to the second half of the year and beyond, we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us. And we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers while driving compounding growth for our stockholders. I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business and their trust and I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our record second quarter, following on the heels of our best first quarter, making this an unsurpassed first half result for our company. With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator Victoria, and will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Hi, Rich. I'm going to hand it over to Lynn to go through this. And this is Jeff, let me just mention that a lot of our mortgage strategy is driven by the fact that we're trying to really position the company to be an all weather named that in all interest rate and macroeconomic environments that I can continue to end my prepared remarks on the same page that shows a graph of compounding earnings growth, for shareholders. And having a U.S. mortgage strategy gives us exposure we own LIBOR, which is the London Interbank index we trade U.K. and EU interest rate futures. We have a credit default swap business that is completely global that includes Russian sovereign, hedging and companies across the globe. We have a fixed income business that is truly global, we provide pricing data in almost every single country that has bond issuance. And we were relatively thin on having exposure to U.S. interest rates, and moving into mortgage gives us that. I also think, when we step back and look at the mortgage complex, the U.S. mortgage complex, and the way we're building the business, is that there is a demographic of millennials, that is huge, that are underserved by homeownership. And there's been supply chain issues during COVID to meet housing. And we generally believe that that any house that gets built will be sold and that there will be a mortgage on it, and that the supply chain issues are getting better and that the underperformance of building is increasing. We also have seen from our limited ownership of having mortgage assets that cash out refinancings happen when the value of homes go up, and which is an inflationary input. And the one that I think a lot of people and maybe is at the root of your question focus on is the absolute interest rate, which leads to people refinancing in a declining interest rate market. Long story short is there are a number of inputs into the housing market. We want to have exposure to the U.S. interest rate environment. It's going to help plus built in all weather name. And even with a downturn in the number of U.S. mortgages, we've had the best second quarter in our company's history. Sure, that's a great question Rich, because I'm a company founder, I get asked to speak to entrepreneurs from time-to-time and I always tell them, the best time to start a business is when there's a downturn and not that having us moved into this space, you wish a downturn on anybody, but it's very, very hard to get people in finance and I say this broadly, whether it's trading, clearing, data, acquisition it is very, very hard to get people in finance to change their behavior when they're making a lot of money and when things are going well. And the best time to get people to think about making a change is when their businesses are under pressure and Ben alluded to that a number of times in why our subscription revenues are doing well in the mortgage space. Broadly speaking again, I appreciate the question. I know you've followed our company for many years, and you see us putting data and analytic tools into the mortgage market. The mortgage market that we're talking a lot about is the cash market. You've seen us and I mentioned in my prepared remarks, launch our first derivative product against in a new index that we created. And so I think this space has a lot of inefficiencies throughout the entire, not just the manufacturing the mortgage, but the way mortgages are financed and traded and retreated in the secondary market, very poor data available due to the paper based nature of the contract, difficult to regulate for regulate regulators, regulators think that there may be biases in the market, but without the right data, it's very hard to know, it's very hard to correct for the participants in the market, very expensive for consumers, banks that spend a lot of money to court a consumer, tend to lose them when there's a refinancing or a change in that client's behavior. The market is not very thoughtful about keeping connectivity between those that lend and those that borrow and all of that I think is fertile ground for us and may go for decades, honestly as we build out the infrastructure. But at the core, we need a foundation of data and information that borrowers, that lenders and that regulators can all look at and use to make it easier. I think I may have mentioned to you even that, it's odd to me that you can buy a completely consumable good, you can buy toothpaste on an online platform and when you go to checkout it'll ask you if you want to buy now and pay later, knowing that an algorithm underwrote your credit against no collateral and yet, it takes almost two months for somebody to refinance a mortgage in a house that they live in, that has a foundation that's in the ground that has an address that you can see from space that is part of the Maslow's hierarchy of need of safety and security and will be abandoned by that person, the last thing they do. And yet we, an existing mortgage talking to their bank takes two months. It just something is wrong in those equations. And we could argue that by now pay later lending maybe too generous, but certainly 60 days to do work with an existing client than an existing home just feels too long. And that's, that is the challenge that I think we will tackle successfully and put the entire industry on a better footing. Thank you, Victoria. Thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me again thank my colleagues for delivering yet another record quarter and we very much appreciate and want to say thank you to our customers for putting your faith in us during the quarter. We'll look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to execute on these exciting growth opportunities that we mentioned on the call. And with that, I hope you'll have a great day."

            "name": "Lynn Martin",
            "content": "Hi, Rich. Thanks for the question. You're right that we saw strong growth in our fixed income trading business this quarter. And as mentioned in our prepared remarks that was driven off of strengthened our muni trading business. And while volatility and the return of retail has certainly been a contributor, we're seeing our institutional efforts pay off. As you are aware over the last two years, we really focused on leveraging our market leading assets in the muni ecosystem, including our data assets and our index business, which now serves as the benchmark for more than 60% of the AUM in this area to build out the infrastructure to connect the institutional market to our muni execution platforms. And in this quarter alone, we're seeing the benefits of that work manifest itself. And that institutional share within our muni execution platforms has doubled since 2020, enabling us to take share in the broader muni market. And finally, it's worth noting that our institutional business in munis has grown 250%, year-over-year, a further sign that we're gaining share in this asset class. And thanks, Brian, for the follow-up question. So given the strength in our fixed income data, we're uniquely positioned to add transparency around ESG, really focused on the climate risk. Given our ability to tie alternative datasets into datasets that the market knows you've seen us further position this offering. In Q4, we announced the acquisition of risQ and Level 11, which enabled us to execute on the opportunity to turn physical climate data into actionable insights starting with our muni bond service, but more recently expanding into the mortgage-backed securities market. And now we have the ability to offer a parcel level information measured by geographic coordinates in the U.S., and we plan to expand that globally. And then, finally, as you know we recently announced the purchase of our Gen10, which really expands our climate risk offering to include corporate transition risk, given its coverage of 30,000 public and private companies, which was an attractive dataset to us to add to the climate offering."

            "name": "Ben Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren. And thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide nine. Rising inflation has created an interest rate environment, many of our customers have not navigated in over a decade. Meanwhile, the continued war in Ukraine has triggered a reshaping of the global energy supply chain, creating new risks and uncertainties for market participants. Importantly, we remain focused on connecting customers to our leading technology, mission critical data, and transparent and accessible markets to navigate these uncertain conditions. In our interest rate markets, we've seen record year-to-date volumes in our your  contract as customers increasingly seek to manage risks associated with rising rates and central bank activity across Europe and the U.K. This heightened risk has also contributed to strength in our equity derivatives complex, driving an 18% increase in volumes year-to-date. Across our global energy markets, customers are navigating supply uncertainty alongside longer term Clean Energy Transition priorities. This will continue to introduce additional complexity and volatility to energy markets, which should drive greater demand for risk management. And it is our diverse global energy markets that provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools customers need to navigate both the near-term and long-term complexities. Globalization of gas and the clean energy transition are trends that have contributed to the 43% average annual volume growth in our TTF gas business over the past five years, driving TTF to emerge as a global gas benchmark. Through the first half of this year, as a result of the Russia Ukraine conflict, global gas markets have tightened significantly, increasing the demand for global liquefied natural gas in an uncertain geopolitical environment. This volatility and uncertainty has driven our global gas volumes increased 31% year-to-date, including 49% growth in our North American gas business in the second quarter. Commercial customers continue to rely on our markets to manage their risk, as evidenced by the record share in open interest we've achieved in our Henry Hub contract, surpassing 50% for the first time ever. Because we operate a global gas market with benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia, we are well positioned to benefit from both the near- term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets. Despite these global energy concerns, governments, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. As such, valuing externalities such as placing a price on pollution, carbon free electricity, and carbon sequestration and storage will continue to increase in importance. ICE has one of the largest networks of environmental products to value such externalities across the carbon cycle, including renewable fuel contracts, carbon allowances, nature-based solutions, and renewable energy certificates. The breadth of our complex, coupled with the growing importance of carbon price transparency, has contributed to the 19% average annual volume growth in our environmental complex over the past five years. As the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmental alongside our gas and oil complexes will provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to manage these evolving risks. Turning now to our mortgage business. I first want to touch on our pending acquisition of Black Knight as announced on May 4 of this year. As we said, when we made our announcement back then we continued to believe the transaction will close during the first half of 2023. Since the announcement, and in accordance with our initial expected timeline, we have submitted the necessary regulatory filings. We are working with the FTC as they perform their thoughtful and comprehensive reviews of the proposed transaction. Out of respect for the FTC is important work on this matter as we work with them toward regulatory approval, we do not intend to comment further on the transaction. But importantly, we remain very excited about the efficiencies that combined entities will bring to the end consumer and other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem. As interest rates rise, and mortgage origination volumes soften from recent record levels, our customers continue to turn to our mission critical technology to operate more efficiently. In the second quarter, we once again grew recurring revenues and outperformed the broader industry. Our focus during these evolving market conditions is first and foremost, our customer. Customer conversations have increasingly centered on efficiencies and automation and we continued to work with our customers to find the most efficient ways they can benefit from the breadth of offerings across our network. For example, we recently made the decision to offer interested customers our base eCO solution included in an Encompass subscription, making it easier and cheaper for customers to adopt and benefit from the efficiencies from an electronic closing. To focus on efficiencies has also led to increased interest in our data and analytics products, leveraging machine learning technology, our analytics platform automates the steps in the loan manufacturing process, and can save lenders 1000s of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity. Year-to-date, our data analytics business, which is made up largely of recurring revenues, has grown 21% year-over-year, we continue to see increased adoption of our analytics and new customers coming onto the platform, with a host of new clients added this year alone represented the likes of Chase, a number of leading independent mortgage bankers, and a top three home builder. We are pleased that the value of our offerings continues to resonate with lenders, and we remain optimistic about the long-term opportunity to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening across the mortgage industry. I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Yes, that's a lot Alex. This is Ben. I'll start and Warren will also I'm sure add in here. So in terms of, I'll start with this, just the overall challenges in the environment. If you take a step back, and you look at what we're building, we're building a business here that in mortgage whether a number of different market environments with an eye towards an 8% to 10% growth over the long-haul. And why are we confident in our ability to do that is the reasons are one we have absolutely mission critical software for these clients that we're providing. We have long-term contracts with our clients, four to five years of the high amount of retention in them. And we are heavily focused, as you've seen in our results, on shifting the revenue to more and more towards recurring. And we did it again this quarter, on the backdrop of 40% down market in terms of volumes, with 18% year-over-year recurring revenue growth in the business. The other Proofpoint, you've seen in terms of being able to weather various market environments is our data analytics line item. With that being up 36% last quarter alone. And one of the key inputs and drivers to that is our AIQ and analyzer solutions, we're seeing tremendous uptake in that we're seeing clients now more than ever just looking to adopt automation to automate as much of the workflow as possible to lower their costs. And the other proof point I put out, there was a comment Warren made in his prepared remarks, in that if you look at Q2 of 2019, very similar volume environment to what we saw in this past quarter, we generated more than $100 million of revenue on a pro forma basis. And that's, what enables us to do as we do time studies, with our clients, and clients that adopt our full automation suite, we see are saving anywhere from 570 to $1,400 per loan that they're manufacturing when they adopt our solutions. So our ability to capture some benefit from that from the efficiencies that we're providing to the industry has been tremendous. In terms of the algorithm of growth, on recurring revenue, it's really -- it's a mix that we've described before, it's a mix of, there is some pricing in there, there is sales to new clients. So I mentioned, we had a good start of the year for sales on Encompass. We've had a good sales for the year on our AIQ business. And then also the other input is that shift as customers are renewing that shift of -- even if we have to forego some transaction revenue of moving more to subscription, we're continuing to do that, and have a lot of success. And we're still early days, we're really in the first year of a codified program to do that. And with contracts with clients going four to five years in the future we have a long runway to go. Hey, Alex. It's Ben again. So we have seen a small, small number of lenders that have had some challenges and potentially go out of business, but it's a very small number that we've seen so far. Hey, Kyle, it's Ben. So you have a -- we have a confluence of issues that are going on around the world that are really unprecedented. And against that backdrop, we're pleased that our overall, our overall futures business is up for year-over-year in terms of open interest and since the end of the year, and our energy businesses up in open interest since the end of the year, given all of these events. And what are we looking at, we're looking at an inflationary environment, we're looking at a recession, you've got in particular in Europe, governments in Europe, have to figure out the balance between sanctions against Russia, the impact of those sanctions against their civilians, in terms of near-term price impact on energy, and move towards cleaner energy. So you've got this pothole mix and then you also have in China continued COVID lockdowns that are happening, and obviously geopolitical tensions happening with China. So given all those issues, we believe that our marketplace has been set up as best as can be in the in the world to help clients navigate through all of these events, and they're utilizing us to do that. And I'll give a few examples. So first, we have one of the most deep and liquid markets across that energy spectrum. So think of oil, gas, LNG, power and environmentals. So as clients are looking to move and switch between fuels, looking towards, moving towards a cleaner environment, we are the exchange and clearing businesses that they're going to do that. Second, in managing global supply shocks, you have deep -- we have deep liquid global markets in each of those respective asset classes that I mentioned with oil, gas, LNG, power, and environmentals and enable customers because we have all these deep liquid points at the points of production and consumption, as clients need to hedge their risks using different risk management tools. We're very well positioned to do that. And a perfect example is right now with Russia, stifling gas supplies going into Europe, we are seeing U.S. step in and U.S. providing natural gas via LNG cargos going into Northern Europe. And given that we are the home to the vast majority of commercial traders, that trade our U.S. gas products, both Henry Hub and our bases markets, we're seeing clients use that to hedge those cargos. And it's one of the inputs that's led to what I mentioned in my prepared remarks of the record we've seen in market share from a Henry Hub perspective, as well as a North American gas and at a highest well in the global gas complex. The third thing I'd point out is that we're engaged as much as ever with clients and governments around the world around the sanctions and as they're taking shape. And there's no question it had some impact, as there was uncertainty as to how issues would play out in products like gas and oil, where Russian fuel oil is an input into that historically, as governments have made it clear that as of February of 23, Russian fuel oil will no longer be provided, it no longer be consumed in Europe, we've changed the specification on our gas oil contract. And now we started to see open interest in volume starting to build again in gas oil, calendar 23 and beyond. And then you pointed out, our deep liquid options market. So options is clearly one of the most efficient ways to hedge geopolitical tail risk because it helps to hedge a number of different scenarios that could play out and embrace our volume in open or volume in Brent options, year-over-year is up 25%. So when you look at me stand your lens and look at the overall energy complex. We feel really good about how we're positioned. Hey, Craig, it's Ben, I'll start. So basically reiterate some of the things that I said before, when you widen out what our strategy is, within the mortgage and mortgage technology business, our strategy here has been to move more and more of the revenue towards recurring to take some of that cyclicality out of the business and we continue to do that. And we've been successfully doing that. In terms of predicting the rate environment and how that's going to play out just look at how the rate environments played out over the last week, it's been extraordinarily hard for to see and be able to predict when that this volume environment and stuff will settle down. But despite that, we're going to continue to make investments in the innovation that we're providing to our clients. As we mentioned, a lot of the investments that we made is what fueled that $100 million growth that we saw over the last three years in a similar environment to what we had in 2019. Those are investments -- those investments are in and around everything that we've been doing in the closing side, our simple file business continues to gain market share and do very well. And then all of the innovation that we've been introducing on the data and analytics side with our AIQ platform, as well as the automation of the underwrite platform, we see that those are all tailwinds that regardless of the rate environment and the volume environment that our growth drivers for us. Got it. Thanks, Brian. Yes, I'll start and then Ia\u0302\u0080\u0099ll hand it to Lynn for the second part of that. So as I mentioned before, there's this confluences issues going on, in particular in Europe and where we have seen some impacts, so the balance between Russia and sanctions and the impact on the civilians and the move to cleaner energy. In Europe in specifically, we have seen some time and attention from traders that would trade things like our EUA markets, our European Union Allowances, moving and shifting more towards just the acute energy issues that everyone's faced with right now. So we have seen some headwinds in that part. But the flip side of it is in North America, we've had a very strong business continuing to do very, very well. North America is doing well and our Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiatives, our California Carbon Allowances, our renewable fuels, our REC markets, each of these are doing very, very well and we're continuing to invest. So we recently launched Biofuel Contracts they're doing well, we recently launched a global index, a Global Carbon Index Future, as well and we're getting more and more on the index itself we're getting more ETS to license and on futures are starting to develop there. We recently launched Texas Wind and Solar contracts, we recently launched nature-based offset contracts for the voluntary markets. So we see a lot of tailwinds coming in the foreseeable future, and you also have other developments like State of Pennsylvania likely to join Reggie  and Washington State likely to put in their Cap and Trade Program for the first time. So we have a lot of good tailwinds there in North America. And I think what you're seeing in the overall complex is just a wait little bit on the EUA market in Europe. Thanks, Michael. This is Ben. And the way we think about it is, we need to have as I described earlier, that breadth of offerings of global offerings across the each of the inputs into producing energy is, as the statistics that are out there point to energy consumption doubling between now and 2050. And it's just what are the inputs into the production of that energy are going to change and will change over-time. And we believe with the breadth of offerings that we have across oil, gas, LNG, power and then the significant early start that we had and thinking about the environmental markets with the acquisition of the Climate Exchange over a decade ago, we're very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So that's one input into it. You do have a global focus on the reduction of carbon emissions around the world and as I said before, with our environmental markets, we are very well positioned to help clients navigate through that. So those are two. I think the third is that even though we have had some near-term headwinds in some of the products in Europe in particular the ones that have been at the center of this Ukraine, Russia situation we continue to see user growth. So we continue to see more and more users taking data subscriptions and coming onto the platform to get visibility into what's happening in those markets, how those markets correlate, or de-correlate at times to others around the world. So when we look at the underlying health of the market, looking at user growth, looking at open interest and looking at the global breadth of the offerings that we provide to our clients, those are all inputs into our growth outlook ."

I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks MC. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on slide four of the earnings supplement with some quick highlights from our first quarter results and I'll turn it over to Jeff to discuss the exciting transaction we announced yesterday afternoon. First quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.43, up 7% year-over-year, marking the best quarter in our company's history. Net revenues totaled a record $1.9 billion, an increase of 6% versus last year. Total transaction revenues grew 4%, while total recurring revenues which accounted for nearly half of our business increased by 9%. Importantly, this is on top of 10% growth in the first quarter of 2021. First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $746 million in the middle of our guidance range. Had it not been for a few million dollars of severance, adjusted operating expenses would have been towards the lower end of the range. Looking to the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $740 million to $750 million. First quarter adjusted operating income increased by 9% to a record $1.2 billion. While free cash flow totaled $660 million, which we largely deployed in the form of share repurchases of $475 million. Now let\u2019s move to slide five, where I\u2019ll provide a quick overview of the performance of each of our segments. First quarter exchange net revenues totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 36% increase in our interest rate futures and a 16% increase in our energy revenues. Revenues within our global natural gas and environmental products which represent approximately 40% of energy revenues increased by 30% in the quarter. Recurring revenues which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business increased by 7% year-over-year, including 13% growth in listings. Turning now to slide six, in our fixed income and data services segment first quarter revenues totaled a record $509 million, a 9% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 28%, including 9% revenue growth in ICE bonds and 33% growth in our CDS business, driven by rising interest rates and macro-economic uncertainty. Recurring revenue growth which accounted for nearly 85% of segment revenues grew by 6% in the quarter, once again driven by double digit growth in our index and consolidated feeds businesses, and strong performance from our ICE Global Network and other data services businesses. And importantly, annual subscription value or ASV enters the second quarter up over 6% year-over-year. Shifting to Mortgage Technology on slide seven, first quarter revenues totaled $307 million, while total mortgage technology revenues declined year-over-year in the first quarter. We once again outperformed an industry that experienced a 40% decline in origination volumes, including an 80% decline in term refi volume. Recurring revenues which accounted for over half of segment revenues, totaled $156 million and grew 24% year-over-year. As the mortgage origination backdrop continues to normalize, customers are in search of both automation and greater efficiency, a trend that contribute to one of the strongest sales quarters for our data and analytics product suite, including the implementation of our analyzers by J.P. Morgan Chase. In addition, based on the strong performance through the first quarter of 2022 and the visibility we have into the current sales pipeline, we believe our current revenue growth in our mortgage business is trending towards the high end of our low to mid-teens guidance range. In summary, while a rapid rise in interest rates may have weighed on mortgage transaction volumes during the quarter, that same macroeconomic factor also provided a tailwind to our interest rate, commodity and fixed income businesses. And once again alongside strong growth across our recurring revenue base, helps us deliver another record quarter for revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, a testament to the all-weather nature of our business model. With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff.\nJeff Sprecher : Thank you, Warren. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we're here to discuss the financial results of the best quarter in ICE\u2019s history, along with our plan to continue our track record of growth with our agreement to acquire the public company Black Knight. Black Knight is an important piece of financial market infrastructure that we believe will allow us to continue to reduce the cost of home borrowing, when coupled to the other U.S. mortgage industry assets that we built and acquired. This proposed acquisition is another step in a journey that ICE has embarked on since its founding. As an early entrepreneur, I studied the exchange space and I discovered that the largest exchanges all had one asset class in common, interest rates. And what became abundantly clear during the financial crisis was that hedgers who thought they had affectively managed risk using legacy interest rate products were doing so very imperfectly. Couple that with the analog to digital conversion that's been happening to markets more broadly, and we saw a powerful opportunity to redefine our exchange business, and we've been diligently working on this thesis for more than 15 years. To compete with hedging products in the corporate borrowing area, we acquired Creditex in 2008, married it with a Board of Trade Clearing Corporation in 2009 and launched a clear credit default swap market that this quarter generated $72 million of revenue and grew 33% year-over-year. We acquired the Life Exchange in 2013 and revenue from its interest rate products grew 36% in the quarter. We acquired Interactive Data Corporation in 2015, and married it to the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Credit and Bond Index business in 2017, to build tools and launch a powerful suite of corporate borrowing indices and reference data. We doubled the revenue growth in those businesses to an average annual rate of 6%. In the consumer lending area, because the largest amounts of consumer borrowing are tied to home mortgages, we pursued opportunities in the U.S. mortgage space, acquiring the Mortgage Electronic Registry Service in 2018, Simplifile in 2019 and Ellie Mae in 2020. When coupled together, these technologies can offer lenders the potential to shorten the time that it holds interest rate risk, market exposure, from the time of the consumer rate lock until the time of wholesale funding, fundamentally changing the risk profile for lenders. And by leveraging our data expertise across the company, we recently created the ICE Rate Lock Index and have announced that we're launching a Futures contract on it in the coming weeks, creating an even more precise interest rate risk management tool. Now, by adding Black Knight to our solutions set, we have the potential to further improve the capital market ecosystem that surrounds the funding of U.S. Home Mortgages. De-risking these markets for participants by shortening the duration when interest rate risks are held, making data more transparent to the risk holders and creating more efficient hedging markets for those involved should ultimately lower the cost for the entire market. There's no question that our thesis of producing better interest rate products and tools has been proven out, as we have transformed the way risk is managed in the markets we serve, and our thesis continues to compound on growth as we innovate new interest rate hedging tools. So let me now ask you to turn to slide six of the ICE and Black Knight transaction deck. Yesterday afternoon we announced that ICE has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Black Knight for $85 per share or a market value of $13 billion. Consideration is expected to be in the form of a mix of 80% cash and 20% stock and the transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year following its completion. Warren will discuss the financials in more detail, but first I'll discuss the strategic rationale of this very exciting transaction. Black Knight is a premier provider of Integrated, Mission Critical, Software Solutions and Data and Analytics that serve the U.S. Mortgage and Real Estate Markets. Black Knight suite of solutions span across the mortgage work-flow and are highly complementary to ICE\u2019s existing businesses. By expanding our solution set beyond originations, we will be able to deliver a life of loan platform that reduces friction and drives transparency across the workflow. The integration of our solutions will strengthen the overall mortgage ecosystem, bringing more choice and delivering efficiencies for lenders, servicers, partners and ultimately the end consumer. This combination will also expand the addressable market in our mortgage business to $14 billion, and better positions us to penetrate our existing $10 billion TAM. Black Knight will complement our all-weather business model, with a high growth and highly recurring revenue base. And finally, we will leverage ICE\u2019s technology expertise to modernize Black Knight\u2019s technology stack, while tightly integrating our offerings to enable the many opportunities that are in front of us. Turning to slide seven. Much like the history and culture at ICE, Black Knight\u2019s mission focuses on customer service and product excellence. The expansive product suite and compelling value proposition Black Knight brings to its customer base has enabled consistent revenue and EBITDA growth, a trend that we believe will only continue as a part of ICE. Moving now to slide eight, you'll find a summary overview of our strategic rationale, which I'll discuss in more detail with the subsequent slides, beginning now on slide nine. The opportunity we see in the mortgage space is much like the opportunities that we're executing against other interest rate markets and asset classes, by integrating data and technology across the entire work flow, to bring greater transparency and efficiencies to the broader ecosystem. The very manual loan origination process and its extensive regulatory oversight has driven the cost to originate a U.S. home mortgage in nearly $9,000, with approximately one quarter of that amount being related to customer acquisition costs. As a result, more lenders are beginning to retain the servicing rights of the mortgages that they originate to recapture previous customers and reduce their acquisition costs. By connecting Black Knight servicing system to the underwriting automation and consumer engagement solutions at ICE, we have an opportunity to create a life of loan platform that will enable lenders to realize a customer for life. This connection will lower the acquisition costs for lenders, enabling those savings to be passed on to the consumer. Turning now to slide 10. Data is a core competency at ICE, from our earliest days we recognize the value of leveraging data to drive transparency, and we continue to build on that expertise by broadening our datasets, connecting data across asset classes and innovating for our customers. The data sets that exists across the complementary businesses of ICE and Black Knight present an untapped opportunity to apply that same playbook within home mortgage. With access to solutions such as Black Knight\u2019s MLS listing services and real-estate data, we\u2019ll have a presence in the home search process. In addition, there's an opportunity to leverage Black Knight\u2019s tax data and property valuation analytics to further enhance the underwriting process and provide our customers additional insights into rapidly changing market dynamics. We\u2019ll also have the opportunity to expand our existing ICE Mortgage Technology Solutions set into secondary markets, increasing the transparency for servicers and investors, by enabling them to better understand their portfolio valuations, performance and risk. And by combining this rich data with ICE\u2019s expertise in fixed income and capital markets, we\u2019ll be able to provide even greater transparency to the fixed income markets through transaction based data for more accurate pricing and prepayment modeling. Turning now to slide 11. As we've demonstrated in our other asset classes, the integration of data and technology across the mortgage workflow should enable greater automation and in turn reduce friction to help lower the cost to originate our home mortgage for all parties, ultimately making our loan more affordable and accessible for the American home buyer. By adding content to our Consumer Engagement Solutions, we plan to provide consumers and investor\u2019s greater clarity and insight into unique loan products, and the key metrics that impact homeownership such as interest rate levels in lending policies, ultimately improving the overall home buying experience for the consumer. Lenders will also be able to proactively underwrite current customers for future home lending opportunities, by helping consumers lower their housing payments by refinancing out of additional interest rate overlays or reducing their risk adjustments to the original mortgage. And leveraging common datasets across the entire mortgage cycle could reduce data entry errors and erroneous fees that today impact consumers directly. We also see an opportunity to develop innovative analytics, helping lenders connect with potential buyers in historically underserved markets, and identify minority bias in the home valuation process. These are just a few of the many examples, of the many opportunities that we see to leverage our data and technology to support potential homeowners, and make the dream of home ownership a reality. Moving to slide 12, the work flow efficiencies, this combination will deliver underpin and expanded addressable market of $14 billion, including $2 billion from servicing solutions and an additional $2 billion within data and analytics. Our combined businesses will bolster our point of sale and Consumer Engagement Solutions, enabling us to better serve that portion of our existing TAM. In order to provide you with additional transparency into this opportunity, we've separated this $2 billion addressable market from the application processing and underwriting segment, which here is largely made up of our Loan Origination Technology. Black Knight also brings capabilities that will allow us to access part of our existing TAM that we don't have a solution for today such as their hedging and trading platform. These capabilities combined with our deep expertise in trading and clearing unlock our longer term opportunity to improve transparency for the secondary market participants in the form of a loan exchange. And finally, we\u2019ll be better positioned to monetize our current $10 billion TAM to opportunities to promote existing products across an expanded customer base. Moving to Slide 13. Black Knight\u2019s highly recurring, more predictable revenues will complement ICE's existing revenue streams and increase our mix of high growth recurring revenues. Within ICE Mortgage Technology, our mix of recurring revenues will increase from roughly 50% to approximately 70% and total ICE revenues will now be over 50% recurring on a pro forma basis. Importantly, these high growth recurring revenues are underpinned by mission critical data, and technology that's embedded in our customers workflows, and by adding more stable revenue streams to our current mortgage technology revenues, we will improve the visibility and durability of our earnings and cash flow, further complementaring our all-weather business model. Let me now turn the call back over to Warren, and he'll discuss the financial details of today's transaction.\nWarren Gardiner : Thanks Jeff. Please turn to slide 14. As Jeff noted, yesterday we announced we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Black Knight for $85 per share or market value of $13 billion. The share prices in line with Black Knight\u2019s 52 week high just achieved on December 30, 2021 represents a fully synergized EV to EBITDA multiple of approximately 15x forward. We anticipate the transaction will be accretive to ICE\u2019s adjusted earnings per share in the first year post close, with adjusted earnings accretion accelerating thereafter. Embedded within our purchase value are cost synergies of approximately $200 million, with one-third realized in year one, two-thirds by year three and 100% by year five. These cost synergies are expected to be driven by the integration of corporate functions, real-estate optimization and a more efficient use of shared services across the combined platform. When combined with the remaining Ellie Mae synergies, total expected cost synergies represent approximately 15% of the pro forma IMT Black Knight expense base. Shifting to revenues, we've underwritten approximately $125 million of net revenue synergies by year five, representing roughly 1% of our expanded $14 billion addressable market. These synergies will largely be driven by cross sell of existing products across our expanded customer base. Transaction consideration will come in the form of 80% cash and 20% stock. The plan to finance the cash component through a combination of commercial paper, newly issued debt and cash on hand at the time of close, which we currently anticipate will be in the first half of 2023. Gross leverage at close is expected to temporarily peak at approximately 4.1x pro forma EBITDA, which is below the 4.25 peak leverage we reached with Ellie Mae. We believe this financing structure demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a solid investment grade rating, and as of this week we've elected to spend share purchases until our leverage falls below 3.25x, which we anticipate will be towards the end of 2024. You will note on appendix slide 24, our strong track record of deleveraging post acquisition. As with Ellie Mae, we are targeting normalized leverage levels in the 2.75 to 3 range. We believe our enhanced cash flow generation will allow us to achieve this deleveraging path, even as we continue to invest in our business and our people, while also continuing to grow our dividend. Moving to slide 15. Based on first quarter results and pro forma for Black Knight, we expect that our mortgage segment will represent approximately 30% of total Ice revenues compared to 16% previously. Recurring revenues within our mortgage segment are expected to account for nearly 40% of total ICE recurring revenues, where our mortgage transaction revenues will represent only 10% of total ICE revenues. In addition, on close we anticipate providing additional metrics to help investors better understand the progress we are making as a combined platform, and the secular growth opportunities that underpin the analog to digital conversion occurring within the mortgage space. With that, I'm happy to take your questions in Q&A. But I\u2019ll first turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments.\nJeff Sprecher : Thank you, Warren. I'll conclude my remarks on slide 16. Since our founding, ICE has operated with a strategy to build tools and markets for institutions and consumers, which operate in the white space of the inefficiencies of legacy markets, and we seek to do this smartly, in a manner that enables us to grow our earnings in all economic and interest rate conditions, so that ICE is truly an all-weather growth story, something that does not exist in a single market or asset class alone. This vision is one that we continue to organically build out ourselves, but one only has to look at our acquisition history, including my original acquisition of the founding company to ICE, to see that its valuable assets become available to us at prices that meet our disciplined M&A criteria, than will accelerate our build out plans by our acquisition. And through thoughtful integration, leveraging the infrastructure and expertise of the acquired company, we advance our vision and accelerate our goals to fundamentally transform the markets in which we operate. Our proposed acquisition of Black Knight is another important piece of this vision. I'll now turn the call back to our moderator Betsy, and we\u2019ll conduct the question-and-answer session.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Rich Repetto with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nRich Repetto: Yeah, good morning Jeff, and good morning Warren, and congrats on the announcement of the acquisition. So I guess probably the first reaction we get from investors in this space you know was on the regulatory risks and the anti-trust potential issues. So I guess Jeff the question is, you know how comfortable are you with this anti-trust risk? Do you think the front end, the LOS systems, do you think you'll have to divest of anything to get this deal through and what kind of impact would you expect if you do?\nA - Jeff Sprecher: Sure. Rich, I\u2019m joined here by Ben Jackson and Joe Tyrrell who are going to run these businesses for us, so let me turn it over to Ben.\nBen Jackson: Hey Rich! Good question and you know obviously it's a large deal, so we expect it to take time for regulators to understand the complementary nature of our two businesses. But at the end of the day we're confident that they'll come into the same conclusion that we did, and also we had and as well as Black Knight had legal counsel look at this in detail, and came to the conclusion that these are 100% complementary businesses that service different parts of the mortgage ecosystem. And at the end of the day, and you heard it through the prepared comments through Jeff's comments today, that bringing these businesses together is the best way to further advance innovation in the mortgage industry and bring efficiencies that are desperately needed to the servicers, to originators and then through to the end customer. And when I say that the businesses are complementary and Jeff referred to slide nine in the deck when he was going through it, which I think is a great picture of it. You can see that with Black Knight\u2019s businesses, they start really in the front end on the real estate side where we do not have assets, and then they pick up again post the closing process where they have services and software that they provide that helps us on the servicing side of the business, to manage the relationship between the customer and the servicer through the life of the loan. Those are all services that we do not have today. Black Knight\u2019s other core business is data assets. So they have proprietary data assets and very unique capabilities there that we do not have, that we believe are going to be very beneficial to our clients. Third, they have a complimentary loan origination system, which is one of the things that you just highlighted. But it\u2019s important to point out that the customers that they cater to are fundamentally very different, have a completely different mindset to the customers that we service today at ICE Mortgage Technology. They provide a service that\u2019s an installed service. It's a single instance for a single client, it's very highly customized based on the experience that that lender may want to provide for their clients. Whereas at ICE, ours is a very standardized solution and all you can do is do some basic configuration around the perimeter of it. Our plan is to support and invest in both, to really help drive the efficiencies through the industry by providing that complete front to back service. And the last thing I\u2019d point out is you'll see in the expense synergy numbers that Warren went through. By historical standards for us they are very low, and as Warren pointed out, most of these synergies are in the areas of corporate, real estate, our location strategy as we found, Jacksonville is a low cost place in the U.S. to do business and has a great resource pool. So those are the key areas that you're going to see synergies coming out of the deal and again, a 15% of the combined expense base that\u2019s very low.\nRich Repetto: Great! Thanks for the response Ben and congrats Jeff that you tried to influence another asset class. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Kramm with UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm: Hey, good morning, everyone. I'm just going to ask a bunch of boring financial questions on the deal. One, with interest rates obviously heading higher, would be curious what the interest rate is Warren that you\u2019re assuming in the deal [mass] (ph). Speaking of deal [mass] (ph), curious when you talk about accretion in year one, is that against an earnings expectations that includes buybacks or not. And then lastly you know what's the expected growth rate down the line for the business. When you did the Ellie Mae deal you said the mortgage business for you should be growing in 8 to 10 range. I think Black Knight has grown 8% historically, I think that's in your presentation. So you\u2019re still comfortable that the mortgage segment for you is this 8 to 10 kind of long term grower or should we be thinking about that business differently in the future? Thanks.\nWarren Gardiner: Yeah, thanks Alex. So I'll start with that last question first. So yeah, the short answer is yes. So I think if you think about what Black Knights outlined and this is revealed in \u2013 you know through our due diligence we revealed the same thing. They pointed to a guidance range around 7% to 9% over the long term. Largely recurring revenues too as you\u2019ve heard us note a couple of times already in the prepared remarks. I think the first quarter too by the way is a great example of that, where I noted in my prepared remarks that mortgage volumes were down significantly, including term refi volumes down, which are very sensitive, down about 80%. In that environment they grew their revenues on an organic basis, about 9%. They released their earnings this morning if you want to go check that out. So I think it's a great example of the resilience of that revenue stream against what was a pretty challenging macroeconomic backdrop, so yes. So when you couple that with our 8% to 10% percent as you noted, so that's what we talked about over a longer period of time on average and throw in the revenue synergies that we've outlined, yeah your very much solidly in that high single digit, you know 8% to 10% call it range for the combined business. And so yeah, you've got a very high single digit grower. It's still got a lot of recurring revenue and again, we\u2019re collectively positioned to operate with an expanded addressable market like we \u2013 unlike we are today. So I think very well positioned kind of moving forward you know for that business with a more resilient revenue stream as well, if you will. In terms of your first question, so I\u2019ll hit these ones, these are kind of quick ones. The rates we\u2019re assuming there, so it's a mix of commercial paper and debt. You can think about it on a blended basis kind of being in the 4%, 4.5% kind of percent range in terms of what we assumed for financing, and then on accretion year one, I think you asked if buy backs were included in the base, and so yes, we did include those as part of the base in terms of you know how consensus would be looking at that. Hopefully that helped in answering those questions.\nAlex Kramm: Thank you very much, very helpful.\nOperator: The next question comes from Gautam Sawant from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nGautam Sawant: Good morning! And thank you for taking my question. Can you tell us how both companies are positioned against the rising mortgage rate and higher home price backdrop? I understand that Black Knight has a higher mix of recurring revenues, but can you help us understand how you foresee the backdrop impacting revenues?\nA - Ben Jackson: Yes, thanks for the question. This is Ben. When we think about the deal and we thought about why we should do this deal, you know we had conviction on it, because as I mentioned before, at the end of the day the combination of these two businesses provides an opportunity to create a lot of efficiencies in a market that's very inefficient. One of the marketplaces in the industry that\u2019s the most inefficient, that's the most analog is the mortgage space and we think that this is an opportunity to take two rare sets of assets that are 100% complementary and bring them together. And you know when we see the revenue opportunities here with the business is that again, the businesses are 100% complementary to one another, where we end on the origination side into the electronic closing side. They pick up with a great servicing business. Black Knight has a tremendous set of data and proprietary data assets that we believe we\u2019ll be able to cross sell to our clients and are going to be in high demand with our clients, even in this rising rate environment, and they have that complementary loan origination system that we fully plan to support. The other side of it is that they have a \u2013 they are going to help continue the journey we've been on since we did the deal with ICE Mortgage Technology to move more and more of the revenue towards recurring, and you saw that in our results in the first quarter, where recurring revenue grew 24%, again against that backdrop of a rising rate environment. The mix as Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks of recurring revenue that's counter cyclical in Black Knight is substantially higher than ours, and will move our mortgage business to 70% recurring. In addition, in this rising rate environment we're going to be able to go after the expanded TAM of $10 billion going to $14 billion, and the components of that are adding a servicing TAM of $2 billion and adding an additional $2 billion towards data and analytics, and give us the ability to accelerate going after the existing TAMs that we see. So given the resiliency of that business model that Black Knight has, continuing to shift more of the business towards recurring, you have a millennial generation that's just now coming into their home ownership years, that is a very substantial population in the U.S. that's going to be entering the mortgage buying market and we see all of those as trends that will help support you know the long term goal of 8% to 10% growth for the business.\nA - Jeff Sprecher: There's an incredible demand for homeownership coming from that group that will be unabated and similarly the slide before that, 29, you look at the total U.S. housing stock and you could see the long term trend of continued growth in home ownership, and those massive demographic trends are what give us confidence on moving our business to a more subscription based business that will essentially be attractive to lenders who are trying to play against that trend.\nGautam Sawant: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning! I wanted to follow-up on the revenue mix of Black Knight and thinking about the servicing component, you know what is the growth algorithm of that business? Is it you know kind of just loans outstanding? I understand it\u2019s quite recurring, but curious about pricing power in this business? And then also, when you talked about revenue synergies in the opportunity, I guess give us a \u2013 what do you think are the most logical or easiest kind of points or cross sell opportunities within the two product sets as you combine them?\nWarren Gardiner : Hey Dan! It\u2019s Warren. So I\u2019ll hit you're servicing growth algorithm question first, and then I\u2019m going to hand it over to Joe to talk about some of the revenue synergies. So thinking about the servicing business, yeah it's kind of been a mid-single digit grower. I mean it\u2019s been fluctuating a little bit here and there, it depends, but largely recurring revenue in nature, it\u2019s not entirely recurring revenue nature and based on subscription revenues, but also loans outstanding too as well, which as you see there's a slide in our deck around home stock and then mortgages outstanding. You see there\u2019s pretty consistent growth over the last few years and over the last number of years, you can you can pick your time very frankly, and it consistently grows. And so that's a \u2013 that in addition to the introduction of new products and things of that nature, sort of adding revenue per loan is how you get to a growth algorithm around that range for that business.\nJoe Tyrrell : And this is Joe Tyrrell. I\u2019ll talk a little bit about the revenue synergies and the opportunities that this combination provides to us. So Warren talked about the opportunity to \u2013 through these combined entities to accelerate our penetration of the original $10 billion TAM. That comes to us because of the highly complementary products sets we have available, and actually the opportunity to cross sell products into both bases. So for example, we're able to take ICE Products Solutions, like our consumer engagement suite that has lead management and lead distribution capabilities, as well as our point of sale system. Also our underwriting automation tools that are getting a lot of adoption as Warren mentioned earlier. Even Chase is now deploying our analyzer solutions, I mean to their system, as well as our market leading eRecording capability. So those are all opportunities that we can sell existing ICE Solutions into the Black Knight base. We can also take Black Knight products and sell them into the ICE space. So obviously servicing and I'll talk about the trend that we're seeing with lenders starting to retain more servicing in just a moment, but also the secondary marketing technology, things like hedging and loan trading platform that they provide. We also now will have the opportunity to recognize. I think of this as more of an MSRP versus some of the transactional fees that we've been able to generate on our network. Black Knight products are actually available today on our network. One of the things that our network does at ICE is it really enabled access to choice for lenders, and so we've had a long standing relationship with many Black Knight Solutions being available. We\u2019ll now have the opportunity to realize kind of the list price for those fees instead of just the transactional components that we've had. And then \u2013 so that\u2019s true for things like tax service, property valuations and obviously Optimal Blue's been on platform for many, many years. We also now have the opportunity to really expand how we've been thinking about data. Historically our data TAM has really been focused on selling data within the mortgage industry. Now as we look at these highly complementary datasets, it gives us the opportunity to think about licensing this data. So we just recently released our first kind of true data product using the mortgage data that had come from Ellie Mae through our Rate Lock Indices and we've announced that we intend to put a Futures contract against that. As we're able to compliment all of that origination data, with the secondary marketing data that we get from Black Knight, coupled with the servicing and loan performance data, we now have a really unique data set that as Jeff mentioned is going to provide a completely different level of transparency and visibility into how the secondary market thinks about pricing our mortgage backed securities and certainly modeling out prepayment. This also provides us the opportunity to enter new TAMs. So obviously servicing as Ben talked about is a $2 billion TAM that we now have access to, that previously we\u2019ve had no offerings and didn't include in our current TAM. What we're seeing there in the servicing side is more lenders as Jeff mentioned are retaining the servicing rights. But what they've really lacked is the ability to connect everything from the point of thought of engaging a consumer, through the loan manufacturing process, into servicing and keeping that as almost a closed loop ecosystem where they are constantly monitoring loans to identify opportunities to help consumers improve cash flow, by getting out of some of those risk adjustment that were put in place at the time of origination by monitoring things like home value appreciation or changes in the economic situation of those consumers, where now those lenders can proactively go out and help them improve their cash flow which ultimately lowers default rates for consumers, but enables those lenders to recapture that, that consumer without incurring that acquisition cost. Also, it gives us the opportunity to enter into a realtor TAM and that data is really interesting too us, especially on the multiple listing service side. And so think about the opportunities of now combining data from consumer behavior to home listings, all the way through the loan performance. In the data TAM we see that as that unique opportunity from a licensing perspective, which we believe increases our previous data TAM by another $2 billion. And then lastly, I would just say that this really helps us to accelerate our shift that we've already been engaging on, to more of a recurring revenue, a focus versus the transactional. As interest rates rise, what happens in the servicing business is those loans stick in the servicing longer. So you have a more consistent recurring revenue base in servicing whenever interest rates increase. Now as interest rates decrease, we\u2019ll be able to capitalize on the monetization opportunities in the origination side. So it really gives us now this end-to-end, somewhat counter cyclical recurring revenue stream.\nDan Fannon: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hey! Good morning! And thanks for taking the question, and we're restricted on the deal, so I\u2019ll pivot to maybe European energy. So I want to hear your thoughts about the impact that the Ukraine crisis could have on your energy business in Europe, and maybe the ICE Exchange business more broadly. Really trying to focus on the longer term since the sourcing of European gas and oil maybe changing meaningfully for the longer term. So if you could start out, maybe what do the changes in the sourcing of European oil mean for Brent? Is that largely a zero-sum game or is it as positive as Europe moves off Russian oil. Two, same question on European gas. As we see more North African gas and maybe LNG from the U.S. and Qatar, again a zero-sum game or more positive? And then lastly, the ancillary impacts on the non-European energy businesses. It seems like there could be a positive impact here on carbon freight Sonya Houston, U.S. Gas. So any thoughts on you know collectively the non-European energy impact as well.\nJeff Sprecher: Yeah, those are a good set of questions. So well let me, you know we had a great quarter amongst all that uncertainty that existed in the energy markets and if you peel back what happened in the quarter, it actually answers a number of the questions that you postulated. First of all, we see record open interest in our energy space. So there's more engagement if you will, of managing risk in the energy space. But when you peel back, well where did that open interest come from, there's definitely some trends that are engaging on where your question is heading. First of all, we saw that a lot of price volatility obviously in Europe, that happened quickly due to war, and whenever there's high price volatility, that is an input into the margin model, since your essentially marketing for the largest one day price movement. And so margin rates go up. And so what we saw was a movement towards the use of options, away from the underlying towards the option against the underlying. Why does that happen? Well it's a little less expensive to control the risk in an option. It's also much less precise; you're hedging a range of outcomes instead of a specific outcome. So people have moved and it's probably somewhat temporary, because high prices themselves don't cause high margins, it's the price movements and the market is increasingly as you're alluding to, trying to figure out the long term ecosystem for energy in Europe and as they do that, the prices will stabilize, albeit at most likely at higher rates. Another thing that has happened is that in a number of our products, particularly in Europe, but even Brent Oil globally, people can deliver Russian energy into those indices or into those products that are physically delivered, and while many of those Russian products are not subject to sanctions, and in fact certain countries in Europe are even advocating the use of those products, the market itself due to moral and ethical issues, many companies have decided not to participate in those. So we are launching a whole new suite of products that are Ex-Russia Energy and there's been a lot of demand for those products and we've got regulatory approval and you're going to be seeing those rolling out. We have very high expectations for those products given the chat that's going on and the way we\u2019ve worked with the industry to develop those Ex-Russia Energy projects. Then, the last thing that you polluted to is that you're seeing an increase volume in the trading up U.S. Natural Gas. Again, we see Europeans who are sensitive to hedging using European Natural Gas, because it may have Russian molecules in it, hedging their exposure somewhat in the United States. Obviously there's liquefied natural gas exports out of the U.S., those are relatively limited, but where there is capability, people are leaning into those capabilities and you've seen this increase in U.S. Natural Gas trading. So all of that amalgamation somewhat bodes well for our business and that we\u2019ve you know, in a world where markets are in contango, high open interest foreshadows future volume and revenue growth for us in trading and we've got this new suite of products that the market is anxious to adopt, and it\u2019s going to give us even more diversity and basis trading against our historical business. So we feel very good about the direction that the company is heading in, even though we're helping people to manage risk in a very unfortunate situation.\nKen Worthington: Okay, great. Thank you so much for that.\nOperator: The next question comes from Chris Allen with Compass Point. Please go ahead.\nChris Allen : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on some prior questions, and maybe some different angles. Just from a customer based perspective, what is \u2013 does BK, does Black Knight add any \u2013 present new opportunities to penetrate different customer bases? I believe they've had some recent success penetrating some of the non-bank originators who used homegrown solutions. And also when you put the whole franchise together, who is going to be the main competition from a longer term perspective?\nJoe Tyrrell : Chris, so this is Joe. I'll give you the answers there. When we think about the customer bases, again if you go back to Ben\u2019s comment regarding explaining the differences between Encompass and Empower, these two solutions really now give us the opportunity to address any technology philosophy that a lender might have. So if someone wants really a single tenancy highly customized solution, we will have an offering there. If they want a more kind of commercial, highly configurable, but multi-tenant solution, we\u2019ll have an offering there. So because these products are so complementary, we believe it gives us an opportunity to really accelerate that penetration of the current TAM. There obviously are some customers that we have in common, because within ICE there is so many different products that we offer, but what we really see is the cross sell opportunity into these two bases. So even where we might have a similar customer, perhaps it's a customer that\u2019s using Encompass and also sing MSP, the servicing platform, there is still so many other solutions we now have available jointly that we can cross sell to that individual lender. If you go back and look at slide nine, this is a high level view of kind of solution sets, but within these sets there's multiple products, and so there's so many different ways to monetize a single loan that goes through this entire work-flow, and we're really excited about the opportunities we have of looking at our combined solution sets, and being able to now make sure that we can provide efficiency that literally every step of this manufacturing and servicing workflow. And then you know lastly the data is a huge opportunity for us. Very complementary datasets between what we have on the front end and what Black Knight offers on the backend, and for us we think it's really just kind of tip of the spear when we think about how we can monetize that data.\nChris Allen : Thanks. Any color on the competition?\nJoe Tyrrell : Yeah, on the competition, it really has not changed. This transaction doesn't change that. Our competition continues to be proprietary systems, legacy technologies that many lenders have had for a number of years. I think we\u2019ve \u2013 Ben's probably mention on previous calls that we\u2019ve really started to see that get unblocked. That is a lot of those lenders are realizing. As you go back to what Jeff pointed out on slide 34, whether a lender does one loan or a thousand loans, they have to navigate all of this highly regulatory compliance requirements. And so these lenders have realize that they've spent a significant amount of development dollars just maintaining legacy systems to remain compliant, instead of really focusing on innovation. So we're engaged in a lot of great conversations with many of those lenders who've been using proprietary technology. This combination and these two offerings that we now have, give us the opportunity to really be able to offer a solution for whatever technology philosophy those lenders have, coming off of the proprietary technology. So that continues to be the area where we\u2019ll be chopping wood.\nChris Allen : Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi! Good morning! I just want to follow-up on the potential combination of Encompass and Empower. From your prior comments, it didn't sound like you expect those two businesses to really be fully integrated, and expect to continue to invest in those separately. So just to clarify, are any of the total synergies you outlined on the revenue or the cost side attributable to the combination of those two LOS platforms? And I understand a lot of strategic rationale for the deal is really about pairing the origination servicing businesses, as well as expanding that data TAM. Is it fair to say that this deal is very strategically attractive to ICE, even without considering a combination of those LOS platforms?\nBen Jackson : Hi Kyle! It\u2019s Ben. So we 100% see those platforms as complementary and they service a completely different client with a completely different type of mindset, and there is no part of our synergy case that assumes that both platforms would be combined, one would get sunsets. In fact it's the opposite. We have put into our model significant investment into, that we know is going to be needed to help modernize certain parts of the technology, both on MSP as well as in Empower, and we know that clients that have made decisions to go on to Empower you know for very specific reasons, for their strategy have decided to have a single instance on-prem, highly customized version of the application. So that, there's again 0% of \u2013 zero part of our business case here is around sun setting one of the technologies or about investment in the two. And as Joe articulated, it's about cross selling all of the other suites of services that we have, whether you've chosen Empower or Encompass, cross selling all those other services to be able to create that straight through, customer for life experience. From the point in time when they are searching for a home online, to when they are selecting the right product that will meet their family's needs, to automating the origination process, and the manufacturing process of the loans, to an electronic closing, to then the servicing relationship for the life of the loan, and identifying optimal products for that client as their life situation changes. So that's what this transaction is all about, and we look forward to the benefits that we can provide to the end consumer services and originators.\nJeff Sprecher: And as you think about what Joe and Ben have talked about of these cross sell opportunities that continues to play into our thesis, that this can be done through recurring licenses. The more you have an end-to-end solution and customers are not having to go buy everything \u00c0 la carte, it allows us to package a really interesting suite of products under licensing arrangements that we think ultimately will be rewarded by the market.\nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell : Great! Thanks, good morning! thank for taking my question. Another one on Black Knight of course. Maybe just looking at the TAM, the $14 billion TAM, combined revenue looks like it's, you know it will begin to approach $3 billion out of that $14 billion TAM. So just really only a 20% share I guess. First is that, you view that as a justification for this not being an anti-trust issue given that you're still a minority of the overall TAM. And as you over time penetrate that with a better solution, even if you're the dominant outsourcer, I guess to what extent do you see that market share improvement being incremental to the revenue synergies that you\u2019ve outlined in the 125, and I guess one other question would be, just investment in sales and any other CapEx investments that would be required to change the BKI Technology stack as you mentioned.\nBen Jackson : Hi Brian! It's Ben. I\u2019ll take a stab at this. So, when \u2013 and while I was articulating before in terms of the review we did, our lawyers and Black Knight's lawyers have done, you literally quickly come to the conclusion that there's, these businesses are 100% complementary, we don't compete with one another. And that what\u2019s the driver for this deal is that is its really taking for the this first time services across the data space, services in the origination space, in the consumer engagement space, the closing space and then the servicing space, bringing them together to give that complete front to back solution. So and as you peal through it, and as we engage with the regulators, we're very confident they are going to come to the conclusion, but there is a ton of benefits that can come from this, and that also the businesses just flat out don't compete with one another. On the revenue side of it, what we see is that the pie is expanding. Because here the industry is so inefficient, it is the most analog space in asset class that we've seen, as we've been on our journey of taking businesses from analog to digital, that what's really driving this and when you think about that TAM, we are not taking market share from other people, we are taking market share from just complete inefficiency, manual processing and costs that are rising on the end consumer, costs that are rising for servicers and originators and the plan is to bring that all down. So that's you know overall the first part of your question. I know you got a question on CapEx I think as well, and I\u2019ll ask Warren to take that one.\nWarren Gardiner : Yeah, well in terms of CapEx, I think it was more on the technology side. I missed kind of the end there, but around some of the technology spend. So the CapEx for Black Knight\u2019s been around $100 million annually. I don\u2019t think you should be thinking about it a whole lot different in terms of a run rate for that. There is, because Ben mentioned some incremental spend that we built into the model, both OpEx and CapEx around some of the technology re-platforming that we plan to do over a number of years. We\u2019ve done this plenty of times in the past, whether it's with IDC or New York Stock Exchanges, and so we've got some a pretty good sense about timing and an amount there. And that\u2019s something that we plan to do over the next number of years. So it's really spread out over sort of a three to five to seven if not quite more in the year period.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprecher: Thank you, Betsy, and thank you all for joining us this morning. And I'd like to thank my colleagues for delivering the best quarter in our company's history and I thank our customers for their business in this quarter. And we look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to try to build out very innovative solutions to further advance markets, and deliver compounding growth to our shareholders. Have a great day!\nOperator: The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ben Jackson",
            "content": "Hey Rich! Good question and you know obviously it's a large deal, so we expect it to take time for regulators to understand the complementary nature of our two businesses. But at the end of the day we're confident that they'll come into the same conclusion that we did, and also we had and as well as Black Knight had legal counsel look at this in detail, and came to the conclusion that these are 100% complementary businesses that service different parts of the mortgage ecosystem. And at the end of the day, and you heard it through the prepared comments through Jeff's comments today, that bringing these businesses together is the best way to further advance innovation in the mortgage industry and bring efficiencies that are desperately needed to the servicers, to originators and then through to the end customer. And when I say that the businesses are complementary and Jeff referred to slide nine in the deck when he was going through it, which I think is a great picture of it. You can see that with Black Knight's businesses, they start really in the front end on the real estate side where we do not have assets, and then they pick up again post the closing process where they have services and software that they provide that helps us on the servicing side of the business, to manage the relationship between the customer and the servicer through the life of the loan. Those are all services that we do not have today. Black Knight's other core business is data assets. So they have proprietary data assets and very unique capabilities there that we do not have, that we believe are going to be very beneficial to our clients. Third, they have a complimentary loan origination system, which is one of the things that you just highlighted. But it's important to point out that the customers that they cater to are fundamentally very different, have a completely different mindset to the customers that we service today at ICE Mortgage Technology. They provide a service that's an installed service. It's a single instance for a single client, it's very highly customized based on the experience that that lender may want to provide for their clients. Whereas at ICE, ours is a very standardized solution and all you can do is do some basic configuration around the perimeter of it. Our plan is to support and invest in both, to really help drive the efficiencies through the industry by providing that complete front to back service. And the last thing I'd point out is you'll see in the expense synergy numbers that Warren went through. By historical standards for us they are very low, and as Warren pointed out, most of these synergies are in the areas of corporate, real estate, our location strategy as we found, Jacksonville is a low cost place in the U.S. to do business and has a great resource pool. So those are the key areas that you're going to see synergies coming out of the deal and again, a 15% of the combined expense base that's very low. Hi Kyle! It's Ben. So we 100% see those platforms as complementary and they service a completely different client with a completely different type of mindset, and there is no part of our synergy case that assumes that both platforms would be combined, one would get sunsets. In fact it's the opposite. We have put into our model significant investment into, that we know is going to be needed to help modernize certain parts of the technology, both on MSP as well as in Empower, and we know that clients that have made decisions to go on to Empower you know for very specific reasons, for their strategy have decided to have a single instance on-prem, highly customized version of the application.

            "name": "Jeff Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we're here to discuss the financial results of the best quarter in ICE's history, along with our plan to continue our track record of growth with our agreement to acquire the public company Black Knight. Black Knight is an important piece of financial market infrastructure that we believe will allow us to continue to reduce the cost of home borrowing, when coupled to the other U.S. mortgage industry assets that we built and acquired. This proposed acquisition is another step in a journey that ICE has embarked on since its founding. As an early entrepreneur, I studied the exchange space and I discovered that the largest exchanges all had one asset class in common, interest rates. And what became abundantly clear during the financial crisis was that hedgers who thought they had affectively managed risk using legacy interest rate products were doing so very imperfectly. Couple that with the analog to digital conversion that's been happening to markets more broadly, and we saw a powerful opportunity to redefine our exchange business, and we've been diligently working on this thesis for more than 15 years. To compete with hedging products in the corporate borrowing area, we acquired Creditex in 2008, married it with a Board of Trade Clearing Corporation in 2009 and launched a clear credit default swap market that this quarter generated $72 million of revenue and grew 33% year-over-year. We acquired the Life Exchange in 2013 and revenue from its interest rate products grew 36% in the quarter. We acquired Interactive Data Corporation in 2015, and married it to the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch Credit and Bond Index business in 2017, to build tools and launch a powerful suite of corporate borrowing indices and reference data. We doubled the revenue growth in those businesses to an average annual rate of 6%. In the consumer lending area, because the largest amounts of consumer borrowing are tied to home mortgages, we pursued opportunities in the U.S. mortgage space, acquiring the Mortgage Electronic Registry Service in 2018, Simplifile in 2019 and Ellie Mae in 2020. When coupled together, these technologies can offer lenders the potential to shorten the time that it holds interest rate risk, market exposure, from the time of the consumer rate lock until the time of wholesale funding, fundamentally changing the risk profile for lenders. And by leveraging our data expertise across the company, we recently created the ICE Rate Lock Index and have announced that we're launching a Futures contract on it in the coming weeks, creating an even more precise interest rate risk management tool. Now, by adding Black Knight to our solutions set, we have the potential to further improve the capital market ecosystem that surrounds the funding of U.S. Home Mortgages. De-risking these markets for participants by shortening the duration when interest rate risks are held, making data more transparent to the risk holders and creating more efficient hedging markets for those involved should ultimately lower the cost for the entire market. There's no question that our thesis of producing better interest rate products and tools has been proven out, as we have transformed the way risk is managed in the markets we serve, and our thesis continues to compound on growth as we innovate new interest rate hedging tools. So let me now ask you to turn to slide six of the ICE and Black Knight transaction deck. Yesterday afternoon we announced that ICE has entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Black Knight for $85 per share or a market value of $13 billion. Consideration is expected to be in the form of a mix of 80% cash and 20% stock and the transaction is expected to be accretive to adjusted earnings per share in the first full year following its completion. Warren will discuss the financials in more detail, but first I'll discuss the strategic rationale of this very exciting transaction. Black Knight is a premier provider of Integrated, Mission Critical, Software Solutions and Data and Analytics that serve the U.S. Mortgage and Real Estate Markets. Black Knight suite of solutions span across the mortgage work-flow and are highly complementary to ICE's existing businesses. By expanding our solution set beyond originations, we will be able to deliver a life of loan platform that reduces friction and drives transparency across the workflow. The integration of our solutions will strengthen the overall mortgage ecosystem, bringing more choice and delivering efficiencies for lenders, servicers, partners and ultimately the end consumer. This combination will also expand the addressable market in our mortgage business to $14 billion, and better positions us to penetrate our existing $10 billion TAM. Black Knight will complement our all-weather business model, with a high growth and highly recurring revenue base. And finally, we will leverage ICE's technology expertise to modernize Black Knight's technology stack, while tightly integrating our offerings to enable the many opportunities that are in front of us. Turning to slide seven. Much like the history and culture at ICE, Black Knight's mission focuses on customer service and product excellence. The expansive product suite and compelling value proposition Black Knight brings to its customer base has enabled consistent revenue and EBITDA growth, a trend that we believe will only continue as a part of ICE. Moving now to slide eight, you'll find a summary overview of our strategic rationale, which I'll discuss in more detail with the subsequent slides, beginning now on slide nine. The opportunity we see in the mortgage space is much like the opportunities that we're executing against other interest rate markets and asset classes, by integrating data and technology across the entire work flow, to bring greater transparency and efficiencies to the broader ecosystem. The very manual loan origination process and its extensive regulatory oversight has driven the cost to originate a U.S. home mortgage in nearly $9,000, with approximately one quarter of that amount being related to customer acquisition costs. As a result, more lenders are beginning to retain the servicing rights of the mortgages that they originate to recapture previous customers and reduce their acquisition costs. By connecting Black Knight servicing system to the underwriting automation and consumer engagement solutions at ICE, we have an opportunity to create a life of loan platform that will enable lenders to realize a customer for life. This connection will lower the acquisition costs for lenders, enabling those savings to be passed on to the consumer. Turning now to slide 10. Data is a core competency at ICE, from our earliest days we recognize the value of leveraging data to drive transparency, and we continue to build on that expertise by broadening our datasets, connecting data across asset classes and innovating for our customers. The data sets that exists across the complementary businesses of ICE and Black Knight present an untapped opportunity to apply that same playbook within home mortgage. With access to solutions such as Black Knight's MLS listing services and real-estate data, we'll have a presence in the home search process. In addition, there's an opportunity to leverage Black Knight's tax data and property valuation analytics to further enhance the underwriting process and provide our customers additional insights into rapidly changing market dynamics. We'll also have the opportunity to expand our existing ICE Mortgage Technology Solutions set into secondary markets, increasing the transparency for servicers and investors, by enabling them to better understand their portfolio valuations, performance and risk. And by combining this rich data with ICE's expertise in fixed income and capital markets, we'll be able to provide even greater transparency to the fixed income markets through transaction based data for more accurate pricing and prepayment modeling. Turning now to slide 11. As we've demonstrated in our other asset classes, the integration of data and technology across the mortgage workflow should enable greater automation and in turn reduce friction to help lower the cost to originate our home mortgage for all parties, ultimately making our loan more affordable and accessible for the American home buyer. By adding content to our Consumer Engagement Solutions, we plan to provide consumers and investor's greater clarity and insight into unique loan products, and the key metrics that impact homeownership such as interest rate levels in lending policies, ultimately improving the overall home buying experience for the consumer. Lenders will also be able to proactively underwrite current customers for future home lending opportunities, by helping consumers lower their housing payments by refinancing out of additional interest rate overlays or reducing their risk adjustments to the original mortgage. And leveraging common datasets across the entire mortgage cycle could reduce data entry errors and erroneous fees that today impact consumers directly. We also see an opportunity to develop innovative analytics, helping lenders connect with potential buyers in historically underserved markets, and identify minority bias in the home valuation process. These are just a few of the many examples, of the many opportunities that we see to leverage our data and technology to support potential homeowners, and make the dream of home ownership a reality. Moving to slide 12, the work flow efficiencies, this combination will deliver underpin and expanded addressable market of $14 billion, including $2 billion from servicing solutions and an additional $2 billion within data and analytics. Our combined businesses will bolster our point of sale and Consumer Engagement Solutions, enabling us to better serve that portion of our existing TAM. In order to provide you with additional transparency into this opportunity, we've separated this $2 billion addressable market from the application processing and underwriting segment, which here is largely made up of our Loan Origination Technology. Black Knight also brings capabilities that will allow us to access part of our existing TAM that we don't have a solution for today such as their hedging and trading platform. These capabilities combined with our deep expertise in trading and clearing unlock our longer term opportunity to improve transparency for the secondary market participants in the form of a loan exchange. And finally, we'll be better positioned to monetize our current $10 billion TAM to opportunities to promote existing products across an expanded customer base. Moving to Slide 13. Black Knight's highly recurring, more predictable revenues will complement ICE's existing revenue streams and increase our mix of high growth recurring revenues. Within ICE Mortgage Technology, our mix of recurring revenues will increase from roughly 50% to approximately 70% and total ICE revenues will now be over 50% recurring on a pro forma basis. Importantly, these high growth recurring revenues are underpinned by mission critical data, and technology that's embedded in our customers workflows, and by adding more stable revenue streams to our current mortgage technology revenues, we will improve the visibility and durability of our earnings and cash flow, further complementaring our all-weather business model. Let me now turn the call back over to Warren, and he'll discuss the financial details of today's transaction. Thank you, Warren. I'll conclude my remarks on slide 16. Since our founding, ICE has operated with a strategy to build tools and markets for institutions and consumers, which operate in the white space of the inefficiencies of legacy markets, and we seek to do this smartly, in a manner that enables us to grow our earnings in all economic and interest rate conditions, so that ICE is truly an all-weather growth story, something that does not exist in a single market or asset class alone. This vision is one that we continue to organically build out ourselves, but one only has to look at our acquisition history, including my original acquisition of the founding company to ICE, to see that its valuable assets become available to us at prices that meet our disciplined M&A criteria, than will accelerate our build out plans by our acquisition. And through thoughtful integration, leveraging the infrastructure and expertise of the acquired company, we advance our vision and accelerate our goals to fundamentally transform the markets in which we operate. Our proposed acquisition of Black Knight is another important piece of this vision. I'll now turn the call back to our moderator Betsy, and we'll conduct the question-and-answer session. Yeah, those are a good set of questions. So well let me, you know we had a great quarter amongst all that uncertainty that existed in the energy markets and if you peel back what happened in the quarter, it actually answers a number of the questions that you postulated. First of all, we see record open interest in our energy space. So there's more engagement if you will, of managing risk in the energy space. But when you peel back, well where did that open interest come from, there's definitely some trends that are engaging on where your question is heading. First of all, we saw that a lot of price volatility obviously in Europe, that happened quickly due to war, and whenever there's high price volatility, that is an input into the margin model, since your essentially marketing for the largest one day price movement. And so margin rates go up. And so what we saw was a movement towards the use of options, away from the underlying towards the option against the underlying. Why does that happen? Well it's a little less expensive to control the risk in an option. It's also much less precise; you're hedging a range of outcomes instead of a specific outcome. So people have moved and it's probably somewhat temporary, because high prices themselves don't cause high margins, it's the price movements and the market is increasingly as you're alluding to, trying to figure out the long term ecosystem for energy in Europe and as they do that, the prices will stabilize, albeit at most likely at higher rates. Another thing that has happened is that in a number of our products, particularly in Europe, but even Brent Oil globally, people can deliver Russian energy into those indices or into those products that are physically delivered, and while many of those Russian products are not subject to sanctions, and in fact certain countries in Europe are even advocating the use of those products, the market itself due to moral and ethical issues, many companies have decided not to participate in those. So we are launching a whole new suite of products that are Ex-Russia Energy and there's been a lot of demand for those products and we've got regulatory approval and you're going to be seeing those rolling out. We have very high expectations for those products given the chat that's going on and the way we've worked with the industry to develop those Ex-Russia Energy projects. Then, the last thing that you polluted to is that you're seeing an increase volume in the trading up U.S. Natural Gas. Again, we see Europeans who are sensitive to hedging using European Natural Gas, because it may have Russian molecules in it, hedging their exposure somewhat in the United States. Obviously there's liquefied natural gas exports out of the U.S., those are relatively limited, but where there is capability, people are leaning into those capabilities and you've seen this increase in U.S. Natural Gas trading. So all of that amalgamation somewhat bodes well for our business and that we've you know, in a world where markets are in contango, high open interest foreshadows future volume and revenue growth for us in trading and we've got this new suite of products that the market is anxious to adopt, and it's going to give us even more diversity and basis trading against our historical business. So we feel very good about the direction that the company is heading in, even though we're helping people to manage risk in a very unfortunate situation. And as you think about what Joe and Ben have talked about of these cross sell opportunities that continues to play into our thesis, that this can be done through recurring licenses. The more you have an end-to-end solution and customers are not having to go buy everything A\u0300 la carte, it allows us to package a really interesting suite of products under licensing arrangements that we think ultimately will be rewarded by the market. Thank you, Betsy, and thank you all for joining us this morning. And I'd like to thank my colleagues for delivering the best quarter in our company's history and I thank our customers for their business in this quarter. And we look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to try to build out very innovative solutions to further advance markets, and deliver compounding growth to our shareholders. Have a great day!"

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks MC. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on slide four of the earnings supplement with some quick highlights from our first quarter results and I'll turn it over to Jeff to discuss the exciting transaction we announced yesterday afternoon. First quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.43, up 7% year-over-year, marking the best quarter in our company's history. Net revenues totaled a record $1.9 billion, an increase of 6% versus last year. Total transaction revenues grew 4%, while total recurring revenues which accounted for nearly half of our business increased by 9%. Importantly, this is on top of 10% growth in the first quarter of 2021. First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $746 million in the middle of our guidance range. Had it not been for a few million dollars of severance, adjusted operating expenses would have been towards the lower end of the range. Looking to the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $740 million to $750 million. First quarter adjusted operating income increased by 9% to a record $1.2 billion. While free cash flow totaled $660 million, which we largely deployed in the form of share repurchases of $475 million. Now let's move to slide five, where I'll provide a quick overview of the performance of each of our segments. First quarter exchange net revenues totaled $1.1 billion, an increase of 12% year-over-year. This strong performance was driven by a 36% increase in our interest rate futures and a 16% increase in our energy revenues. Revenues within our global natural gas and environmental products which represent approximately 40% of energy revenues increased by 30% in the quarter. Recurring revenues which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business increased by 7% year-over-year, including 13% growth in listings. Turning now to slide six, in our fixed income and data services segment first quarter revenues totaled a record $509 million, a 9% increase versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 28%, including 9% revenue growth in ICE bonds and 33% growth in our CDS business, driven by rising interest rates and macro-economic uncertainty. Recurring revenue growth which accounted for nearly 85% of segment revenues grew by 6% in the quarter, once again driven by double digit growth in our index and consolidated feeds businesses, and strong performance from our ICE Global Network and other data services businesses. And importantly, annual subscription value or ASV enters the second quarter up over 6% year-over-year. Shifting to Mortgage Technology on slide seven, first quarter revenues totaled $307 million, while total mortgage technology revenues declined year-over-year in the first quarter. We once again outperformed an industry that experienced a 40% decline in origination volumes, including an 80% decline in term refi volume. Recurring revenues which accounted for over half of segment revenues, totaled $156 million and grew 24% year-over-year. As the mortgage origination backdrop continues to normalize, customers are in search of both automation and greater efficiency, a trend that contribute to one of the strongest sales quarters for our data and analytics product suite, including the implementation of our analyzers by J.P. Morgan Chase. In addition, based on the strong performance through the first quarter of 2022 and the visibility we have into the current sales pipeline, we believe our current revenue growth in our mortgage business is trending towards the high end of our low to mid-teens guidance range. In summary, while a rapid rise in interest rates may have weighed on mortgage transaction volumes during the quarter, that same macroeconomic factor also provided a tailwind to our interest rate, commodity and fixed income businesses. And once again alongside strong growth across our recurring revenue base, helps us deliver another record quarter for revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share, a testament to the all-weather nature of our business model. With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff. Thanks Jeff. Please turn to slide 14. As Jeff noted, yesterday we announced we have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Black Knight for $85 per share or market value of $13 billion. The share prices in line with Black Knight's 52 week high just achieved on December 30, 2021 represents a fully synergized EV to EBITDA multiple of approximately 15x forward. We anticipate the transaction will be accretive to ICE's adjusted earnings per share in the first year post close, with adjusted earnings accretion accelerating thereafter. Embedded within our purchase value are cost synergies of approximately $200 million, with one-third realized in year one, two-thirds by year three and 100% by year five. These cost synergies are expected to be driven by the integration of corporate functions, real-estate optimization and a more efficient use of shared services across the combined platform. When combined with the remaining Ellie Mae synergies, total expected cost synergies represent approximately 15% of the pro forma IMT Black Knight expense base. Shifting to revenues, we've underwritten approximately $125 million of net revenue synergies by year five, representing roughly 1% of our expanded $14 billion addressable market. These synergies will largely be driven by cross sell of existing products across our expanded customer base. Transaction consideration will come in the form of 80% cash and 20% stock. The plan to finance the cash component through a combination of commercial paper, newly issued debt and cash on hand at the time of close, which we currently anticipate will be in the first half of 2023. Gross leverage at close is expected to temporarily peak at approximately 4.1x pro forma EBITDA, which is below the 4.25 peak leverage we reached with Ellie Mae. We believe this financing structure demonstrates our commitment to maintaining a solid investment grade rating, and as of this week we've elected to spend share purchases until our leverage falls below 3.25x, which we anticipate will be towards the end of 2024. You will note on appendix slide 24, our strong track record of deleveraging post acquisition. As with Ellie Mae, we are targeting normalized leverage levels in the 2.75 to 3 range. We believe our enhanced cash flow generation will allow us to achieve this deleveraging path, even as we continue to invest in our business and our people, while also continuing to grow our dividend. Moving to slide 15. Based on first quarter results and pro forma for Black Knight, we expect that our mortgage segment will represent approximately 30% of total Ice revenues compared to 16% previously. Recurring revenues within our mortgage segment are expected to account for nearly 40% of total ICE recurring revenues, where our mortgage transaction revenues will represent only 10% of total ICE revenues. In addition, on close we anticipate providing additional metrics to help investors better understand the progress we are making as a combined platform, and the secular growth opportunities that underpin the analog to digital conversion occurring within the mortgage space. With that, I'm happy to take your questions in Q&A. But I'll first turn the call back over to Jeff for some closing comments. Yeah, thanks Alex. So I'll start with that last question first. So yeah, the short answer is yes. So I think if you think about what Black Knights outlined and this is revealed in \u2013 you know through our due diligence we revealed the same thing. They pointed to a guidance range around 7% to 9% over the long term. Largely recurring revenues too as you've heard us note a couple of times already in the prepared remarks. I think the first quarter too by the way is a great example of that, where I noted in my prepared remarks that mortgage volumes were down significantly, including term refi volumes down, which are very sensitive, down about 80%. In that environment they grew their revenues on an organic basis, about 9%. They released their earnings this morning if you want to go check that out. So I think it's a great example of the resilience of that revenue stream against what was a pretty challenging macroeconomic backdrop, so yes. So when you couple that with our 8% to 10% percent as you noted, so that's what we talked about over a longer period of time on average and throw in the revenue synergies that we've outlined, yeah your very much solidly in that high single digit, you know 8% to 10% call it range for the combined business. And so yeah, you've got a very high single digit grower. It's still got a lot of recurring revenue and again, we're collectively positioned to operate with an expanded addressable market like we \u2013 unlike we are today. So I think very well positioned kind of moving forward you know for that business with a more resilient revenue stream as well, if you will. In terms of your first question, so I'll hit these ones, these are kind of quick ones. The rates we're assuming there, so it's a mix of commercial paper and debt. You can think about it on a blended basis kind of being in the 4%, 4.5% kind of percent range in terms of what we assumed for financing, and then on accretion year one, I think you asked if buy backs were included in the base, and so yes, we did include those as part of the base in terms of you know how consensus would be looking at that. Hopefully that helped in answering those questions. Hey Dan! It's Warren. So I'll hit you're servicing growth algorithm question first, and then I'm going to hand it over to Joe to talk about some of the revenue synergies. So thinking about the servicing business, yeah it's kind of been a mid-single digit grower. I mean it's been fluctuating a little bit here and there, it depends, but largely recurring revenue in nature, it's not entirely recurring revenue nature and based on subscription revenues, but also loans outstanding too as well, which as you see there's a slide in our deck around home stock and then mortgages outstanding. You see there's pretty consistent growth over the last few years and over the last number of years, you can you can pick your time very frankly, and it consistently grows. And so that's a \u2013 that in addition to the introduction of new products and things of that nature, sort of adding revenue per loan is how you get to a growth algorithm around that range for that business. Yeah, well in terms of CapEx, I think it was more on the technology side. I missed kind of the end there, but around some of the technology spend. So the CapEx for Black Knight's been around $100 million annually. I don't think you should be thinking about it a whole lot different in terms of a run rate for that. There is, because Ben mentioned some incremental spend that we built into the model, both OpEx and CapEx around some of the technology re-platforming that we plan to do over a number of years. We've done this plenty of times in the past, whether it's with IDC or New York Stock Exchanges, and so we've got some a pretty good sense about timing and an amount there. And that's something that we plan to do over the next number of years. So it's really spread out over sort of a three to five to seven if not quite more in the year period."

            "name": "A - Ben Jackson",
            "content": "Yes, thanks for the question. This is Ben. When we think about the deal and we thought about why we should do this deal, you know we had conviction on it, because as I mentioned before, at the end of the day the combination of these two businesses provides an opportunity to create a lot of efficiencies in a market that's very inefficient. One of the marketplaces in the industry that's the most inefficient, that's the most analog is the mortgage space and we think that this is an opportunity to take two rare sets of assets that are 100% complementary and bring them together. And you know when we see the revenue opportunities here with the business is that again, the businesses are 100% complementary to one another, where we end on the origination side into the electronic closing side. They pick up with a great servicing business. Black Knight has a tremendous set of data and proprietary data assets that we believe we'll be able to cross sell to our clients and are going to be in high demand with our clients, even in this rising rate environment, and they have that complementary loan origination system that we fully plan to support. The other side of it is that they have a \u2013 they are going to help continue the journey we've been on since we did the deal with ICE Mortgage Technology to move more and more of the revenue towards recurring, and you saw that in our results in the first quarter, where recurring revenue grew 24%, again against that backdrop of a rising rate environment. The mix as Jeff mentioned in his prepared remarks of recurring revenue that's counter cyclical in Black Knight is substantially higher than ours, and will move our mortgage business to 70% recurring. In addition, in this rising rate environment we're going to be able to go after the expanded TAM of $10 billion going to $14 billion, and the components of that are adding a servicing TAM of $2 billion and adding an additional $2 billion towards data and analytics, and give us the ability to accelerate going after the existing TAMs that we see. So given the resiliency of that business model that Black Knight has, continuing to shift more of the business towards recurring, you have a millennial generation that's just now coming into their home ownership years, that is a very substantial population in the U.S. that's going to be entering the mortgage buying market and we see all of those as trends that will help support you know the long term goal of 8% to 10% growth for the business."

There's an incredible demand for homeownership coming from that group that will be unabated and similarly the slide before that, 29, you look at the total U.S. housing stock and you could see the long term trend of continued growth in home ownership, and those massive demographic trends are what give us confidence on moving our business to a more subscription based business that will essentially be attractive to lenders who are trying to play against that trend."

I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our strong fourth quarter and some key highlights from our record 2023 results. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.2 billion and pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight increased 7% versus last year.  For the full year, revenues totaled a record $8 billion and on a pro forma basis increased by 4% year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $952 million, $3 million below the low end of our original guidance range driven by lower compensation expense and acceleration of expense synergies. This strong performance helped to drive fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.33, up 6% year-over-year and record full year adjusted EPS of $5.62, also up 6% versus 2022.  2023 free cash flow totaled a record $3.2 billion enabling us to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends, while also continuing to make strategic investments to reserve September acquisition of Black Knight. These strong cash flows, as well as the full divestment of Black Knight\u2019s stake in Dunn & Bradstreet enabled us to reduce debt outstanding by roughly $700 million in the fourth quarter and by $1.4 billion since we closed on our acquisition in early September. As a result, adjusted leverage ended the year at approximately 4.1 times pro forma EBITDA.  Now let\u2019s move to Slide 5 where I\u2019ll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.1 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $781 million were up 22% in part driven by a 31% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues which grew 46% year-over-year.  This strong performance included a 41% increase in our oil complex, 66% growth in global natural gas revenues, driven by another record-setting quarter for TTF and 23% growth in our environmental business.  In addition, January set the tone for what we expect will be another strong year evidenced by robust levels of total open interest in January, up 20% year-over-year including 22% growth in global energy and 23% growth in Ags, as well as record average daily volumes across commodities, energy and total options.  Shifting to recurring revenues, which include our Exchange Data Services and our NYSE listings business, revenues totaled $355 million in the fourth quarter. Similar to last quarter, growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data was partially offset by the rolling off of initial listing fees related to the strong IPO market in 2021.  It\u2019s worth noting that despite a slower year for IPOs across the globe, the NYSE led the industry in transfers for a second straight year including a total of 32 transfers from other exchanges.  Looking to 2024, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to grow in the low-single-digits driven by continued strong growth in futures exchange data, somewhat offset by growth in our listings business with pressure on initial listing fees abating in the second quarter.  Turning now to Slide 6, I\u2019ll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $563 million, up 4% versus a year ago including transaction revenue of $116 million.  For the full year, transaction revenues increased 19%, in part driven by23% growth at ICE bonds which since our acquisition of BondPoint and TMC has grown at a CAGR of 11% driven by growing institutional adoption and higher interest rates.  Recurring revenues totaled a record $447 million and grew by 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In our Fixed Income Data and Analytics business record fourth quarter revenues of $286 million increased by 4% an acceleration from 2% growth in the third quarter driven by pricing and reference data and a return to double-digit growth in our Index business.  Other data and network services grew 7% in the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth across our desktop fees and derivative analytics offerings. Within our desktops business, we continue to see strong demand from energy and environmental focused customers as well as continued robust growth in our ICE Chat offering.  In our Consolidated Fees business we continue to realize the benefits of past investments to enhance our platforms with a record 2023 contributing to the high single digit revenue CAGR over the last three years. Looking to 2024, we expect to have recurring revenues in our Fixed Income and Data Services business will grow in the mid-single-digit range as we expect the aforementioned trends across Fixed Income, Data and Analytics as well as Desktops and Fees to continue.  Please flip to Slide 7 where I will discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. ICE Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $502 million in the fourth quarter, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. The recurring revenues of $397 million are accounting for roughly 80% of total segment revenues.  In addition, on a pro forma basis, operating income increased 7% year-over-year. We had a strong finish to 2023 registering one of the best quarters for new product sales including 37 new Encompass clients and four new MSP clients. This strong finish capped off what was the best year since 2018 for Encompass and MSP sales. And while these sales will take time to implement and thus recognized related revenue there is clear momentum across the industry as customers seek technology and data solutions that drive greater transparency and workflow efficiencies.  Shifting to 2024 guidance, consistent with the near-term outlook provided on our Black Knight closing call in September, we expect total mortgage technology revenue growth on a pro forma basis to be in the low-single-digit to mid-single-digit range for the full year. The low end of our range assumes only a modest improvement in application and origination volumes, while the high end underwrites a more substantial improvement in the double-digit growth range.  It is worth noting that seasonality tends to benefit both the second and third quarters of each year relative to the first and fourth.  Recurring revenues for the year is expected to be roughly flat including a decline of roughly $5 million to $10 million in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. We expect recurring revenues to improve sequentially thereafter sales implement with the year-over-year growth reemerging in the second half. The sequential pressure and attrition that we expect in the first quarter is largely driven by two customers that were acquired, one of which was a completed back in 2021. Moving to Black Knight synergies, through the first months, five months post close, we have signed annualized revenue synergies of roughly $30 million or nearly a quarter of our $125 million five year target. It\u2019s worth noting that these signings are not expected to have a material impact on our 2024 recurring revenues and will largely begin to be recognized in 2025 and thereafter.  Synergies have largely been driven by cross-sell success across our flagship Encompass and MSP platform, as well as in data and analytics.  Turning to expense synergies, we expect to realize approximately $135 million in annualized savings by the end of 2024, ahead of our original expectation of roughly $100 million by year end.  I\u2019ll conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with some additional guidance. We expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses to be between $3.81 billion and $3.86 billion. Similar to prior years, we expect to continue to invest in our people, our technology, including the enhancement of MSP and various growth initiatives across our business. These investments are somewhat offset by expense synergies which I noted, are expected to reach approximately $135 million in runrate annualized savings by the year end 2024.  Moving below the line, we expect non-operating expense to be between $215 million and $220 million in the first quarter. And depending on the future path of short-term interest rates, these expenses should decline slightly in second quarters as we continue to pay down the outstanding commercial paper and term loan related to our Black Knight acquisitions.  We anticipate the full year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%, up slightly from 2023 through the impacts of a full year higher UK taxes.  And finally, we expect full year CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million including approximately $100 million relating to Black Knight with the vast majority expected to be delivered \u2013 directed to various technology investments that Ben will detail shortly. And $100 million relating to the new office space in expansion and improvement across New York, London and Jacksonville. In summary, we delivered a very strong finish to another record year of revenues, operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share. We grew our dividend returning nearly $1 billion to our shareholders, while at the same time continued to invest across the business to meet the needs of our customers and expand our mortgage technology networks through the acquisition of Black Knight.  As we kick off 2024, we are focused on once again delivering growth and creating shareholder value. I\u2019ll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now hand it over to Ben. \nBenjamin Jackson: Thank you, Warren, and thank you, all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. We are pleased to report another record year for ICE. Our strong 2023 results were in part driven by a dynamic macroeconomic environment. But more importantly, underpinning that performance, our long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes in a variety of macroeconomic environments.  Across our energy markets, the depth and breadth of our global platform not only drove records across volumes and revenues in 2023, but it positions us well to capture secular tailwinds across our energy complex including the globalization of natural gas and the clean energy transition. In our oil markets, we\u2019ve invested in building a global platform that positions us well to provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will help enable participants to navigate the clean energy transition.  Most recently, ICE\u2019s Brent benchmark underwent its latest evolution with the addition of Midland WTI into the Brent basket. This latest evolution contributed to record Brent volumes in 2023, surpassing the record last set in 2021 and demonstrating that the market depends on its ability to reflect global fundamentals.  At the same time, our WTI contract reached record volumes and continues to gain share. In addition, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers are not only seeking liquidity in the major global benchmarks but also in products that provide greater hedging precision. This trend is illustrated by the record trading activity in our other crude and refined products in 2023 with volumes up 35% year-over-year.  This strong performance has carried into 2024 with January ADV surpassing the record last set in March of 2020 and at the same time open interest is up 36%. In our natural gas markets, we\u2019ve adopted a similar playbook building a global platform that expands benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia. As energy supply chains evolve and globalize, the quality of our expansive range of benchmarks is evidence with our global gas business delivering record revenues in 2023 increasing 44% year-over-year.  This strong performance was led by record volumes and participation in our TTF benchmark contract which we have positioned as the branch of natural gas and plays a critical role in providing global natural gas price signals. A similar dynamic is playing out in our Asian JKM complex with volumes up 17% in 2023 and continued participation growth including our highest fourth quarter ever.  In addition, we continue to see robust open interest trends through January including record total gas open interest of nearly 38 million watts on January 25 surpassing the record set in 2012. This strength continues to underscore the significance of our contracts to the price formation of global natural gas.  We were also early to diversify into environmentals recognizing the importance of carbon price transparency over a decade ago. As we look out over the longer term, governments, corporates, and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. As such, valuing externalities such as placing a price on pollution, carbon-free electricity, as well as carbon sequestration, and storage will continue to increase an importance.  This is illustrated by continued growth in active market participants up double-digits in the fourth quarter. At the same time, 2023 marked another record year in our North American environmental markets, with volumes up 7% year-over-year. Importantly, because ICE has one of the largest networks of environmental products to value such externalities across the carbon cycle, this is a growth trend that we are uniquely positioned to capture.  In summary, the globalization of natural gas and the energy transition are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago and today, cleaner energy sources including global natural gas and environmentals make up over 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 17% on average over the past five years. This strong performance has contributed to an average annual revenue growth rate of 9% in our energy platform over that period including 28% growth in 2023.  With our Brent crude oil contract serving as the cornerstone of our energy network, we have expanded the range of contract that we offer to our customers. We have built and continued to enhance our global energy network that delivers comprehensive risk management solutions, provides capital efficiencies and is positioned to grow alongside the continued evolution of global markets, while providing the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to navigate the energy transition.  This large suite of energy risk management tools, combined with our Ags portfolio, which saw record volumes in 2023 and it has consistent open interest records through January makes up our global commodity network of more than 1,000 products and services to help our customers manage risks around evolving supply chain issues, acts of nature and acts of men. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business, market volatility, higher interest rates and secular trends such as the need for increased automation demand for flexible delivery solutions and growth in passive investing contributed to another year of record segment revenues in 2023, up 6% versus a year ago. This strength was once again driven by both transaction and recurring revenue growth, highlighting the strength of our all weather business model.  Higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity across our platform drove another year of record revenues in our ICE bonds business, up 23% in 2023 and that performance was on top of a nearly 100% increase in 2022.  In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments we\u2019ve made in our other data and network services business where revenues grew 7% in 2023. Within desktops, investments we\u2019ve made to reduce friction across the workflow directly contributed to double-digit revenue growth in 2023.  In our consolidated feeds business past investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering led to a number of wins driven by displacements of larger multi-asset class incumbents, a key driver of the high-single-digit growth in this area in 2023.  Finally, as we move forward, our enthusiasm is focused on continuing to expand and evolve the products and services which add transparency to both commonly understood risks as well as emerging risks that make up our fixed income and data services business. Our climate analytics for example, leveraged our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk, as part of their overall investing and risk management processes.  Turning now to our mortgage business, similar to the playbook we operate across our global energy and fixed income businesses, in mortgages we are leveraging market-leading technology, mission-critical data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that drive workflow efficiencies. Our mortgage network expands from point of consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary market providing a true life of loan offering that positions us to lead the transformation of an industry that is moving analogs to digital.  In this regard, we are pleased to share the closed 37 new Encompass clients in the fourth quarter and four new MSP clients contributing to a record for new sales on Encompass and the highest in the last five years for MSP and Encompass combined.  Building on the Encompass wins mentioned on the last call such as M&T Bank, we added Raymond James Bank for their retail and correspondent channels. We also brought back Carrington, a significant non-bank lender and servicer on to the Encompass platform from a third-party.  For MSP, building on the four wins we had in the fourth quarter, such as Fifth Third that was mentioned on the last call, we closed Capital Mortgage Solutions of Texas, and an existing Encompass client, CapEd Credit Union to start 2024. As we entered 2024, we remained focus on the successful integration of Black Knight in executing on our strategy of relieving the paint points and inefficiencies that exists across the mortgage workflow.  Importantly, our approach remains consistent with the blueprint we have applied across our other networks, one of investing behind secular growth, while enhancing the value proposition of our network. A near term opportunity to drive greater transparency and efficiency, includes integrating Black Knight datasets such as our closing fee data, tax, flood and valuation models into our Encompass and MSP systems. Another near term example is integrating our data and document automation platform into MSP, building a digital bridge from originations straight through to servicing reducing costs, time and errors to onboard loans to the MSP system.  A third example builds upon our lead providing compliance solutions fully integrated into every aspect of the mortgage origination process and moving towards servicing as well. At the same time a near term opportunity is our continued investment in our product and pricing engine further strengthening the mortgage ecosystem by providing additional options and greater efficiencies to lenders, servicers and partners.  In parallel to the near term opportunities just mentioned, we are executing on our investment commitments to continue to advance our market-leading SaaS-based MSP servicing platform, following a similar successful process that we execute against with other companies that we have acquired. Simultaneously, we see an opportunity to advance our digital document vault service that is offered for documents such as eNotes and to extend this as a golden record for other origination and servicing documents to help reduce duplication, improve quality and reduce cost for our customers.  In summary, we are pleased to see that the value of our solutions delivered by our comprehensive technology platform is resonating in the marketplace. The demand we are seeing across our platform gives us confidence that we can grow a business that at $2.1 billion in revenue today is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that\u2019s in the early days of analog to digital conversion.  With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffrey Sprecher: Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. 2023 was a unique year for the energy markets. The year kicked off with a European ban on the import of Russian crude oil and a $60 Russian oil price cap imposed by the US, Japan, Canada and Australia, all driven by the Ukrainian conflict and a forced realignment of the global energy supply chain. In October, painful conflict with Israel erupted that is testing relationships within the energy producing Middle East and which caused the US house of representatives to send the bill to the US senate imposing further sanctions on Iranian oil.  In November, terrorists began attacking ships navigating the Red Sea, causing the world\u2019s largest operators of crude oil tankers to modify their supply chain operations out of their region. And throughout 2023 OPEC+ met the set quotas to cut oil production attempting to drive oil prices higher for the benefit of Russia and Middle East producers.  With this complex geopolitical backdrop, it would be reasonable to assume that we ended 2023 with oil prices pushing towards record highs. Well, that\u2019s not the case. Brent crude oil actually ended the year with prices lower than where the year started marking the first annual price decline since the COVID collapse.  Even the recent supply shocks in oil shipped from the Red Sea failed to rally oil prices for more than a day or two. When we acquired the former International Petroleum Exchange of London in the early 2000s its flagship product was a small futures contract on or then not well-known of oil called Brents. The Brent oil field consisted of four deepwater oil platforms built in the 1970s in the middle of the North Sea between Scotland and Norway.  The waters there are deep and the working environment is hostel. So pipelines were built to move the oil to the remote Shetland Islands where Brent was then loaded directly onto seaborne oil tankers. One of the early challenges that ICE faced trying to grow the trading volumes of this Brent futures contract on our newly acquired exchange was the substantial underlying issue that the Brent oilfields were drying up and oil production was deteriorating.  We began working with the oil industry and drove a consensus to allow other grades of oil from locations away from the Brent oilfields to make their way into a newly reconstituted ICE index which we continued to call Brent. Over time, we\u2019ve evolved the index and we\u2019ve added oil from fields of Forties, Oseberg Ekofisk, Troll and most recently, we added US Oil drilled in the Midland basis of West Texas.  The pipeline rail and trucking infrastructure serving the Midland basin drives a large portion of this US oil towards the Gulf of Mexico, where it becomes available for seaborne exports. And the US Oil drillers in this region have been very sensitive to global supply and demand price signals. Their market-based responses have caused their US oil exports to set the marginal price of the ICE Brent index roughly half the time since its latest reconstitution with other global oil grades setting the marginal price for the balance.  The Brent oilfield began decommissioning in 2006 and its first drilling platform seized production in 2011, followed by the second and third platforms stopping in 2014 and 2021. The fourth and final Brent platform has been repurposed to tap into another oilfield. So, today, it\u2019s safe to say that there is no longer any Brent in ICE\u2019s Brent index.  During our index evolution ICE marketed the value of the Brent index to the energy industry at the preferred way to hedge global energy prices. US oil exporters are now leveling out the prices for global crude oil and that\u2019s reflected in the Brent index making the difficult geopolitical shock that I just highlighted less impactful on global oil prices.  The record volume that ICE sees in our Brent oil futures trading complex is a direct result of this focused evolution of our ICE Brent index. I tell this story as an example of how we think about the industries in which we operate. We invest in and constantly work with market participants to transform industries to reflect changing environments. We are following a similar roadmap with our entire energy complex given the analogous macro backdrop of industrialized economies that are attempting to move away from carbon-emitting fuels causing us to list over a 1,000 commodity contracts versus just four contracts when we acquired the IPE. You may have seen our recent announcement that ICE is working with the US Department of Energy to develop regional markets for hydrogen fuels as we continue to focus on medium to long-term cyclical trends and the next energy frontier. Similarly, by creating our ICE Data Services division nearly nine years ago, we spotted the trend that the single most important asset associated with automation was trusted, mission-critical data and digitized information.  We\u2019ve invested in information acquisition, data dissemination and index construction and you are witnessing our data services division extending the same playbook that we ran on Brent to transform global benchmarks for financial products in areas such as credit and interest rates. And these are increasingly making their way on the platforms around the globe including our own in the form of valuations, reference data, cash markets, derivative markets, ETFs, options and equities.  Importantly, we are leaning into this blueprint to drive ICE\u2019s most recent expansion with a goal to expand participation, facilitate information transparency and spot index creation in the US consumer interest rate markets as we move the industry with the SaaS model on a widely distributed network. A blueprint that captures proprietary data and information that we can organize and disseminate to help our customers make better financial decisions in a world where automation and generative models are key to enabling future efficient workflows.  In that vein and shifting to our strong results, 2023 marked our 18th consecutive year of record revenues, record operating income and record adjusted earnings per share, a record every year that we\u2019ve been a public company. This record of growth reflects the quality of our strategy to diversify the business and position the company at the center of some of the largest industries undergoing analog to digital conversions, a strategy that\u2019s made ICE an all weather name which through an array of macroeconomic environments continues to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our stockholders. As we look to 2024 and beyond, we are in a better position than ever to capitalize on secular and cyclical trends that occur across asset classes and we\u2019ve remained focused on investing and executing on many growth opportunities in front of us.  I\u2019d like to conclude these prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2023 and I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to the best year in our company\u2019s history.  And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to our operator Charlie and we\u2019ll conduct a question and answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Craig Siegenthaler of Bank of America. Craig, your line is open. Please go ahead. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, good morning, everyone. We wanted a follow-up on the client attrition commentary at Black Knight and the flat recurring revenue target that you provided in the prepared remarks and we are curious where are the clients going and why are they leaving just given your compelling value proposition with both MSP and Encompass under the same book now?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Craig. This is Ben. And in terms of attritions that we saw, a couple of our clients that have been subject to mergers and acquisitions. On the same token though, we see a benefit from it. And a couple of obvious examples would be JPMorgan buying First Republic. Those moves \u2013 those loans have moved and are moving on to MSP and then you\u2019ll also have RoundPoint and Two Harbors that have come together and have consolidated their loans on MSP. So when you see that type of M&A activity on the servicing side, it\u2019s been pretty much a net-net. If you look across our overall mortgage segment and just looking at the flat performance that we had last year in terms of recurring revenue and the guide Warren gave this year. Underneath that I think it\u2019s important that we are very confident that based on the sales success and the low attrition that we have had that we are clearly gaining share against both proprietary systems, as well as third-party peers during this tremendous decline in market volumes which in particular is on the origination side of the house. And I\u2019d be \u2013 it\u2019s important to highlight as well that 2023 was a generational low in terms of mortgage transaction volumes. So we went back to data that we see as far back to 1991 to find a year that was as bad and it was actually 1991 that was even close and even that year was better. So to us, markets revert to a mean and if you look at the average from 1991 to 2023, the average is around 10 million loans, the mean was around 8, I think we put a conservative band around that 7 to 10 million loans given the market share gains that we\u2019ve had. The significant customers that we are winning and implementing. We believe this platform is springloaded for growth as we turn the corner. \nWarren Gardiner: And Craig, I will make that too on the flat guidance for recurring revenue. So on the implementation side, just to reiterate what Ben said that we do have some good visibility into some of the MSP and Encompass sales that are coming online throughout the year and those are the products that are going to really move the needle.  On the erosion side, absent of course the one that I mentioned around M&A. Renewals on Encompass and customer engagement, that\u2019s some of the stuff that pressures last year. We still expect some of that, but we\u2019ve seen those trends start to stabilize and actually start to improve in the fourth quarter and into early this year. What I obviously don\u2019t know it\u2019s had visibility into is some of those things like an M&A activity related to our customers. But overall, we feel pretty good about that guide and Ben touched on this too. I think it\u2019s important to really note, well, of course those recurring revenues are important. A lot of these products are also going to have a transaction component to it. And as he noted, we are coming off with the worst year for originations in a generation, but we\u2019ve continue to add new customers, the current customer base is continue to add additional products and we\u2019ve expanded that network. So that when those transactions do normalize, we are going to be really benefiting from that not only on the recurring side, but I think on the transaction side as well. And maybe to help frame that a little bit for you, I think if you were to see industry loan volumes in that $7 million to $10 million loan range, again with $10 million being the average over the last 30 years, we\u2019d see a couple $100 million to nearly $0.5 billion of incremental transaction revenue and that would be a revenue that would be coming at really high incremental margin. So, look, we are focused on investing in the platform, expanding the network, so that we are best positioned for when this market normalizes. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Clinch of Redburn Atlantic. Simon, your line is open. Please go ahead. \nSimon Clinch : Thanks for taking my question. I was sort of interested in how you would frame, I guess, when we look at, could you give us a sense what the market origination market was like in the fourth quarter in terms of unit volume growth? And then ultimately, just how you are thinking about the potential product springloaded recovery? What are the sort of mortgage rate conditions you can \u2013 we need to see that kind of real inflection and acceleration starts compared futures with quota? Thanks.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Simon. In terms of composite estimates that are out there, so if you look at the industry bodies that put out industry volume estimates, the market was approximately down 11%, what our modeling shows and if you take a composite of the industry analyst that\u2019s above where it is. I think in terms of couple data points I can share as I said, there is no question in our mind that we are gaining share in terms of against both proprietary platforms and third-party platforms and a lot of those clients because they are significant in size or in the implementation phase. So the benefits we\u2019ll get from recurring revenues will take some time as we implement those clients. The other benefit that we get when those clients are implemented is that those are new loans on our platform that will get per closed transaction fees on and those loans will also interact with hundreds of third-party service providers we have on our network. So when you are ordering a credit report for example, we get a fee for the efficiency that we provide on ordering those services on our networks. So those are additional transaction revenues that we would also benefit from in that case. The other thing that I\u2019d say is that if you look at closed loans on our platform as we look at the closed loans that we saw on our platform were roughly mid-digit percentage points ahead of where the composite estimates are which further is evidence that we are gaining share and springloading this platform for when market volumes stabilize and Warren gave that range of couple hundred million to a half a billion in his comments just a minute ago. So I think that helps to frame when we say that the business is springloaded what that actually means.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ken Worthington of JPMorgan. Ken, your line is open. Please proceed. \nKen Worthington : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to follow-up on your comments on energy. Maybe first touch gas Hawaii has doubled over the last year. How much of the European gas market is on exchange at this point? And where does this go relative to sort of the OTC market? Where is that balance? And in oil, you called that the share shift to ICE and WTI that seems to coincide into some extent with the reconstitution of Brent, what is driving the share shift to ICE and TI? And how much further do you think there is to shift there? \nBenjamin Jackson: Hey, Ken. It\u2019s Ben. Thanks for the question. So I\u2019ll start on TTF. So, TTF, a lot of that volume is now on exchange and has transitioned over 10 plus years that we\u2019ve seen that transition happening. I think the next step in the evolution of TTF that we see and I alluded to this in my prepared remarks is that, this is becoming and really has become the global benchmark for natural gas around the world. And it\u2019s being more and more as a proxy for, when you are trading LNG and that\u2019s seeing shifts around the world, which you can underestimate and you follow these markets very closely, you can underestimate the impact of the liberalization of natural gas has had to really creating a global natural gas market. It\u2019s no longer subject to being secular pipeline infrastructure and storages. It can be freely transported around the world. And that is where we are seeing the growth in the TTF contracts and that\u2019s why we constantly point out we are seeing new records, double-digit growth in terms of market participants, significant double-digit growth in terms of data subscriptions in TTF. TTF is up 100% in open interest year-over-year, 45% in ADV this year as more and more clients as they are looking at global issues around the movement of LNG out of the US going into Europe. They need to think about longer term implications of the White House recently announcing pauses on new LNG exports going out. US LNG heading east bound that goes through the Red Sea and Jeff alluded to it in his comments impacts that the attacks in the Red Sea it had on shipping there. US LNG going out of the Gulf going to Asia and when it\u2019s going west bound has to go through the Panama Canal that same unbelievable drought conditions impacting that. These are all risks that people need to manage and it\u2019s the TTF contract that we are now doing that with. So we see a lot of growth in that as that continues to evolve to be a global benchmark similar to what Brent is clearly today.  On WTI, really it goes to the a lot of the investments we have made in the innovation we\u2019ve made in the oil market around that HOU contracts which is Midland WTI basis Houston, a physically delivered contract that we launched a couple of years back that\u2019s been growing significantly, which is pricing WTI oil basis Houston, that\u2019s going into the Atlantic basin and a lot of that being delivered into Europe. People that hedge and trade in those markets are trading those off the cornerstone of Brent are also using our HOU contract and then as a package that also trade WTI and for the efficiencies that they get trading in those Brent markets across those three contracts. We are seeing more and more of that trading volume moving to our exchange. So that\u2019s on the second part of your question around WTI. That\u2019s what we see is driving a lot of that growth in market share.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Budish of Barclays. Ben, your line is open. Please go ahead.\nBen Budish : Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. I wanted to circle back to the Mortgage segment. Just on the cost side, Warren, it sounds like you accelerated some of the cost synergies in 2024. Is there anything more we can read into that in terms of the potentially the total bucket of synergies identified or the pacing of the additional synergies beyond what you see this year? And then, one other question that\u2019s sort of come back along the same lines in terms of not so much cost synergies but perhaps things that ICE could do. Now that you and Black note that that Black Knight was unable to do while the merger was sort of pending. Any update in terms of additional cost reductions that are not quite true M&A synergies but just other things you may be able to do there? Thank you. \nBenjamin Jackson: Yeah, sure Ben. So, yeah, look, I think it\u2019s a testament to the organization in the sense that we were very well prepared for this deal to close and we really hit the ground running. And so, not only is a testament to the ability for us to kind of get all of our ducks in a row, but also just flexing the muscle that I think we\u2019ve shown over the last number of years that integrations like this it\u2019s definitely a skill set of ours. So, I think to some extent it\u2019s very much a testament to do those two things in terms of us being a little bit better than we initially spoke to when we announced the deal around our Year One synergies. So, look, it does certainly make us feel comfortable about getting to our target of $200 million by the end of year five having coming in as strongly as we are right out of the gates here. But as we move through this year, I think we will take the opportunity to see how that unfolds and if there is any clarity on that and if there is potential to increase those, we\u2019ll certainly let you know. But right now, look we are five months into the same things are going very well and we are really just making progress towards those targets. \nWarren Gardiner: And Ben, I\u2019ll pick up on that on other things that we are seeing. We\u2019ve mentioned on prior calls things like our proprietary cloud being something that\u2019s \u2013 that we are very proud of in terms of the scalability, the architecture, the operational resiliency, the cyber capabilities that we have there. So we see an opportunity over time to move some of the core technology platforms there to our proprietary cloud and we are planning around that right now and there is a lot of benefits our clients will get from that. Other things that we see is, we are enhancing the MSP platform. So that\u2019s SaaS-based platform that MSP has. We are continuing to enhance this. Leveraging our experience in upgrading technology. The analogy we\u2019ve used in the past, we have to upgrade technology while the cars are driving over the bridge. We have done this time and time again and once business at NYSE and with our ICE Data Services business. So leveraging our expertise is scalable, distributed architecture is all things that we are going to apply towards the enhancements of MSP and making it as efficient of an enhancement as possible. And then the last thing I\u2019d say is, we\u2019ve moved our Black Knight data team. That\u2019s come over, in particular the product team over to our ICE Data Services division and the reason we did that is we think there is going to be two benefits from that. Number one is from the technology side, are there technology capabilities within ICE Data Services or Black Knight that both sides can take advantage of and the early returns are, yes there are. And then number two is our product innovation. There is a number of data sets within Black Knight that are highly applicable to the capital markets space and we believe that with our capital markets expertise within ICE Data Services, there is a lot of new product innovation that we can put out there that will generate benefits both short and medium term.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell of Deutsche Bank. Brian, your line is open. Please go ahead. \nBrian Bedell : Great. Thanks. Good morning, folks. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just focus on the revenue synergy side in Mortgage tech. I think you said you\u2019ve signed $30 million of the $125 million total so far in just five months and then the $125 million is the five year target that it seems like you are tracking. You are well ahead of that and then maybe just sort of correlating that with the commentary you had a couple of calls on the $300 million of revenue synergy opportunities that you\u2019ve identified. Just trying to see if the $30 million is part of that $300 million? And I guess the broader question is, do you feel like you are also tracking ahead maybe well ahead on the revenue synergy side as you are on the expense review?\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks, Brian. And you categorize that $300 million that I outlined before. And I think what we are seeing is that the clients one they appreciate and have had a lot of experience working with ICE and our test capabilities have running highly efficient utility type technology infrastructure for them. And that we do this in very efficient ways and we have deep relationships with all of these clients, which I think has really accelerated our ability to hit these revenue synergy targets. And getting ahead of that is quickly as we have only being five months after we\u2019ve done the deal. If you look at the three categories I outlined there, there is one of cross-selling Encompass into roughly 40 of the top 100 MSP clients. And right out of the gates we had a big win there. We mentioned JPMorgan Chase in 2023 that we obviously have big relationships with across all of ICE. And then, in the fourth quarter we added M&T Bank very quickly after we closed. So those are some great examples and that that fit into that first category that take time to implement. The second category is cross-selling MSP into our ICE Mortgage Technology client base. We have thousands and thousands of lenders that are in the ICE Mortgage Technology client base that are leveraging various pieces of technology from us and right out of the gates we had some significant wins in the fourth quarter, Fifth Third Bank, another big super regional bank is in the process of moving to MSPs. That was a great win. I mentioned Black Hills Federal Credit Union in the fourth quarter. They are an ICE Mortgage Technology client as well as Mortgage Solutions of Colorado. And then in my prepared remarks, I also mentioned CapEd Credit Union. So they are an existing Encompass client, as well. So they are adding MSP seeing the addition of us pulling together this complete front to back network.  In the third category, this is expanding our network while cross-selling a lot of our technology platform, ancillary products and data solutions. And here we\u2019ve also seen some great success. So we\u2019ve cross sold a lot of our Black Knight data sets alongside our deal with Fifth Third Bank and MSP. We\u2019ve included our data and document automation platform with the M&T Bank, deal that we closed in the fourth quarter. I think some other areas that we are just now, because we had do some near term integration work that we are just now positioned to start to cross-sell is another important thing to highlight as we \u2013 one of the first things we integrated is we took our Simplifile platform and the incredible network that Simplifile has with all of the local counties around the US and we\u2019ve embedded that network into the, really the back end workflow of MSP, our servicing platform and we are now utilizing that to automate lean releases. So when a loan is paid off on the MSP platform, we can leverage the Simplifile rails to make it highly efficient and effective and very quick to actually effect that lean release which will be additional transaction revenue for us.  I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we\u2019ve integrated our data and document automation platform into MSP. So this is on the front end of the MSP process that we now have our first real integration between Encompass and MSP where we are taking that digital loan file as it\u2019s compiled and can map that now directly into MSP and automate the onboarding of loans. And then we\u2019ve also completed a significant amount of the integration work needed for our proprietary data sets such as closing fees valuations tax and flood and now have the ability to cross-sell all of these data sets that we\u2019ve not had historically a proprietary solution on our Encompass platform. So we can now cross sell that to our client base. So we\u2019ve had a lot of great wins. Those are lot of great successes and update on that, but also some things you will be hearing about more in the future as we are now able to start to distribute these.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon of Jefferies. Dan, your line is open. Please go ahead. \nDan Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. Warren, just a question on the balance sheet. I think you said $700 million debt paydown in quarter-over-quarter. That\u2019s probably a bit elevated. But what is a reasonable kind of quarterly pace and as you think about that progress, also do you anticipate being able to buy back stock as you kind of get towards the latter part of this year or early next year? What\u2019s the reasonable timeframe to think about the capital return story improving? \nWarren Gardiner: Sure. Thanks, Dan. So I think, look, we don\u2019t give sort of forward free cash flow guidance. But we certainly did just report a strong year at $3.2 billion of free cash flow with only about a quarter or so of Black Knight in there. So, that coupled with growth. I think it\u2019s fair to assume that\u2019ll be better than that in 2024 at the end \u2013 as we said, at the moment, our plan is to return the vast majority of that not return I should say, our plan is to use the vast majority of that to pay down the outstanding debt that\u2019s out there today. And so, I think is we are thinking about that in the go forward here. I still think we are on track here as we\u2019ve talked about where we thought for that paydown schedule being sometime in 2025, but depending on forms this could be a little bit earlier in that, as well. So, we are going to have to just sort of see how the year plays out ultimately, but as I said, very much on track to what we thought we\u2019d be and where we would be in terms of our deleveraging phase.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt of KBW. Kyle, your line is open. Please proceed.\nKyle Voigt : Hi, good morning. So last year in May, you increased futures transaction fees for the first time in many years. Some of your competitors have announced pricing changes again for 2024. So I just wanted to circle back on how those pricing changes in May were digested by the market. And can you provide some updated thoughts on how you are thinking about pricing across the futures complex at this point and whether anything is planned for 2024?\nWarren Gardiner: Sure. Kyle, it\u2019s Warren. So, as we said in the past, back in May, you are right, we did increased a couple of contracts across our oil business that something we hadn\u2019t done in a number of years and I\u2019d say it went pretty well. I think you saw the impact \u2013 we see to some extent as we move through the year and obviously the volumes were record levels and continue to be so in January of this year, as well. So I would say that that was \u2013 that went well. As we\u2019ve said to you all in the past, our philosophy is to really look across the platform and look for areas where we have created value and where we can then go capture value. And so we do that every year and we think about it in different ways or utilize it in different ways and as we think about this year what we\u2019ve done within the futures business, we did make some adjustments to the exchange data fees. We\u2019ve done some price adjustments around some of the energy contracts outside of our oil business and then we also made some adjustments on collateral fees at the clearing house which in aggregate actually we are pretty similar to what the impact would have been or was I should say from the changes we made to the oil contracts last year. So, again, we\u2019ve done a similar exercise but executed it in somewhat of a different way and I think that\u2019s part of the opportunity we have going forward as we think about the futures business and ICE probably in terms from a pricing strategy standpoint.\nOperator: Thank you. This is all the time we have for questions today. So hand back over to Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO for any closing remarks.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Well, thank you, Charlie for managing the call for us this morning. Before we leave, I wanted to mention that every quarter for the last ten years before and after these earnings announcements, we receive a call and input from a shareholder named Jack Willins. And we didn\u2019t hear from Jack this week. So we did some outreach and learned that he had recently passed at age 88 and I just wanted to acknowledge the fact that his family and friends and colleagues that we also miss hearing from him.  And we are going to go back to work after this call to continue to build this all weather business model and that\u2019s what he would have wanted us to do. And so today, we will do it in his honor. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may all disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our strong fourth quarter and some key highlights from our record 2023 results. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.2 billion and pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight increased 7% versus last year.  For the full year, revenues totaled a record $8 billion and on a pro forma basis increased by 4% year-over-year. Fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $952 million, $3 million below the low end of our original guidance range driven by lower compensation expense and acceleration of expense synergies. This strong performance helped to drive fourth quarter earnings per share of $1.33, up 6% year-over-year and record full year adjusted EPS of $5.62, also up 6% versus 2022.  2023 free cash flow totaled a record $3.2 billion enabling us to return nearly $1 billion to shareholders through dividends, while also continuing to make strategic investments to reserve September acquisition of Black Knight. These strong cash flows, as well as the full divestment of Black Knight's stake in Dunn & Bradstreet enabled us to reduce debt outstanding by roughly $700 million in the fourth quarter and by $1.4 billion since we closed on our acquisition in early September. As a result, adjusted leverage ended the year at approximately 4.1 times pro forma EBITDA.  Now let's move to Slide 5 where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Fourth quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.1 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $781 million were up 22% in part driven by a 31% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues which grew 46% year-over-year.  This strong performance included a 41% increase in our oil complex, 66% growth in global natural gas revenues, driven by another record-setting quarter for TTF and 23% growth in our environmental business.  In addition, January set the tone for what we expect will be another strong year evidenced by robust levels of total open interest in January, up 20% year-over-year including 22% growth in global energy and 23% growth in Ags, as well as record average daily volumes across commodities, energy and total options.  Shifting to recurring revenues, which include our Exchange Data Services and our NYSE listings business, revenues totaled $355 million in the fourth quarter. Similar to last quarter, growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data was partially offset by the rolling off of initial listing fees related to the strong IPO market in 2021.  It's worth noting that despite a slower year for IPOs across the globe, the NYSE led the industry in transfers for a second straight year including a total of 32 transfers from other exchanges.  Looking to 2024, we expect recurring revenues in our Exchange segment to grow in the low-single-digits driven by continued strong growth in futures exchange data, somewhat offset by growth in our listings business with pressure on initial listing fees abating in the second quarter.  Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Fourth quarter revenues totaled a record $563 million, up 4% versus a year ago including transaction revenue of $116 million.  For the full year, transaction revenues increased 19%, in part driven by23% growth at ICE bonds which since our acquisition of BondPoint and TMC has grown at a CAGR of 11% driven by growing institutional adoption and higher interest rates.  Recurring revenues totaled a record $447 million and grew by 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. In our Fixed Income Data and Analytics business record fourth quarter revenues of $286 million increased by 4% an acceleration from 2% growth in the third quarter driven by pricing and reference data and a return to double-digit growth in our Index business.  Other data and network services grew 7% in the fourth quarter, driven by continued growth across our desktop fees and derivative analytics offerings. Within our desktops business, we continue to see strong demand from energy and environmental focused customers as well as continued robust growth in our ICE Chat offering.  In our Consolidated Fees business we continue to realize the benefits of past investments to enhance our platforms with a record 2023 contributing to the high single digit revenue CAGR over the last three years. Looking to 2024, we expect to have recurring revenues in our Fixed Income and Data Services business will grow in the mid-single-digit range as we expect the aforementioned trends across Fixed Income, Data and Analytics as well as Desktops and Fees to continue.  Please flip to Slide 7 where I will discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments on revenue growth are on a pro forma basis. ICE Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $502 million in the fourth quarter, slightly above the high end of our guidance range. The recurring revenues of $397 million are accounting for roughly 80% of total segment revenues.  In addition, on a pro forma basis, operating income increased 7% year-over-year. We had a strong finish to 2023 registering one of the best quarters for new product sales including 37 new Encompass clients and four new MSP clients. This strong finish capped off what was the best year since 2018 for Encompass and MSP sales. And while these sales will take time to implement and thus recognized related revenue there is clear momentum across the industry as customers seek technology and data solutions that drive greater transparency and workflow efficiencies.  Shifting to 2024 guidance, consistent with the near-term outlook provided on our Black Knight closing call in September, we expect total mortgage technology revenue growth on a pro forma basis to be in the low-single-digit to mid-single-digit range for the full year. The low end of our range assumes only a modest improvement in application and origination volumes, while the high end underwrites a more substantial improvement in the double-digit growth range.  It is worth noting that seasonality tends to benefit both the second and third quarters of each year relative to the first and fourth.  Recurring revenues for the year is expected to be roughly flat including a decline of roughly $5 million to $10 million in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter. We expect recurring revenues to improve sequentially thereafter sales implement with the year-over-year growth reemerging in the second half. The sequential pressure and attrition that we expect in the first quarter is largely driven by two customers that were acquired, one of which was a completed back in 2021. Moving to Black Knight synergies, through the first months, five months post close, we have signed annualized revenue synergies of roughly $30 million or nearly a quarter of our $125 million five year target. It's worth noting that these signings are not expected to have a material impact on our 2024 recurring revenues and will largely begin to be recognized in 2025 and thereafter.  Synergies have largely been driven by cross-sell success across our flagship Encompass and MSP platform, as well as in data and analytics.  Turning to expense synergies, we expect to realize approximately $135 million in annualized savings by the end of 2024, ahead of our original expectation of roughly $100 million by year end.  I'll conclude my remarks on Slide 8 with some additional guidance. We expect 2024 adjusted operating expenses to be between $3.81 billion and $3.86 billion. Similar to prior years, we expect to continue to invest in our people, our technology, including the enhancement of MSP and various growth initiatives across our business. These investments are somewhat offset by expense synergies which I noted, are expected to reach approximately $135 million in runrate annualized savings by the year end 2024.  Moving below the line, we expect non-operating expense to be between $215 million and $220 million in the first quarter. And depending on the future path of short-term interest rates, these expenses should decline slightly in second quarters as we continue to pay down the outstanding commercial paper and term loan related to our Black Knight acquisitions.  We anticipate the full year tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%, up slightly from 2023 through the impacts of a full year higher UK taxes.  And finally, we expect full year CapEx to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million including approximately $100 million relating to Black Knight with the vast majority expected to be delivered \u2013 directed to various technology investments that Ben will detail shortly. And $100 million relating to the new office space in expansion and improvement across New York, London and Jacksonville. In summary, we delivered a very strong finish to another record year of revenues, operating income, free cash flow and earnings per share. We grew our dividend returning nearly $1 billion to our shareholders, while at the same time continued to invest across the business to meet the needs of our customers and expand our mortgage technology networks through the acquisition of Black Knight.  As we kick off 2024, we are focused on once again delivering growth and creating shareholder value. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now hand it over to Ben. And Craig, I will make that too on the flat guidance for recurring revenue. So on the implementation side, just to reiterate what Ben said that we do have some good visibility into some of the MSP and Encompass sales that are coming online throughout the year and those are the products that are going to really move the needle.  On the erosion side, absent of course the one that I mentioned around M&A. Renewals on Encompass and customer engagement, that's some of the stuff that pressures last year. We still expect some of that, but we've seen those trends start to stabilize and actually start to improve in the fourth quarter and into early this year. What I obviously don't know it's had visibility into is some of those things like an M&A activity related to our customers. But overall, we feel pretty good about that guide and Ben touched on this too. I think it's important to really note, well, of course those recurring revenues are important. A lot of these products are also going to have a transaction component to it. And as he noted, we are coming off with the worst year for originations in a generation, but we've continue to add new customers, the current customer base is continue to add additional products and we've expanded that network. So that when those transactions do normalize, we are going to be really benefiting from that not only on the recurring side, but I think on the transaction side as well. And maybe to help frame that a little bit for you, I think if you were to see industry loan volumes in that $7 million to $10 million loan range, again with $10 million being the average over the last 30 years, we'd see a couple $100 million to nearly $0.5 billion of incremental transaction revenue and that would be a revenue that would be coming at really high incremental margin. So, look, we are focused on investing in the platform, expanding the network, so that we are best positioned for when this market normalizes. And Ben, I'll pick up on that on other things that we are seeing. We've mentioned on prior calls things like our proprietary cloud being something that's \u2013 that we are very proud of in terms of the scalability, the architecture, the operational resiliency, the cyber capabilities that we have there. So we see an opportunity over time to move some of the core technology platforms there to our proprietary cloud and we are planning around that right now and there is a lot of benefits our clients will get from that. Other things that we see is, we are enhancing the MSP platform. So that's SaaS-based platform that MSP has. We are continuing to enhance this. Leveraging our experience in upgrading technology. The analogy we've used in the past, we have to upgrade technology while the cars are driving over the bridge. We have done this time and time again and once business at NYSE and with our ICE Data Services business. So leveraging our expertise is scalable, distributed architecture is all things that we are going to apply towards the enhancements of MSP and making it as efficient of an enhancement as possible. And then the last thing I'd say is, we've moved our Black Knight data team. That's come over, in particular the product team over to our ICE Data Services division and the reason we did that is we think there is going to be two benefits from that. Number one is from the technology side, are there technology capabilities within ICE Data Services or Black Knight that both sides can take advantage of and the early returns are, yes there are. And then number two is our product innovation. There is a number of data sets within Black Knight that are highly applicable to the capital markets space and we believe that with our capital markets expertise within ICE Data Services, there is a lot of new product innovation that we can put out there that will generate benefits both short and medium term. Thanks, Brian. And you categorize that $300 million that I outlined before. And I think what we are seeing is that the clients one they appreciate and have had a lot of experience working with ICE and our test capabilities have running highly efficient utility type technology infrastructure for them. And that we do this in very efficient ways and we have deep relationships with all of these clients, which I think has really accelerated our ability to hit these revenue synergy targets. And getting ahead of that is quickly as we have only being five months after we've done the deal. If you look at the three categories I outlined there, there is one of cross-selling Encompass into roughly 40 of the top 100 MSP clients. And right out of the gates we had a big win there. We mentioned JPMorgan Chase in 2023 that we obviously have big relationships with across all of ICE. And then, in the fourth quarter we added M&T Bank very quickly after we closed. So those are some great examples and that that fit into that first category that take time to implement. The second category is cross-selling MSP into our ICE Mortgage Technology client base. We have thousands and thousands of lenders that are in the ICE Mortgage Technology client base that are leveraging various pieces of technology from us and right out of the gates we had some significant wins in the fourth quarter, Fifth Third Bank, another big super regional bank is in the process of moving to MSPs. That was a great win. I mentioned Black Hills Federal Credit Union in the fourth quarter. They are an ICE Mortgage Technology client as well as Mortgage Solutions of Colorado. And then in my prepared remarks, I also mentioned CapEd Credit Union. So they are an existing Encompass client, as well. So they are adding MSP seeing the addition of us pulling together this complete front to back network.  In the third category, this is expanding our network while cross-selling a lot of our technology platform, ancillary products and data solutions. And here we've also seen some great success. So we've cross sold a lot of our Black Knight data sets alongside our deal with Fifth Third Bank and MSP. We've included our data and document automation platform with the M&T Bank, deal that we closed in the fourth quarter. I think some other areas that we are just now, because we had do some near term integration work that we are just now positioned to start to cross-sell is another important thing to highlight as we \u2013 one of the first things we integrated is we took our Simplifile platform and the incredible network that Simplifile has with all of the local counties around the US and we've embedded that network into the, really the back end workflow of MSP, our servicing platform and we are now utilizing that to automate lean releases. So when a loan is paid off on the MSP platform, we can leverage the Simplifile rails to make it highly efficient and effective and very quick to actually effect that lean release which will be additional transaction revenue for us.  I mentioned in my prepared remarks that we've integrated our data and document automation platform into MSP. So this is on the front end of the MSP process that we now have our first real integration between Encompass and MSP where we are taking that digital loan file as it's compiled and can map that now directly into MSP and automate the onboarding of loans. And then we've also completed a significant amount of the integration work needed for our proprietary data sets such as closing fees valuations tax and flood and now have the ability to cross-sell all of these data sets that we've not had historically a proprietary solution on our Encompass platform. So we can now cross sell that to our client base. So we've had a lot of great wins. Those are lot of great successes and update on that, but also some things you will be hearing about more in the future as we are now able to start to distribute these. Sure. Thanks, Dan. So I think, look, we don't give sort of forward free cash flow guidance. But we certainly did just report a strong year at $3.2 billion of free cash flow with only about a quarter or so of Black Knight in there. So, that coupled with growth. I think it's fair to assume that'll be better than that in 2024 at the end \u2013 as we said, at the moment, our plan is to return the vast majority of that not return I should say, our plan is to use the vast majority of that to pay down the outstanding debt that's out there today. And so, I think is we are thinking about that in the go forward here. I still think we are on track here as we've talked about where we thought for that paydown schedule being sometime in 2025, but depending on forms this could be a little bit earlier in that, as well. So, we are going to have to just sort of see how the year plays out ultimately, but as I said, very much on track to what we thought we'd be and where we would be in terms of our deleveraging phase. Sure. Kyle, it's Warren. So, as we said in the past, back in May, you are right, we did increased a couple of contracts across our oil business that something we hadn't done in a number of years and I'd say it went pretty well. I think you saw the impact \u2013 we see to some extent as we move through the year and obviously the volumes were record levels and continue to be so in January of this year, as well. So I would say that that was \u2013 that went well. As we've said to you all in the past, our philosophy is to really look across the platform and look for areas where we have created value and where we can then go capture value. And so we do that every year and we think about it in different ways or utilize it in different ways and as we think about this year what we've done within the futures business, we did make some adjustments to the exchange data fees. We've done some price adjustments around some of the energy contracts outside of our oil business and then we also made some adjustments on collateral fees at the clearing house which in aggregate actually we are pretty similar to what the impact would have been or was I should say from the changes we made to the oil contracts last year. So, again, we've done a similar exercise but executed it in somewhat of a different way and I think that's part of the opportunity we have going forward as we think about the futures business and ICE probably in terms from a pricing strategy standpoint."

            "name": "Benjamin Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren, and thank you, all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. We are pleased to report another record year for ICE. Our strong 2023 results were in part driven by a dynamic macroeconomic environment. But more importantly, underpinning that performance, our long-term secular tailwinds that will continue to drive growth across asset classes in a variety of macroeconomic environments.  Across our energy markets, the depth and breadth of our global platform not only drove records across volumes and revenues in 2023, but it positions us well to capture secular tailwinds across our energy complex including the globalization of natural gas and the clean energy transition. In our oil markets, we've invested in building a global platform that positions us well to provide the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum that will help enable participants to navigate the clean energy transition.  Most recently, ICE's Brent benchmark underwent its latest evolution with the addition of Midland WTI into the Brent basket. This latest evolution contributed to record Brent volumes in 2023, surpassing the record last set in 2021 and demonstrating that the market depends on its ability to reflect global fundamentals.  At the same time, our WTI contract reached record volumes and continues to gain share. In addition, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers are not only seeking liquidity in the major global benchmarks but also in products that provide greater hedging precision. This trend is illustrated by the record trading activity in our other crude and refined products in 2023 with volumes up 35% year-over-year.  This strong performance has carried into 2024 with January ADV surpassing the record last set in March of 2020 and at the same time open interest is up 36%. In our natural gas markets, we've adopted a similar playbook building a global platform that expands benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia. As energy supply chains evolve and globalize, the quality of our expansive range of benchmarks is evidence with our global gas business delivering record revenues in 2023 increasing 44% year-over-year.  This strong performance was led by record volumes and participation in our TTF benchmark contract which we have positioned as the branch of natural gas and plays a critical role in providing global natural gas price signals. A similar dynamic is playing out in our Asian JKM complex with volumes up 17% in 2023 and continued participation growth including our highest fourth quarter ever.  In addition, we continue to see robust open interest trends through January including record total gas open interest of nearly 38 million watts on January 25 surpassing the record set in 2012. This strength continues to underscore the significance of our contracts to the price formation of global natural gas.  We were also early to diversify into environmentals recognizing the importance of carbon price transparency over a decade ago. As we look out over the longer term, governments, corporates, and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. As such, valuing externalities such as placing a price on pollution, carbon-free electricity, as well as carbon sequestration, and storage will continue to increase an importance.  This is illustrated by continued growth in active market participants up double-digits in the fourth quarter. At the same time, 2023 marked another record year in our North American environmental markets, with volumes up 7% year-over-year. Importantly, because ICE has one of the largest networks of environmental products to value such externalities across the carbon cycle, this is a growth trend that we are uniquely positioned to capture.  In summary, the globalization of natural gas and the energy transition are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago and today, cleaner energy sources including global natural gas and environmentals make up over 40% of our energy revenues and have grown 17% on average over the past five years. This strong performance has contributed to an average annual revenue growth rate of 9% in our energy platform over that period including 28% growth in 2023.  With our Brent crude oil contract serving as the cornerstone of our energy network, we have expanded the range of contract that we offer to our customers. We have built and continued to enhance our global energy network that delivers comprehensive risk management solutions, provides capital efficiencies and is positioned to grow alongside the continued evolution of global markets, while providing the critical price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to navigate the energy transition.  This large suite of energy risk management tools, combined with our Ags portfolio, which saw record volumes in 2023 and it has consistent open interest records through January makes up our global commodity network of more than 1,000 products and services to help our customers manage risks around evolving supply chain issues, acts of nature and acts of men. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business, market volatility, higher interest rates and secular trends such as the need for increased automation demand for flexible delivery solutions and growth in passive investing contributed to another year of record segment revenues in 2023, up 6% versus a year ago. This strength was once again driven by both transaction and recurring revenue growth, highlighting the strength of our all weather business model.  Higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity across our platform drove another year of record revenues in our ICE bonds business, up 23% in 2023 and that performance was on top of a nearly 100% increase in 2022.  In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments we've made in our other data and network services business where revenues grew 7% in 2023. Within desktops, investments we've made to reduce friction across the workflow directly contributed to double-digit revenue growth in 2023.  In our consolidated feeds business past investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering led to a number of wins driven by displacements of larger multi-asset class incumbents, a key driver of the high-single-digit growth in this area in 2023.  Finally, as we move forward, our enthusiasm is focused on continuing to expand and evolve the products and services which add transparency to both commonly understood risks as well as emerging risks that make up our fixed income and data services business. Our climate analytics for example, leveraged our strength in the fixed income market with third-party geospatial data to help market participants better manage climate risk, as part of their overall investing and risk management processes.  Turning now to our mortgage business, similar to the playbook we operate across our global energy and fixed income businesses, in mortgages we are leveraging market-leading technology, mission-critical data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that drive workflow efficiencies. Our mortgage network expands from point of consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary market providing a true life of loan offering that positions us to lead the transformation of an industry that is moving analogs to digital.  In this regard, we are pleased to share the closed 37 new Encompass clients in the fourth quarter and four new MSP clients contributing to a record for new sales on Encompass and the highest in the last five years for MSP and Encompass combined.  Building on the Encompass wins mentioned on the last call such as M&T Bank, we added Raymond James Bank for their retail and correspondent channels. We also brought back Carrington, a significant non-bank lender and servicer on to the Encompass platform from a third-party.  For MSP, building on the four wins we had in the fourth quarter, such as Fifth Third that was mentioned on the last call, we closed Capital Mortgage Solutions of Texas, and an existing Encompass client, CapEd Credit Union to start 2024. As we entered 2024, we remained focus on the successful integration of Black Knight in executing on our strategy of relieving the paint points and inefficiencies that exists across the mortgage workflow.  Importantly, our approach remains consistent with the blueprint we have applied across our other networks, one of investing behind secular growth, while enhancing the value proposition of our network. A near term opportunity to drive greater transparency and efficiency, includes integrating Black Knight datasets such as our closing fee data, tax, flood and valuation models into our Encompass and MSP systems. Another near term example is integrating our data and document automation platform into MSP, building a digital bridge from originations straight through to servicing reducing costs, time and errors to onboard loans to the MSP system.  A third example builds upon our lead providing compliance solutions fully integrated into every aspect of the mortgage origination process and moving towards servicing as well. At the same time a near term opportunity is our continued investment in our product and pricing engine further strengthening the mortgage ecosystem by providing additional options and greater efficiencies to lenders, servicers and partners.  In parallel to the near term opportunities just mentioned, we are executing on our investment commitments to continue to advance our market-leading SaaS-based MSP servicing platform, following a similar successful process that we execute against with other companies that we have acquired. Simultaneously, we see an opportunity to advance our digital document vault service that is offered for documents such as eNotes and to extend this as a golden record for other origination and servicing documents to help reduce duplication, improve quality and reduce cost for our customers.  In summary, we are pleased to see that the value of our solutions delivered by our comprehensive technology platform is resonating in the marketplace. The demand we are seeing across our platform gives us confidence that we can grow a business that at $2.1 billion in revenue today is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that's in the early days of analog to digital conversion.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Thanks, Craig. This is Ben. And in terms of attritions that we saw, a couple of our clients that have been subject to mergers and acquisitions. On the same token though, we see a benefit from it. And a couple of obvious examples would be JPMorgan buying First Republic. Those moves \u2013 those loans have moved and are moving on to MSP and then you'll also have RoundPoint and Two Harbors that have come together and have consolidated their loans on MSP. So when you see that type of M&A activity on the servicing side, it's been pretty much a net-net. If you look across our overall mortgage segment and just looking at the flat performance that we had last year in terms of recurring revenue and the guide Warren gave this year. Underneath that I think it's important that we are very confident that based on the sales success and the low attrition that we have had that we are clearly gaining share against both proprietary systems, as well as third-party peers during this tremendous decline in market volumes which in particular is on the origination side of the house. And I'd be \u2013 it's important to highlight as well that 2023 was a generational low in terms of mortgage transaction volumes. So we went back to data that we see as far back to 1991 to find a year that was as bad and it was actually 1991 that was even close and even that year was better. So to us, markets revert to a mean and if you look at the average from 1991 to 2023, the average is around 10 million loans, the mean was around 8, I think we put a conservative band around that 7 to 10 million loans given the market share gains that we've had. The significant customers that we are winning and implementing. We believe this platform is springloaded for growth as we turn the corner. Thanks, Simon. In terms of composite estimates that are out there, so if you look at the industry bodies that put out industry volume estimates, the market was approximately down 11%, what our modeling shows and if you take a composite of the industry analyst that's above where it is. I think in terms of couple data points I can share as I said, there is no question in our mind that we are gaining share in terms of against both proprietary platforms and third-party platforms and a lot of those clients because they are significant in size or in the implementation phase. So the benefits we'll get from recurring revenues will take some time as we implement those clients. The other benefit that we get when those clients are implemented is that those are new loans on our platform that will get per closed transaction fees on and those loans will also interact with hundreds of third-party service providers we have on our network. So when you are ordering a credit report for example, we get a fee for the efficiency that we provide on ordering those services on our networks. So those are additional transaction revenues that we would also benefit from in that case. The other thing that I'd say is that if you look at closed loans on our platform as we look at the closed loans that we saw on our platform were roughly mid-digit percentage points ahead of where the composite estimates are which further is evidence that we are gaining share and springloading this platform for when market volumes stabilize and Warren gave that range of couple hundred million to a half a billion in his comments just a minute ago. So I think that helps to frame when we say that the business is springloaded what that actually means. Hey, Ken. It's Ben. Thanks for the question. So I'll start on TTF. So, TTF, a lot of that volume is now on exchange and has transitioned over 10 plus years that we've seen that transition happening. I think the next step in the evolution of TTF that we see and I alluded to this in my prepared remarks is that, this is becoming and really has become the global benchmark for natural gas around the world. And it's being more and more as a proxy for, when you are trading LNG and that's seeing shifts around the world, which you can underestimate and you follow these markets very closely, you can underestimate the impact of the liberalization of natural gas has had to really creating a global natural gas market. It's no longer subject to being secular pipeline infrastructure and storages. It can be freely transported around the world. And that is where we are seeing the growth in the TTF contracts and that's why we constantly point out we are seeing new records, double-digit growth in terms of market participants, significant double-digit growth in terms of data subscriptions in TTF. TTF is up 100% in open interest year-over-year, 45% in ADV this year as more and more clients as they are looking at global issues around the movement of LNG out of the US going into Europe. They need to think about longer term implications of the White House recently announcing pauses on new LNG exports going out. US LNG heading east bound that goes through the Red Sea and Jeff alluded to it in his comments impacts that the attacks in the Red Sea it had on shipping there. US LNG going out of the Gulf going to Asia and when it's going west bound has to go through the Panama Canal that same unbelievable drought conditions impacting that. These are all risks that people need to manage and it's the TTF contract that we are now doing that with. So we see a lot of growth in that as that continues to evolve to be a global benchmark similar to what Brent is clearly today.  On WTI, really it goes to the a lot of the investments we have made in the innovation we've made in the oil market around that HOU contracts which is Midland WTI basis Houston, a physically delivered contract that we launched a couple of years back that's been growing significantly, which is pricing WTI oil basis Houston, that's going into the Atlantic basin and a lot of that being delivered into Europe. People that hedge and trade in those markets are trading those off the cornerstone of Brent are also using our HOU contract and then as a package that also trade WTI and for the efficiencies that they get trading in those Brent markets across those three contracts. We are seeing more and more of that trading volume moving to our exchange. So that's on the second part of your question around WTI. That's what we see is driving a lot of that growth in market share. Yeah, sure Ben. So, yeah, look, I think it's a testament to the organization in the sense that we were very well prepared for this deal to close and we really hit the ground running. And so, not only is a testament to the ability for us to kind of get all of our ducks in a row, but also just flexing the muscle that I think we've shown over the last number of years that integrations like this it's definitely a skill set of ours. So, I think to some extent it's very much a testament to do those two things in terms of us being a little bit better than we initially spoke to when we announced the deal around our Year One synergies. So, look, it does certainly make us feel comfortable about getting to our target of $200 million by the end of year five having coming in as strongly as we are right out of the gates here. But as we move through this year, I think we will take the opportunity to see how that unfolds and if there is any clarity on that and if there is potential to increase those, we'll certainly let you know. But right now, look we are five months into the same things are going very well and we are really just making progress towards those targets."

            "name": "Jeffrey Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. 2023 was a unique year for the energy markets. The year kicked off with a European ban on the import of Russian crude oil and a $60 Russian oil price cap imposed by the US, Japan, Canada and Australia, all driven by the Ukrainian conflict and a forced realignment of the global energy supply chain. In October, painful conflict with Israel erupted that is testing relationships within the energy producing Middle East and which caused the US house of representatives to send the bill to the US senate imposing further sanctions on Iranian oil.  In November, terrorists began attacking ships navigating the Red Sea, causing the world's largest operators of crude oil tankers to modify their supply chain operations out of their region. And throughout 2023 OPEC+ met the set quotas to cut oil production attempting to drive oil prices higher for the benefit of Russia and Middle East producers.  With this complex geopolitical backdrop, it would be reasonable to assume that we ended 2023 with oil prices pushing towards record highs. Well, that's not the case. Brent crude oil actually ended the year with prices lower than where the year started marking the first annual price decline since the COVID collapse.  Even the recent supply shocks in oil shipped from the Red Sea failed to rally oil prices for more than a day or two. When we acquired the former International Petroleum Exchange of London in the early 2000s its flagship product was a small futures contract on or then not well-known of oil called Brents. The Brent oil field consisted of four deepwater oil platforms built in the 1970s in the middle of the North Sea between Scotland and Norway.  The waters there are deep and the working environment is hostel. So pipelines were built to move the oil to the remote Shetland Islands where Brent was then loaded directly onto seaborne oil tankers. One of the early challenges that ICE faced trying to grow the trading volumes of this Brent futures contract on our newly acquired exchange was the substantial underlying issue that the Brent oilfields were drying up and oil production was deteriorating.  We began working with the oil industry and drove a consensus to allow other grades of oil from locations away from the Brent oilfields to make their way into a newly reconstituted ICE index which we continued to call Brent. Over time, we've evolved the index and we've added oil from fields of Forties, Oseberg Ekofisk, Troll and most recently, we added US Oil drilled in the Midland basis of West Texas.  The pipeline rail and trucking infrastructure serving the Midland basin drives a large portion of this US oil towards the Gulf of Mexico, where it becomes available for seaborne exports. And the US Oil drillers in this region have been very sensitive to global supply and demand price signals. Their market-based responses have caused their US oil exports to set the marginal price of the ICE Brent index roughly half the time since its latest reconstitution with other global oil grades setting the marginal price for the balance.  The Brent oilfield began decommissioning in 2006 and its first drilling platform seized production in 2011, followed by the second and third platforms stopping in 2014 and 2021. The fourth and final Brent platform has been repurposed to tap into another oilfield. So, today, it's safe to say that there is no longer any Brent in ICE's Brent index.  During our index evolution ICE marketed the value of the Brent index to the energy industry at the preferred way to hedge global energy prices. US oil exporters are now leveling out the prices for global crude oil and that's reflected in the Brent index making the difficult geopolitical shock that I just highlighted less impactful on global oil prices.  The record volume that ICE sees in our Brent oil futures trading complex is a direct result of this focused evolution of our ICE Brent index. I tell this story as an example of how we think about the industries in which we operate. We invest in and constantly work with market participants to transform industries to reflect changing environments. We are following a similar roadmap with our entire energy complex given the analogous macro backdrop of industrialized economies that are attempting to move away from carbon-emitting fuels causing us to list over a 1,000 commodity contracts versus just four contracts when we acquired the IPE. You may have seen our recent announcement that ICE is working with the US Department of Energy to develop regional markets for hydrogen fuels as we continue to focus on medium to long-term cyclical trends and the next energy frontier. Similarly, by creating our ICE Data Services division nearly nine years ago, we spotted the trend that the single most important asset associated with automation was trusted, mission-critical data and digitized information.  We've invested in information acquisition, data dissemination and index construction and you are witnessing our data services division extending the same playbook that we ran on Brent to transform global benchmarks for financial products in areas such as credit and interest rates. And these are increasingly making their way on the platforms around the globe including our own in the form of valuations, reference data, cash markets, derivative markets, ETFs, options and equities.  Importantly, we are leaning into this blueprint to drive ICE's most recent expansion with a goal to expand participation, facilitate information transparency and spot index creation in the US consumer interest rate markets as we move the industry with the SaaS model on a widely distributed network. A blueprint that captures proprietary data and information that we can organize and disseminate to help our customers make better financial decisions in a world where automation and generative models are key to enabling future efficient workflows.  In that vein and shifting to our strong results, 2023 marked our 18th consecutive year of record revenues, record operating income and record adjusted earnings per share, a record every year that we've been a public company. This record of growth reflects the quality of our strategy to diversify the business and position the company at the center of some of the largest industries undergoing analog to digital conversions, a strategy that's made ICE an all weather name which through an array of macroeconomic environments continues to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our stockholders. As we look to 2024 and beyond, we are in a better position than ever to capitalize on secular and cyclical trends that occur across asset classes and we've remained focused on investing and executing on many growth opportunities in front of us.  I'd like to conclude these prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their business and for their trust in 2023 and I want to thank my colleagues for their contributions to the best year in our company's history.  And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our operator Charlie and we'll conduct a question and answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time. Well, thank you, Charlie for managing the call for us this morning. Before we leave, I wanted to mention that every quarter for the last ten years before and after these earnings announcements, we receive a call and input from a shareholder named Jack Willins. And we didn't hear from Jack this week. So we did some outreach and learned that he had recently passed at age 88 and I just wanted to acknowledge the fact that his family and friends and colleagues that we also miss hearing from him.  And we are going to go back to work after this call to continue to build this all weather business model and that's what he would have wanted us to do. And so today, we will do it in his honor. Thank you."

There will be opportunity for questions at the end of the presentation. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to your host, Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations to begin. Please go ahead.\nKatia Gonzalez: Good morning. ICE's third quarter 2023 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2022 Form 10-K, third quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in our earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was a record, totaling $1.46, up 11% year-over-year. Net revenues totaled $2 billion and on a pro forma basis, increased 4% versus last year, driven by double-digit growth in our Exchange segment which was led by 22% growth in our futures platform. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $812 million, including $56 million related to Black Knight and $756 million related to legacy ICE, which was $4 million below the - of our original guidance range, largely driven by lower technology spend, including reduced cloud exposure as we continue to optimize and drive efficiency through our data center footprint. As we move into the fourth quarter, we expected adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $955 million to $965 million, with the increase relative to the third quarter, driven by additional rent, D&A and seasonality and capitalized labor as well as a full quarter of expense related to Black Knight. Moving below the line. Adjusted nonoperating expense totaled $114 million, including $41 million of incremental interest expense related to our acquisition of Black Knight. We expect adjusted nonoperating expense in the fourth quarter to between $225 million and $230 million, largely driven by the full core impact of acquisition-related interest expense. It is also worth noting that we have reduced our term loan and CP outstanding by around $700 million since transaction closed in early September. Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter net revenues totaled $1.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $754 million were up 13%, driven by 42% growth in our energy revenues. This strong performance included 48% growth in global natural gas driven by a record quarter of TTF volumes. In addition, we continue to see robust trends across our global oil business with ADV up 40% year-over-year in the third quarter and open interest at the end of October, up 26% year-over-year. As we look to the fourth quarter, it's worth noting that we expect OTC and other revenue to be in the range of $70 million to $75 million, with the third quarter benefiting from a few items that we don't anticipate will repeat. In addition, and in light of the strong performance in our equity options business, where revenues are up 15% year-to-date, we've elected to a regulatory fee holiday, which will temporarily reduce OTC and other revenues by $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter. Shifting away from transaction revenues. Recurring revenues increased by 4% year-over-year, including 8% growth in Exchange data services. which is once again driven by double-digit growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data as well as a benefit of a few million dollars related to audit recoveries, which we don't expect will repeat in the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by our listings business where growth in annual listing fees was offset by the rolling off of initial listings fees related to the strong IPO market in 2021. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled $559 million, up 4% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 6%, including 9% growth in ICE bonds and 5% growth in our CDS clearing business. Excluding the impact of the Euronext migration, both recurring revenues and ASV grew by 4%, driven by strong growth across our desktop, feeds and derivative analytics offerings. Within our desktop business, revenues once again grew double digits as we continue to see strong demand from energy and environmental-focused customers as well as the continued robust growth in our ICE chat offering in part driven by growing adoption of large language models. In our consolidated feeds business, we once again grew high single digits and expect to exceed $100 million of revenue for the full year as we continue to realize the benefits of past investments to enhance our platform. In our fixed income, data and analytics business, we generated a record $279 million in the third quarter with sequential growth in revenue driven by our North American pricing and reference data business or PRD. While PRD growth may continue to be below trend in the near term, we're seeing signs of an improved sales cycle alongside strong retention. Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Third quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $330 million, including $87 million related to Black Knight. Recurring revenues totaled $235 million and on a pro forma basis, $396 million, representing nearly 80% of total pro forma segment revenues. Despite the headwinds facing the mortgage industry and the related near-term pressure on our recurring revenues, sales continued to be robust as customers look to reshape and modernize how they do business. Through October, we have already surpassed our prior full year record for new Encompass sales, which was set in 2020. In our servicing solutions business, the closing of the Black Knight transaction has unlocked the pipeline with four new MSP customers signed October alone, including a top 25 servicer, Fifth Bank. This compares to a total of five signings through the first nine months of the year and has quickly put 2023 on track to be the second best year for MSP sales since 2017. In addition, as we look to 2024 and continuing the momentum, we have seen post close, the current pipeline for MSP is at its highest level in five years. While we expect the secular trend of customers seeking greater efficiency across their workflows to continue, it's important to note that these strong sales results will take time to implement. And looking to the fourth quarter, we anticipate near-term cyclical headwinds will persist, coupled with typical seasonal pressures on origination volumes in the first and fourth quarters of each year, we expect the total fourth quarter IMT revenues will be in the range of $490 million to $500 million, bringing full year pro forma - revenues to approximately $2.06 billion and in the middle of the guidance range we provided on our Black Knight closing call in late September. In summary, at a consolidated ICE level, we once again grew revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. And as we look to the end of the year and into 2024, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and to create value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. For now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. I would like to first welcome the Black Knight team to their first ICE earnings call. While it has been less than two months since we closed on the acquisition in early September, we've been very impressed by the collaboration between our teams during this short time, a testament to the talent of our respective employee populations and our shared entrepreneurial cultures. Similar to our exchanges and fixed income businesses, Black Knight integrated into our ICE Mortgage Technology network, a network that thrives by offering a value proposition that aligns growth with efficiency gains that we bring to our customers. As we have seen across our network in futures and fixed income, these efficiency gains are best achieved through harnessing unstructured data to create mission-critical information, seamlessly linking participants to that information and ensuring that the network technology underpinning are of the highest quality and security. It is the execution of this value proposition that often propels an analog to digital conversion of an industry, and it is a blueprint we've applied across all our businesses. A number of years ago, we saw the importance of investing in an energy platform that is truly global, one that better serves the needs of an evolving and growing commercial customer base. Today, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers are not only seeking liquidity in the major gold benchmarks, but also in products that provide for greater hedging pursuit. Our global oil complex spans over 700 products, including locational spreads, product spreads and refining spreads. These products are built off of our benchmark contracts, such as Brent crude oil and gas oil. Driven by the breadth of our commercial customer base, we have become the natural home for liquidity in these products with open interest in our oil complex up 26% year-over-year through the end of October, including a 28% increase in our other crude and refined products. In our natural gas markets, we began investing in the globalization of these markets over a decade ago. Today, our European TTF and Asian JKM gas complexes continue to grow and reach important milestones as they evolve into global gas benchmarks. In the third quarter, the number of participants in each market grew double digits year-over-year and TTF reached another quarter of record volumes. This strong performance helped drive record revenues across our natural gas complex through the first nine months of 2023, up 37% year-over-year. In addition - interest trends for TTF and JKM remained strong through October, up 58% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. This strength continues to underscore the significance of our contracts to the price formation of global natural gas. We are well positioned to both benefit from the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets because we operate a global gas market with benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia. In our environmental markets, we recognize the importance of carbon price transparency over 10 years ago by acquiring the Climate Exchange in 2010 and building around those leading markets to develop a global environmental business. As we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is illustrated by continued growth in active market participants, up 9% year-over-year. Importantly, because we offer one of the broadest suites of environmental products across the carbon cycle, we remain excited about our position to serve customers as they navigate the journey to clean energy and as the demand for transparent pricing in carbon grows. In summary, these cleaner energy sources combined, including global natural gas and environmental make up over 40% of our energy revenues today and have grown 17% on average over the past five years, including a 30% growth year-to-date. As the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmentals, alongside our gas and oil complexes, will provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to manage these evolving risks. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. As fixed income markets electronify and passive investing grows, our comprehensive all-weather platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth, up 7% year-to-date. Investments we've made to enhance content and functionality across our other data and network services business continue to pay dividends. Year-to-date, this part of our business is up 7%, driven by strength across our desktop, derivatives analytics and feed offerings as customers continue to modernize workflows. Within our desktops business, the investments we have made to reduce friction across the workflow have contributed to double-digit revenue growth year-to-date, along with double-digit growth in the number of users that connect to our ICE Chat platform. Similarly, within our consolidated feeds business, investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering have led to accelerating adoption by large financial institutions. This has directly contributed to high single-digit growth in this area year-to-date. In addition, we continue to see strength in our index business driven by double-digit growth in ETF assets under management as of the end of the third quarter, with now over $0.5 trillion in assets selecting ICE indices as the passive benchmark. As we move forward, we will continue to build on our track record of adding efficiencies and bringing transparency to opaque asset classes, leveraging our mission-critical data assets and market-leading technology. Turning now to our mortgage business. Like what we saw in the commodity markets 20 years ago, there's an analog to digital conversion occurring in the U.S. residential mortgage industry. Critical to our ability to execute on this opportunity is our network, one that in combination with Black Knight, spans from consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary market. In the third quarter, our mortgage business once again outperformed the broader industry that experienced a nearly 20% decline in origination volumes. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. And during the third quarter, of the Encompass customers that came up for renewal, roughly 60% increase their base subscriptions. Importantly, where customers decline in subscriptions, the trade-off is a higher per closed loan fee, which will provide an uplift in transaction revenues when the market returns. In addition, part of our thesis has been at clients that have origination businesses, combined with servicing businesses, we want to bring together a complete front-to-back experience for their clients through one trusted platform provider. As mentioned last quarter, JPMorgan Chase has selected Encompass for their loan origination system across all channels and has implemented or is implementing our data and document automation platform. These wins are on top of a long-standing, great relationship with MSP for servicing, which now positions us to provide a platform to help facilitate their front-to-back experience for their clients. And since we closed on Black Knight, I am pleased to share two new wins along the same lines. First, M&T Bank has now selected Encompass to replace their existing loan origination platform and has added our data and document automation platform on top of the existing MSP relationship for servicing, again, positioning us to provide our platform to support the front-to-back experience for their clients. The second new win is with Fifth Third Bank. We have cross-sold MSP and several data and analytics products to Fifth Third Bank, an existing IMT customer, our consumer engagement solutions and all regs product. In summary, these are major wins for us and serve as a validation of our vision with large clients bringing together a complete front-to-back experience for their clients through one trusted platform provider. The relationships with these great customers are models we plan to replicate with many more. Increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. This trend gives us confidence that we can grow the business that today is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Please now turn to Slide 9. The idea to start ICE came in the late 1990s, an idea to take advantage of the move of commerce to the Internet and an idea to capitalize on changing government regulations regarding energy procurement. The subsequent dot-com crash and the collapse of Enron created a very difficult business environment, particularly the trading of energy. But it was in this challenging environment where ICE was able to gain a toehold into the market and build the foundation for a growing business in commodity trading, a business that, as you've just heard, continues to flourish more than 20 years later. Sometime around 2006, we came across a newspaper article about credit default swaps and the difficulty that this market was having settling such contracts. We became convinced that ICE could build a clearinghouse infrastructure that could solve these delivery problems. Our colleagues took up the challenge and we acquired targeted platforms and talent. Two years later, when the financial crisis of 2008 froze the CDS markets, we were in a position to offer a sustainable solution. And when the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and the European Market Infrastructure Act of 2012 required the use of clearinghouses in the over-the-counter swaps markets, ICE was able to expand what has now become another significant business for us. I tell you these stories not as some kind of victory lap, but to remind you of our repeated experience that the best time to lay the groundwork for a strong future is when your target customers are experiencing stress and are open to new vendors and new platforms to alleviate their problems. I also remind you that evolutions in regulation in the financial services industry typically follow periods of economic change and that standardized, open and transparent platforms, such as those that ICE operates, can benefit. A1nd ultimately, I call your attention to our history to answer a question that we've been asked, why is ICE investing in a consumer finance technology platform via the mortgage market? And why do it now? We spoke on our recent call following the closing of our acquisition of Black Knight about our aim to build financial market infrastructure across the company that can offer earnings and dividend growth in variable market conditions, all weather growth that will allow our shareholders to have confidence that they won't have to time their investments into and out of - an episodic earnings stream. There are currently many stress points across large portions of the U.S. mortgage industry and ICE is experiencing an openness from market participants and its regulators to consider new solutions delivered by our comprehensive technology platform. This is why Warren and Ben were able to tell you in specifics about the encouraging reception that we're receiving for our vision to rewire the mortgage market. And why Ben shared our success with platform clients like JPMorgan Chase, M&T Bank and Fifth Third Bank, all of whom are significant sophisticated drivers of the market. The same economic stress that exists in the current U.S. mortgage market is, in converse, fueling growth on our commodity hedging and credit protection platforms, which benefited ICE's record third quarter earnings. We're positioning ourselves to transform the U.S. mortgage market while it is under stress with a goal to create opportunities to springload our future growth and contribute to our all-weather earnings and dividend growth road map. Another topic that we're being asked about a lot is our adoption of large language models and learning algorithms. ICE has long been investing in adaptive learning tools beginning more than a decade ago when we incorporated learning tools into our growing ICE Chat system as a way of automating workflows based on unstructured trader and back-office conversations. We're also - we've been deploying learning models in our compliance effort to recognize trading and use patterns that deviate from norms. Ben mentioned, our ICE Mortgage Technology product, now called Data and Document Automation, which is an extension of the learning model that we acquired within Ellie Mae. This product recognizes a wide variety of documents that end up in a consumer file when underwriting a loan, documents such as pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements and alike, which the algorithm automatically identifies and places in appropriate digital folders. The model extracts key structured and unstructured data elements from these folders for further validation by a credit team via a workflow that detects exception cases for the compliance team. Our model is based on a transparent rules engine, which we believe will assist our customers and their regulators to comply with the President's recent private letter ruling on model fairness, integrity. And our model is being further extended by us across our expanding mortgage platform. Our experience in building and deploying these learning models also facilitates our research into the cost of computation that is associated with model queries, and it permits us to have a thoughtful understanding of the cost benefit analysis of their deployment and the model's extension. When we acquired the New York Stock Exchange, it was built on a technology stack that was overly complicated, hard to manage and unreliable. So we set off to completely rebuild the underlying architecture with modern technology. Given the importance of the New York Stock Exchange to the global economy, we had to rebuild the exchange while it was in daily use. And its extensive connectivity to the global financial services industry demanded that we not ask our customers to invest in making changes on their side of the firewall. So, we wrap the old technology with a modern front end and methodically rebuilt and replaced all of the back-end hardware and software. This process took us years to execute with our successful final software rollout just a few days ago, deprecating the last of its seven unique legacy matching engines. Our upgrade blueprint worked. And today, the New York Stock Exchange sits atop one of the most powerful, deterministic performance and resilient tech stacks in the world. This same plan to build a new bridge while the cars continue to drive across it was deployed by us when we acquired Interactive Data Corporation. There, we inherited over 100 legacy servers, many of which literally could not be shut down for fear of not being able to properly restart them. We, again, replaced this mess with a modern data superstore over a period of six years and without sacrifice from our customer base. When we made our initial investment in MERS, its technology was outsourced, and was not able to keep up with the demands placed on it during the financial crisis. Our business deal with MERS ownership consortium was to rebuild the platform within two years. If successful, we had an option to buy and run the company. We did just that. And MERS is now a cornerstone to our broad US mortgage industry platform. With our acquisition of Black Knight, we've again undertaken a blueprint to wrap its legacy technologies, tie it to our mortgage platform for near seamless integration with our customer base and rebuild its tech stack with a modern architecture over the coming years. As I've mentioned on past calls, ICE is agnostic to cloud providers, but we also operate our own proprietary cloud with ICE data centers having connectivity to a vast portion of the global financial services industry. This allows us to oversee our costs and stand behind our performance, a cloud strategy that Warren mentioned was a contributor to our record earnings in the quarter. In summary, my comments today highlight three backdrops that ICE follows to evolve our all-weather business model. We invest in environments that may have fallen out of favor and at times when customers need us the most. We embrace regulatory shifts and the workflow alterations that inevitably follow periods of economic change. And we embraced an experiment with new technologies, while enhancing technology assets that we may acquire to drive platform efficiencies and better serve our customers. Shifting now to ICE's strong results. Please turn to Slide 10. In the third quarter, we delivered the best quarter in our company's history with record revenues, record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. We have intentionally positioned our company to provide customer solutions in numerous geographies and economic conditions to facilitate all weather results. These record-setting third quarter results against our extraordinary third quarter results of last year are another example of strong execution across our platform. And I'd like to end our prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their continued business and their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to our best ever quarterly results following up on our unsurpassed results of the first half. And with that, I'll now turn our call back to our moderator, Lauren, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ken Worthington from JPMorgan. Ken, please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about ICE oil. So you mentioned last quarter that Midland was added to Brent, and we've seen trading of Brent - I'm sorry, trading at Midland take off. I'm curious how you think Midland is impacting the trading of Brent? And to what extent Midland is a contributor to ICE's increased share in WTI? And then I guess, most importantly, how much of the benefit to ICE is left as we look forward? Or has the positive impact already played out?\nBenjamin Jackson: Hi, Ken. It's Ben. Thank you for the question. We see all the investments that we've been doing in our oil platform as a truly global platform that's all complementary to one another. As the clear trend around the world has been under investment in energy infrastructure, so you have a lot of volatility in energy when there's any kind of supply shocks. You've got electronification continuing to take hold. You have energy markets that are truly global. You got supply chains that are evolving and changing and people are looking for more precision and risk management. So with all the investments that we've been making in our global oil platform, we take all that into account, we're engaging with customers now more than ever, and we're getting feedback that there's a need for more precise instruments, pricing Middle East oil that's destined for China. That's what created that Murban contract and ICE futures Abu Dhabi, and it's grown nicely. In parallel to that, Brent, which is the centerpiece of that entire complex is up both in OI and volume year-over-year. So we see them as complementary trading assets that run side by side. We also continue to see investments like our HOU contract in the U.S., which is pricing Midland barrels coming out of Midland, going into Houston and then eventually making its way into our dated Brent contract. We're seeing that contract also continue to grow. So we see these all as very complementary assets to one another. And even within the Middle East itself, you look at our Dubai contract. That contract is up in volumes 80% year-over-year, with OI up close to 50% year-over-year. So we, again, see them all as very complementary assets that traders look at both for the precision that, that particular instrument provides, but then also trading them in parallel to the other benchmark contracts.\nKen Worthington: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Budish from Barclays. Ben, please go ahead.\nBen Budish: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow-up on some of the commentary around the wins in the mortgage business. Just to what degree do you think that some of the MSP wins and some of the cross-selling, is that a result of things ICE is doing differently since acquiring the asset? To what degree is it perhaps pent-up demand, things were maybe stalling while the merger was pending? And if that's the case, what do you think about the pipeline? How sustainable is that growth versus perhaps a compression of some built up - or some pent-up demand over the last many months? Thank you.\nBenjamin Jackson: Yes. Thank you for the question. And as we've said in a number of calls, our hypothesis has been that the combination of these businesses will create, for the first time, an opportunity for our clients to have one d1 trusted platform provider for that complete front-to-back experience for their clients. And you heard a lot from in our prepared remarks about the sales success across our platform. And we believe that based on that success as well as the funnel we see ahead of us, that we have a platform that's really spring loaded as the market normalizes as loans are growing. And just unpacking some more detail what's going on under the cover. So we mentioned we had a solid Q3 in Encompass sales in the third quarter and then also in October. And as Warren pointed out in his prepared remarks, we've had a record sales year and we still have a couple of months to go in the year. So that's playing out very well for us. As we mentioned, we won M&T Bank, that's already an existing MSP customer. They're adding both Encompass and our DDA platform. We've won TriPoint that's moving to Encompass. And then we've also had an expansion with a client called The Federal Savings Bank, adding our data and document automation platform on top of the existing Encompass relationship. There's - switching to MSP. There's no doubt that there was some pent-up demand on MSP as there was an overhang on the deal with clients waiting to see how it was going to come through. And now we're seeing a number of deals that have come through. We mentioned Fifth Third Bank replacing their existing platform provider. They're also adding a number of data products as part of that deal as well. We've also added Black Hills Federal Credit Union, which is an existing Encompass client, has now added as I look at it, is incredibly strong. And - but as Warren also commented in his prepared remarks, this is core infrastructure that's going into these clients, and it does take time for them to implement across both MSP as well as on the loan origination side. You've got a six to 18-month window to implement these clients. But then once implemented, we're getting new loans under our platform and on our network. So the final thing I'd point out is we're also not losing customers. We're not losing significant customers on the platform. And that's why I used the comment that we're spring-loaded because as we see the market environment is going to normalize at some point in time, the loan growth that we've had in our platform positions us very well to achieve those long-term objectives of the growth criteria that we've outlined.\nBen Budish: Great. Thanks for all the incremental color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Dan, please go ahead. \nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. Questions on the fixed income data. I think, Warren, you mentioned improved sales cycles. Was hoping you could expand upon that. And then also, as you think about next year, and pricing, how we might think about - or what has been the typical price that you've raised or the percentage increase and maybe how that might be different in this type of inflationary environment?\nWarren Gardiner: Hi, It's Warren. So I'll talk a little bit about the pricing, and I'm going to hand it over to Lynn to talk about some of the color on what we're seeing on the fixed income data analytics side. So on the pricing side, we - it would have been a couple of years now that we talked about a third or so of the growth we felt like would come from pricing. I'd say that, look, it will move around each year, so it's not necessarily perfectly consistent in that way. But certainly, as you look over the last number of years that we've had the IDC asset, it's been pretty much in that range. And so as we're thinking towards next year, I think it's fair to be thinking that will continue. And it's underpinned by the philosophy you've heard us articulate a number of times on these calls and that we really just look to capture value when we bring it to our customers. And that's really what we're doing when we think about price within the fixed income and data analytics business and really across the platform. So we're going to continue to do that in that business, similar to what we have over the last couple of years.\nLynn Martin: Yes. And it's Lynn. I'll just chime in with some color of what we're seeing. As we said on previous calls, this segment, in particular, really shows the all-weather nature of ICE. And if you look at the execution side of the business, ICE bonds, in particular, had really strong growth over the last quarter, particularly given the muted volatility in the muni markets where we've been able to continue to increase our adoption by the retail and wealth side of the businesses as well as benefit from the increased adoption by institutional users contributing to share gains in all of our different products. Now bringing that through to the fixed income data and analytics side of the business, as we've continued to interact with the front office customers, we've seen continued increasing demand for our front office tools. So while small contributors to the overall bottom line, products like CEP, best execution that we've talked about in the past, there continues to be strong demand for those products as fixed income markets continue to electronify. You've seen that manifest itself in a shortening sales cycle, which has been a - which has really benefited us in terms of the pipeline contribution, the pipeline conversion rates in the short term. Additionally, as we've continued to see money flow into fixed income ETFs, as is evidenced by 30% growth year-on-year at the end of Q3 into our index AUM, we've continued to see that manifest itself in terms of demand for the data, demand for our indices, demand for services around our indices. So we continue to be optimistic that we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on the trend of fixed income electronification and the optimization of workflows in fixed income.\nDan Fannon: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Kyle, please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning. So there have been some headlines over the past couple of days around the NAR lawsuit being decided in favor of the plaintiffs. And there's some pressure around what that means down the road for the number of buy side real estate agents needed to serve that US mortgage market and the percentage of home sales that will even have a buy-side agent involved in a transaction. I believe buy-side agents are the largest referral pipeline of deal flow for loan officers, which are core Encompass clients. I guess if we see less buy-side agents being used in the market, and loan officers lose their largest referral pipeline, I guess do you foresee any material share shifts for who is originating loans within the mortgage ecosystem? And if so, how do you believe that could impact Encompass, if at all?\nBenjamin Jackson: Hi, Kyle. This is Ben. It actually - those types of trends play into our overall thesis and hypothesis in this space is that there is opportunity to create more efficiency around the transactions. For us, we're neutral in that space. We don't have a business of selling leads to real estate brokers and the like. For us, our core businesses are all in and around the origination transaction itself, making sure that we're matching the client to the ideal product that meets their needs at the lowest cost to improve access to homeownership as well as clients that have an existing home, identifying based on data and analytics the best product to cross-sell to that client, the best time for clients to have a servicing book as well as an origination book. So when we talk about that whole front-to-back offering, that's really our sweet spot. So we don't see an impact to us negative. If anything, all of the data and analytics offerings that we have that underpin this overall platform front to back, both between ICE Mortgage Technology assets that we've had historically as well as the data assets that have come with the Black Knight business, all position us very well in that space going forward.\nKyle Voigt: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Alex, please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hi. Good morning. Thank you for the question. I was hoping we can maybe build a little bit more specificity around the fixed income data and analytics business. If we look at the revenue trends that obviously been sort of challenged here, we know the reasons why around the sales cycle and pricing pressure on fixed income assets. But if you look at the ASV, it's been kind of flat for the last couple of quarters. So maybe just kind of help contextualize what does the improvement sales pipeline and shortening cease mean for revenue growth over the near term, maybe early thoughts into '24?\nLynn Martin: Yes, Alex, this is Lynn. Thanks so much for the question. So if you look at the Fixed Income and Data Services segment as a whole, I talked about some of the all-weather nature that attributed really to the fixed income data and analytics line and the executions line in just a bit ago. But the one area that we've continued to see as a really strong contributor to the bottom line, top line is the other data services business and the acceleration of that business throughout the year. And that's really been fueled by a couple of different areas. Number one is our multiyear investment and the modernization of the tech stack associated with our distribution platforms. And on the macro side, is the continued strong demand for our products and services fueled by the broader adoption of automation across the industry in a variety of different areas, which feels like we're still in the early stages of. So we're seeing the confluence of these items benefit the top line growth in this area, and that causes us to be optimistic for continued growth in this area, in particular, for the medium term. We've been very deliberate, as Jeff mentioned on his call to be cloud agnostic and really invest in our own data centers. One of the reasons that we did that was really in response to customer demand as increased automation tends to be a data-heavy area as well as fueling demand for things such as data center space and customers asking us to grow their data center footprint. As a result, and what we've seen more recently, our connectivity sales in Q3 were the second highest in our history. Now those are going to take some time to implement, obviously, before we see the benefits of that in terms of revenue. And our desktop sales last quarter matched our historical high. So we continue to be optimistic that the trends are going to be positive for this area given the pipeline that we have in this area and given the more recent sales that we've been able to achieve. On our feeds business, which we talked a little bit about in our prepared remarks, we benefit from the automation trend as workflows continue to become more automated and customers continue to value the modernization efforts we've undertaken to streamline our technology. So we've been able to attain a variety of new [logos] more recently and then also benefit from historical Tier 1 logos and their increased adoption of our services. And then finally, the area that continues to drive growth in this area, and we think it's the early stages, is the adoption of our large language model, our proprietary large language models in our chat platform. Our chat user growth is up 13% year-to-date, and the increased usage in the models has driven not only revenue benefits here, but also activity generated within our energy markets which activity generated through large language models in our energy markets was up 90% quarter-on-quarter compared to last year and 70% year-to-date. So, there's a variety of trends that we see as tailwinds for this line, in particular, to continue to drive compound and growth for the medium to long-term.\nAlex Blostein: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Brian, please go ahead.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks so much. Good morning folks. Maybe just to talk about the synergy - the revenue synergy targets for the Black Knight, the $125 million over five years. And then what you mentioned, Ben, on the Black Knight update call at the end of September, the $300 million of opportunity that you can see now. And then cross-referencing that with some of the examples you've already cited. Maybe if you can just reconcile the difference between those two numbers. And I realize there's still six to 18 month types of implementation time frames, so they take a while to get into the revenue stream. But it would seem like you're certainly on track to easily beat that $125 million ahead of time. So maybe just to talk about your outlook on revenue synergies over the next, say, couple of years?\nWarren Gardiner: Hi Brian, it's Warren. So, I think, yes, you throw out a couple of numbers there, all correct, of course. But when we think about those revenue synergies, I think the best way to be thinking about it is - and you pointed out one point that I think is important is it takes a little bit long for these to implement. But I think about it more the OpEx of it being more hockey stick like. And so I think in the early year you probably don't have as much, but that as we obviously move to the next couple of years and through year five, you're going to see those start to build. So, - and part of that is, look, we've got to integrate the companies and we start to get going on some of the areas that we've talked to out on not only the core products, but also on some of the data products that we want to cross-sell across the platform as well. And so that takes a little bit of time in addition to some of the implementation timelines we talked about as well. So, I think about it. Certainly, we're going to have some here. Ben talked about a number of wins that we've had. But again, there's going to be an implementation time line for those. But certainly, we are off to a very strong start there, and it's really encouraging in terms of us getting to those targets ultimately.\nBrian Bedell: Okay, fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Simon Clinch from Redburn Atlantic. Simon, please go ahead.\nSimon Clinch: Hi everyone. Thanks for taking my call. I was wondering if we could just drill down just to your comments about the mortgage market and the performance of the transaction side. I'm just curious to - I guess, how you're getting your market information on mortgage originations being down nearly 20%. We're hearing sort of different figures thrown around as well beyond that. So, I'm curious of how you build that number. And then ultimately, how are you thinking about what's going into that fourth quarter guide for the IMT pro forma revenues as well? Thanks.\nWarren Gardiner: Hi Simon. So, we generally look at the composite, the forecasters as you're aware of the NBA, Sandy and Freddie, and we're looking at those. We also have some other data around our loan volumes and, of course, MERS registrations that we all pulled together. And so that - your fair - it's a fair question to ask because, obviously, the forecasters are working with somewhat imperfect information, and you see revisions here and there at times too. So, - but that's generally what we saw. We did see in the quarter some Encompass closed loans down in the high teens. So, I think we did well versus the market. And so that's an encouraging sign, of course. There is, within those transaction revenues, which is what you might be referencing to some extent there, some other elements there. I mean, professional services fees are in there. Now, with Black Knight, we have default management revenues. You've got some MERS registrations that there's deferrals related to. So, there are some things in there that, of course, are not perfectly correlated with what's going on in the mortgage market over this current period, if you will, that will create some noise. But I think in terms of how we're performing within the closed loan component of that, it's been encouraging. And again, it's part of its adoption and new customers coming online at some of the sales we've had. And I think as you move into next year, and certainly based on what you heard from Ben, we continue to have success there. So, I think that, that will continue to drive that kind of an outcome.\nSimon Clinch: Thanks. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Craig, please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thanks. Good morning everyone. After the pricing adjustments in the energy complex earlier this year, we wanted to see if you had an update on the ability to adjust pricing in the future, both outside of the energy complex over the near-term and then longer term in the energy business. And we know this has not been a big focus for ICE in the past, but inflation is higher and a key competitive of yours has been more aggressive with pricing hikes.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks for the question, Craig, it's Warren. So that's something we're thinking about, I think, as I said on prior calls. And you're right, it's - the headline price changes are not something we had traditionally done. We have always gone into markets and injected market maker tiers and things - in incentive programs and things of that nature. But it's not something that we've done historically at the headline level. We did do it this year, and I think it's been relatively successful. We certainly are, as we move into our budget season here at the moment, thinking about what we might be able to do on that front. I think as we said previously, it's something that we will pick our spots on. I don't expect us to do it on the same products every year. But certainly, we have not done a lot on many other products across, not just energy, but other areas of futures. And so we'll be thoughtful about that. Again, it all comes back to us thinking about what kind of value we've created for the customer and pricing appropriately for that. And so as we think through that, you'll see some - potentially see some announces there. But I don't know that I'd expect it to be on the same products every single year. We'll - again, I think we'll pick our spots as we think through that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Michael, please go ahead.\nMichael Cyprys: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. We've seen regulators - banking regulators propose new capital rules for the banks, which could make some of their bespoke off exchange-driven products a bit more capital intensive. So, just curious if you're taking that where you guys see the biggest opportunity maybe to bring derivatives from OTC to the exchange-traded market, how you might quantify that? And just bigger picture, just given the capital proposals that can make certain products and businesses more capital intensive for the banks. I guess where do you see the biggest opportunities from that?\nJeff Sprecher: This is Jeff. Thanks for the question. I think it's a complicated environment because while the Basel rules are being discussed, every country that we do business in seems to be thinking about implementing them slightly differently, which sort of begs the question, will the market coalesce around a single standard? And who in that coalescing process has the influence to drive the consensus? And we don't really know yet. But you're right in that some of the proposals in the most draconian cases could be significant on banks. And we - if you step back and you just look at our business in a macro level, and I mentioned it even in the prepared remarks that I wrote that ICE believes in standardized, transparent, widely distributed, regulated businesses. And any regulatory or government action that pushes the market towards more transparency and more standardization is good for us. In some cases, I made the point - I tried to make the point in my prepared remarks that it's been my experience that whenever there's been an economic change, either an economic downturn or even an economic upturn as there's a transition to a different economic environment seems like regulators take a look and try to figure out what's different. And we have tended to benefit over the history of this company from those changes. It's partly why I say that we're not anti-regulation, and we are willing to adapt to regulation because I think the kind of way we do business is what ultimately regulators are looking for transparency and wide distribution and standardization. But yes, thank you for the question. We're thinking about it, I think the same way you phrased your question.\nMichael Cyprys: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question comes from Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Patrick, please go ahead.\nPatrick Moley: Good morning. I just had one last one on fixed income. I think last quarter, Lynn had mentioned that as issuance normalizes, you could see AUM reallocation, higher capture indices. I was just hoping to get an update on, from your perspective, what you're seeing there and your expectations going forward? And then just to add on to that, I'm wondering how we should think about the yield profile differences between treasuries and munis and the impact that could have on the business more broadly? Thanks.\nLynn Martin: Yes. Lynn, thanks for the question. In terms of the allocation of AUM, we have definitely seen an improvement - variety of equity indices, for example, although they're relatively small compared to our core fixed income indices where you've seen an uptick in the amount of AUM that had moved into them. Those being our biotech, semiconductor and some of our other more bespoke indices. In terms of the fixed income allocation, governments have continued to grow in terms of AUM, but you've also seen higher capture classes such as high-yield, which we're really well known for, investment grade and our unique indices gain some share as well. So it's a bit of everything growing in terms of AUM, but that has definitely slowed into some of our higher capture products, which has resulted in our index revenues growing nicely, particularly as compared with last year at this time. In terms of the yield profile, it's a really good question. You saw our core products such as munis have muted volatility during the summer months, not overly unexpected. You've seen volatility in those products start to spike up again as we enter the fall, and that's really a trend that's continued throughout October, in particular. Treasuries have also been a nice grower for us in terms of transactions. We've also seen growth though in things like CDs and our money market product CDs and then agencies as well. So as I mentioned earlier, we've really seen good growth across each of our different products. If you look at the amount of transactions on our platform in Q3 as compared with last year Q3, in fact, the amount of transactions are up 53%. So I think that really positions us nicely because of all the hard work the team has done to penetrate the wealth side of the business. Obviously, retail has been a good grower for us traditionally and all the hard work that the team has done over the last few years to really build our institutional footprint, which we continue to see expanding both in terms of activity and a number of participants on our platform. So I think we're really positioned nicely going into the more volatile time that we're in right now.\nOperator: Thank you. That is now the end of the Q&A session. So I'll now hand back over to Jeff Sprecher for closing remarks.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Thank you, Lauren, for managing the call, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me again thank my colleagues for delivering a record third quarter and definitely want to thank our customers for their continued business and their trust. We'll be updating you again soon as we continue to innovate around our all-weather business model and build solutions for our customers and generate growth on top of growth. So with that, I hope you all have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Jeffrey Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Please now turn to Slide 9. The idea to start ICE came in the late 1990s, an idea to take advantage of the move of commerce to the Internet and an idea to capitalize on changing government regulations regarding energy procurement. The subsequent dot-com crash and the collapse of Enron created a very difficult business environment, particularly the trading of energy. But it was in this challenging environment where ICE was able to gain a toehold into the market and build the foundation for a growing business in commodity trading, a business that, as you've just heard, continues to flourish more than 20 years later. Sometime around 2006, we came across a newspaper article about credit default swaps and the difficulty that this market was having settling such contracts. We became convinced that ICE could build a clearinghouse infrastructure that could solve these delivery problems. Our colleagues took up the challenge and we acquired targeted platforms and talent. Two years later, when the financial crisis of 2008 froze the CDS markets, we were in a position to offer a sustainable solution. And when the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 and the European Market Infrastructure Act of 2012 required the use of clearinghouses in the over-the-counter swaps markets, ICE was able to expand what has now become another significant business for us. I tell you these stories not as some kind of victory lap, but to remind you of our repeated experience that the best time to lay the groundwork for a strong future is when your target customers are experiencing stress and are open to new vendors and new platforms to alleviate their problems. I also remind you that evolutions in regulation in the financial services industry typically follow periods of economic change and that standardized, open and transparent platforms, such as those that ICE operates, can benefit. A1nd ultimately, I call your attention to our history to answer a question that we've been asked, why is ICE investing in a consumer finance technology platform via the mortgage market? And why do it now? We spoke on our recent call following the closing of our acquisition of Black Knight about our aim to build financial market infrastructure across the company that can offer earnings and dividend growth in variable market conditions, all weather growth that will allow our shareholders to have confidence that they won't have to time their investments into and out of - an episodic earnings stream. There are currently many stress points across large portions of the U.S. mortgage industry and ICE is experiencing an openness from market participants and its regulators to consider new solutions delivered by our comprehensive technology platform. This is why Warren and Ben were able to tell you in specifics about the encouraging reception that we're receiving for our vision to rewire the mortgage market. And why Ben shared our success with platform clients like JPMorgan Chase, M&T Bank and Fifth Third Bank, all of whom are significant sophisticated drivers of the market. The same economic stress that exists in the current U.S. mortgage market is, in converse, fueling growth on our commodity hedging and credit protection platforms, which benefited ICE's record third quarter earnings. We're positioning ourselves to transform the U.S. mortgage market while it is under stress with a goal to create opportunities to springload our future growth and contribute to our all-weather earnings and dividend growth road map. Another topic that we're being asked about a lot is our adoption of large language models and learning algorithms. ICE has long been investing in adaptive learning tools beginning more than a decade ago when we incorporated learning tools into our growing ICE Chat system as a way of automating workflows based on unstructured trader and back-office conversations. We're also - we've been deploying learning models in our compliance effort to recognize trading and use patterns that deviate from norms. Ben mentioned, our ICE Mortgage Technology product, now called Data and Document Automation, which is an extension of the learning model that we acquired within Ellie Mae. This product recognizes a wide variety of documents that end up in a consumer file when underwriting a loan, documents such as pay stubs, tax returns, bank statements and alike, which the algorithm automatically identifies and places in appropriate digital folders. The model extracts key structured and unstructured data elements from these folders for further validation by a credit team via a workflow that detects exception cases for the compliance team. Our model is based on a transparent rules engine, which we believe will assist our customers and their regulators to comply with the President's recent private letter ruling on model fairness, integrity. And our model is being further extended by us across our expanding mortgage platform. Our experience in building and deploying these learning models also facilitates our research into the cost of computation that is associated with model queries, and it permits us to have a thoughtful understanding of the cost benefit analysis of their deployment and the model's extension. When we acquired the New York Stock Exchange, it was built on a technology stack that was overly complicated, hard to manage and unreliable. So we set off to completely rebuild the underlying architecture with modern technology. Given the importance of the New York Stock Exchange to the global economy, we had to rebuild the exchange while it was in daily use. And its extensive connectivity to the global financial services industry demanded that we not ask our customers to invest in making changes on their side of the firewall. So, we wrap the old technology with a modern front end and methodically rebuilt and replaced all of the back-end hardware and software. This process took us years to execute with our successful final software rollout just a few days ago, deprecating the last of its seven unique legacy matching engines. Our upgrade blueprint worked. And today, the New York Stock Exchange sits atop one of the most powerful, deterministic performance and resilient tech stacks in the world. This same plan to build a new bridge while the cars continue to drive across it was deployed by us when we acquired Interactive Data Corporation. There, we inherited over 100 legacy servers, many of which literally could not be shut down for fear of not being able to properly restart them. We, again, replaced this mess with a modern data superstore over a period of six years and without sacrifice from our customer base. When we made our initial investment in MERS, its technology was outsourced, and was not able to keep up with the demands placed on it during the financial crisis. Our business deal with MERS ownership consortium was to rebuild the platform within two years. If successful, we had an option to buy and run the company. We did just that. And MERS is now a cornerstone to our broad US mortgage industry platform. With our acquisition of Black Knight, we've again undertaken a blueprint to wrap its legacy technologies, tie it to our mortgage platform for near seamless integration with our customer base and rebuild its tech stack with a modern architecture over the coming years. As I've mentioned on past calls, ICE is agnostic to cloud providers, but we also operate our own proprietary cloud with ICE data centers having connectivity to a vast portion of the global financial services industry. This allows us to oversee our costs and stand behind our performance, a cloud strategy that Warren mentioned was a contributor to our record earnings in the quarter. In summary, my comments today highlight three backdrops that ICE follows to evolve our all-weather business model. We invest in environments that may have fallen out of favor and at times when customers need us the most. We embrace regulatory shifts and the workflow alterations that inevitably follow periods of economic change. And we embraced an experiment with new technologies, while enhancing technology assets that we may acquire to drive platform efficiencies and better serve our customers. Shifting now to ICE's strong results. Please turn to Slide 10. In the third quarter, we delivered the best quarter in our company's history with record revenues, record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. We have intentionally positioned our company to provide customer solutions in numerous geographies and economic conditions to facilitate all weather results. These record-setting third quarter results against our extraordinary third quarter results of last year are another example of strong execution across our platform. And I'd like to end our prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their continued business and their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to our best ever quarterly results following up on our unsurpassed results of the first half. And with that, I'll now turn our call back to our moderator, Lauren, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time. Thank you, Lauren, for managing the call, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Let me again thank my colleagues for delivering a record third quarter and definitely want to thank our customers for their continued business and their trust. We'll be updating you again soon as we continue to innovate around our all-weather business model and build solutions for our customers and generate growth on top of growth. So with that, I hope you all have a great day."

            "name": "Jeff Sprecher",
            "content": "This is Jeff. Thanks for the question. I think it's a complicated environment because while the Basel rules are being discussed, every country that we do business in seems to be thinking about implementing them slightly differently, which sort of begs the question, will the market coalesce around a single standard? And who in that coalescing process has the influence to drive the consensus? And we don't really know yet. But you're right in that some of the proposals in the most draconian cases could be significant on banks. And we - if you step back and you just look at our business in a macro level, and I mentioned it even in the prepared remarks that I wrote that ICE believes in standardized, transparent, widely distributed, regulated businesses. And any regulatory or government action that pushes the market towards more transparency and more standardization is good for us. In some cases, I made the point - I tried to make the point in my prepared remarks that it's been my experience that whenever there's been an economic change, either an economic downturn or even an economic upturn as there's a transition to a different economic environment seems like regulators take a look and try to figure out what's different. And we have tended to benefit over the history of this company from those changes. It's partly why I say that we're not anti-regulation, and we are willing to adapt to regulation because I think the kind of way we do business is what ultimately regulators are looking for transparency and wide distribution and standardization. But yes, thank you for the question. We're thinking about it, I think the same way you phrased your question."

            "name": "Benjamin Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. I would like to first welcome the Black Knight team to their first ICE earnings call. While it has been less than two months since we closed on the acquisition in early September, we've been very impressed by the collaboration between our teams during this short time, a testament to the talent of our respective employee populations and our shared entrepreneurial cultures. Similar to our exchanges and fixed income businesses, Black Knight integrated into our ICE Mortgage Technology network, a network that thrives by offering a value proposition that aligns growth with efficiency gains that we bring to our customers. As we have seen across our network in futures and fixed income, these efficiency gains are best achieved through harnessing unstructured data to create mission-critical information, seamlessly linking participants to that information and ensuring that the network technology underpinning are of the highest quality and security. It is the execution of this value proposition that often propels an analog to digital conversion of an industry, and it is a blueprint we've applied across all our businesses. A number of years ago, we saw the importance of investing in an energy platform that is truly global, one that better serves the needs of an evolving and growing commercial customer base. Today, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers are not only seeking liquidity in the major gold benchmarks, but also in products that provide for greater hedging pursuit. Our global oil complex spans over 700 products, including locational spreads, product spreads and refining spreads. These products are built off of our benchmark contracts, such as Brent crude oil and gas oil. Driven by the breadth of our commercial customer base, we have become the natural home for liquidity in these products with open interest in our oil complex up 26% year-over-year through the end of October, including a 28% increase in our other crude and refined products. In our natural gas markets, we began investing in the globalization of these markets over a decade ago. Today, our European TTF and Asian JKM gas complexes continue to grow and reach important milestones as they evolve into global gas benchmarks. In the third quarter, the number of participants in each market grew double digits year-over-year and TTF reached another quarter of record volumes. This strong performance helped drive record revenues across our natural gas complex through the first nine months of 2023, up 37% year-over-year. In addition - interest trends for TTF and JKM remained strong through October, up 58% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. This strength continues to underscore the significance of our contracts to the price formation of global natural gas. We are well positioned to both benefit from the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets because we operate a global gas market with benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia. In our environmental markets, we recognize the importance of carbon price transparency over 10 years ago by acquiring the Climate Exchange in 2010 and building around those leading markets to develop a global environmental business. As we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is illustrated by continued growth in active market participants, up 9% year-over-year. Importantly, because we offer one of the broadest suites of environmental products across the carbon cycle, we remain excited about our position to serve customers as they navigate the journey to clean energy and as the demand for transparent pricing in carbon grows. In summary, these cleaner energy sources combined, including global natural gas and environmental make up over 40% of our energy revenues today and have grown 17% on average over the past five years, including a 30% growth year-to-date. As the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmentals, alongside our gas and oil complexes, will provide the price transparency across the energy spectrum needed to manage these evolving risks. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. As fixed income markets electronify and passive investing grows, our comprehensive all-weather platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth, up 7% year-to-date. Investments we've made to enhance content and functionality across our other data and network services business continue to pay dividends. Year-to-date, this part of our business is up 7%, driven by strength across our desktop, derivatives analytics and feed offerings as customers continue to modernize workflows. Within our desktops business, the investments we have made to reduce friction across the workflow have contributed to double-digit revenue growth year-to-date, along with double-digit growth in the number of users that connect to our ICE Chat platform. Similarly, within our consolidated feeds business, investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering have led to accelerating adoption by large financial institutions. This has directly contributed to high single-digit growth in this area year-to-date. In addition, we continue to see strength in our index business driven by double-digit growth in ETF assets under management as of the end of the third quarter, with now over $0.5 trillion in assets selecting ICE indices as the passive benchmark. As we move forward, we will continue to build on our track record of adding efficiencies and bringing transparency to opaque asset classes, leveraging our mission-critical data assets and market-leading technology. Turning now to our mortgage business. Like what we saw in the commodity markets 20 years ago, there's an analog to digital conversion occurring in the U.S. residential mortgage industry. Critical to our ability to execute on this opportunity is our network, one that in combination with Black Knight, spans from consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary market. In the third quarter, our mortgage business once again outperformed the broader industry that experienced a nearly 20% decline in origination volumes. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. And during the third quarter, of the Encompass customers that came up for renewal, roughly 60% increase their base subscriptions. Importantly, where customers decline in subscriptions, the trade-off is a higher per closed loan fee, which will provide an uplift in transaction revenues when the market returns. In addition, part of our thesis has been at clients that have origination businesses, combined with servicing businesses, we want to bring together a complete front-to-back experience for their clients through one trusted platform provider. As mentioned last quarter, JPMorgan Chase has selected Encompass for their loan origination system across all channels and has implemented or is implementing our data and document automation platform. These wins are on top of a long-standing, great relationship with MSP for servicing, which now positions us to provide a platform to help facilitate their front-to-back experience for their clients. And since we closed on Black Knight, I am pleased to share two new wins along the same lines. First, M&T Bank has now selected Encompass to replace their existing loan origination platform and has added our data and document automation platform on top of the existing MSP relationship for servicing, again, positioning us to provide our platform to support the front-to-back experience for their clients. The second new win is with Fifth Third Bank. We have cross-sold MSP and several data and analytics products to Fifth Third Bank, an existing IMT customer, our consumer engagement solutions and all regs product. In summary, these are major wins for us and serve as a validation of our vision with large clients bringing together a complete front-to-back experience for their clients through one trusted platform provider. The relationships with these great customers are models we plan to replicate with many more. Increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. This trend gives us confidence that we can grow the business that today is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Hi, Ken. It's Ben. Thank you for the question. We see all the investments that we've been doing in our oil platform as a truly global platform that's all complementary to one another. As the clear trend around the world has been under investment in energy infrastructure, so you have a lot of volatility in energy when there's any kind of supply shocks. You've got electronification continuing to take hold. You have energy markets that are truly global. You got supply chains that are evolving and changing and people are looking for more precision and risk management. So with all the investments that we've been making in our global oil platform, we take all that into account, we're engaging with customers now more than ever, and we're getting feedback that there's a need for more precise instruments, pricing Middle East oil that's destined for China. That's what created that Murban contract and ICE futures Abu Dhabi, and it's grown nicely. In parallel to that, Brent, which is the centerpiece of that entire complex is up both in OI and volume year-over-year. So we see them as complementary trading assets that run side by side. We also continue to see investments like our HOU contract in the U.S., which is pricing Midland barrels coming out of Midland, going into Houston and then eventually making its way into our dated Brent contract. We're seeing that contract also continue to grow. So we see these all as very complementary assets to one another. And even within the Middle East itself, you look at our Dubai contract. That contract is up in volumes 80% year-over-year, with OI up close to 50% year-over-year. So we, again, see them all as very complementary assets that traders look at both for the precision that, that particular instrument provides, but then also trading them in parallel to the other benchmark contracts. Yes. Thank you for the question. And as we've said in a number of calls, our hypothesis has been that the combination of these businesses will create, for the first time, an opportunity for our clients to have one d1 trusted platform provider for that complete front-to-back experience for their clients. And you heard a lot from in our prepared remarks about the sales success across our platform. And we believe that based on that success as well as the funnel we see ahead of us, that we have a platform that's really spring loaded as the market normalizes as loans are growing. And just unpacking some more detail what's going on under the cover. So we mentioned we had a solid Q3 in Encompass sales in the third quarter and then also in October. And as Warren pointed out in his prepared remarks, we've had a record sales year and we still have a couple of months to go in the year. So that's playing out very well for us. As we mentioned, we won M&T Bank, that's already an existing MSP customer. They're adding both Encompass and our DDA platform. We've won TriPoint that's moving to Encompass. And then we've also had an expansion with a client called The Federal Savings Bank, adding our data and document automation platform on top of the existing Encompass relationship. There's - switching to MSP. There's no doubt that there was some pent-up demand on MSP as there was an overhang on the deal with clients waiting to see how it was going to come through. And now we're seeing a number of deals that have come through. We mentioned Fifth Third Bank replacing their existing platform provider. They're also adding a number of data products as part of that deal as well. We've also added Black Hills Federal Credit Union, which is an existing Encompass client, has now added as I look at it, is incredibly strong. And - but as Warren also commented in his prepared remarks, this is core infrastructure that's going into these clients, and it does take time for them to implement across both MSP as well as on the loan origination side. You've got a six to 18-month window to implement these clients. But then once implemented, we're getting new loans under our platform and on our network. So the final thing I'd point out is we're also not losing customers. We're not losing significant customers on the platform. And that's why I used the comment that we're spring-loaded because as we see the market environment is going to normalize at some point in time, the loan growth that we've had in our platform positions us very well to achieve those long-term objectives of the growth criteria that we've outlined. Hi, Kyle. This is Ben. It actually - those types of trends play into our overall thesis and hypothesis in this space is that there is opportunity to create more efficiency around the transactions. For us, we're neutral in that space. We don't have a business of selling leads to real estate brokers and the like. For us, our core businesses are all in and around the origination transaction itself, making sure that we're matching the client to the ideal product that meets their needs at the lowest cost to improve access to homeownership as well as clients that have an existing home, identifying based on data and analytics the best product to cross-sell to that client, the best time for clients to have a servicing book as well as an origination book. So when we talk about that whole front-to-back offering, that's really our sweet spot. So we don't see an impact to us negative. If anything, all of the data and analytics offerings that we have that underpin this overall platform front to back, both between ICE Mortgage Technology assets that we've had historically as well as the data assets that have come with the Black Knight business, all position us very well in that space going forward."

            "name": "Lynn Martin",
            "content": "Yes. And it's Lynn. I'll just chime in with some color of what we're seeing. As we said on previous calls, this segment, in particular, really shows the all-weather nature of ICE. And if you look at the execution side of the business, ICE bonds, in particular, had really strong growth over the last quarter, particularly given the muted volatility in the muni markets where we've been able to continue to increase our adoption by the retail and wealth side of the businesses as well as benefit from the increased adoption by institutional users contributing to share gains in all of our different products. Now bringing that through to the fixed income data and analytics side of the business, as we've continued to interact with the front office customers, we've seen continued increasing demand for our front office tools. So while small contributors to the overall bottom line, products like CEP, best execution that we've talked about in the past, there continues to be strong demand for those products as fixed income markets continue to electronify. You've seen that manifest itself in a shortening sales cycle, which has been a - which has really benefited us in terms of the pipeline contribution, the pipeline conversion rates in the short term. Additionally, as we've continued to see money flow into fixed income ETFs, as is evidenced by 30% growth year-on-year at the end of Q3 into our index AUM, we've continued to see that manifest itself in terms of demand for the data, demand for our indices, demand for services around our indices. So we continue to be optimistic that we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on the trend of fixed income electronification and the optimization of workflows in fixed income. Yes, Alex, this is Lynn. Thanks so much for the question. So if you look at the Fixed Income and Data Services segment as a whole, I talked about some of the all-weather nature that attributed really to the fixed income data and analytics line and the executions line in just a bit ago. But the one area that we've continued to see as a really strong contributor to the bottom line, top line is the other data services business and the acceleration of that business throughout the year. And that's really been fueled by a couple of different areas. Number one is our multiyear investment and the modernization of the tech stack associated with our distribution platforms. And on the macro side, is the continued strong demand for our products and services fueled by the broader adoption of automation across the industry in a variety of different areas, which feels like we're still in the early stages of. So we're seeing the confluence of these items benefit the top line growth in this area, and that causes us to be optimistic for continued growth in this area, in particular, for the medium term. We've been very deliberate, as Jeff mentioned on his call to be cloud agnostic and really invest in our own data centers. One of the reasons that we did that was really in response to customer demand as increased automation tends to be a data-heavy area as well as fueling demand for things such as data center space and customers asking us to grow their data center footprint. As a result, and what we've seen more recently, our connectivity sales in Q3 were the second highest in our history. Now those are going to take some time to implement, obviously, before we see the benefits of that in terms of revenue. And our desktop sales last quarter matched our historical high. So we continue to be optimistic that the trends are going to be positive for this area given the pipeline that we have in this area and given the more recent sales that we've been able to achieve. On our feeds business, which we talked a little bit about in our prepared remarks, we benefit from the automation trend as workflows continue to become more automated and customers continue to value the modernization efforts we've undertaken to streamline our technology. So we've been able to attain a variety of new [logos] more recently and then also benefit from historical Tier 1 logos and their increased adoption of our services. And then finally, the area that continues to drive growth in this area, and we think it's the early stages, is the adoption of our large language model, our proprietary large language models in our chat platform. Our chat user growth is up 13% year-to-date, and the increased usage in the models has driven not only revenue benefits here, but also activity generated within our energy markets which activity generated through large language models in our energy markets was up 90% quarter-on-quarter compared to last year and 70% year-to-date. So, there's a variety of trends that we see as tailwinds for this line, in particular, to continue to drive compound and growth for the medium to long-term. Yes. Lynn, thanks for the question. In terms of the allocation of AUM, we have definitely seen an improvement - variety of equity indices, for example, although they're relatively small compared to our core fixed income indices where you've seen an uptick in the amount of AUM that had moved into them. Those being our biotech, semiconductor and some of our other more bespoke indices. In terms of the fixed income allocation, governments have continued to grow in terms of AUM, but you've also seen higher capture classes such as high-yield, which we're really well known for, investment grade and our unique indices gain some share as well. So it's a bit of everything growing in terms of AUM, but that has definitely slowed into some of our higher capture products, which has resulted in our index revenues growing nicely, particularly as compared with last year at this time. In terms of the yield profile, it's a really good question. You saw our core products such as munis have muted volatility during the summer months, not overly unexpected. You've seen volatility in those products start to spike up again as we enter the fall, and that's really a trend that's continued throughout October, in particular. Treasuries have also been a nice grower for us in terms of transactions. We've also seen growth though in things like CDs and our money market product CDs and then agencies as well. So as I mentioned earlier, we've really seen good growth across each of our different products. If you look at the amount of transactions on our platform in Q3 as compared with last year Q3, in fact, the amount of transactions are up 53%. So I think that really positions us nicely because of all the hard work the team has done to penetrate the wealth side of the business. Obviously, retail has been a good grower for us traditionally and all the hard work that the team has done over the last few years to really build our institutional footprint, which we continue to see expanding both in terms of activity and a number of participants on our platform. So I think we're really positioned nicely going into the more volatile time that we're in right now."

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our third quarter results. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was a record, totaling $1.46, up 11% year-over-year. Net revenues totaled $2 billion and on a pro forma basis, increased 4% versus last year, driven by double-digit growth in our Exchange segment which was led by 22% growth in our futures platform. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $812 million, including $56 million related to Black Knight and $756 million related to legacy ICE, which was $4 million below the - of our original guidance range, largely driven by lower technology spend, including reduced cloud exposure as we continue to optimize and drive efficiency through our data center footprint. As we move into the fourth quarter, we expected adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $955 million to $965 million, with the increase relative to the third quarter, driven by additional rent, D&A and seasonality and capitalized labor as well as a full quarter of expense related to Black Knight. Moving below the line. Adjusted nonoperating expense totaled $114 million, including $41 million of incremental interest expense related to our acquisition of Black Knight. We expect adjusted nonoperating expense in the fourth quarter to between $225 million and $230 million, largely driven by the full core impact of acquisition-related interest expense. It is also worth noting that we have reduced our term loan and CP outstanding by around $700 million since transaction closed in early September. Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter net revenues totaled $1.1 billion, up 10% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $754 million were up 13%, driven by 42% growth in our energy revenues. This strong performance included 48% growth in global natural gas driven by a record quarter of TTF volumes. In addition, we continue to see robust trends across our global oil business with ADV up 40% year-over-year in the third quarter and open interest at the end of October, up 26% year-over-year. As we look to the fourth quarter, it's worth noting that we expect OTC and other revenue to be in the range of $70 million to $75 million, with the third quarter benefiting from a few items that we don't anticipate will repeat. In addition, and in light of the strong performance in our equity options business, where revenues are up 15% year-to-date, we've elected to a regulatory fee holiday, which will temporarily reduce OTC and other revenues by $10 million to $15 million in the fourth quarter. Shifting away from transaction revenues. Recurring revenues increased by 4% year-over-year, including 8% growth in Exchange data services. which is once again driven by double-digit growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data as well as a benefit of a few million dollars related to audit recoveries, which we don't expect will repeat in the fourth quarter. This was partially offset by our listings business where growth in annual listing fees was offset by the rolling off of initial listings fees related to the strong IPO market in 2021. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled $559 million, up 4% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 6%, including 9% growth in ICE bonds and 5% growth in our CDS clearing business. Excluding the impact of the Euronext migration, both recurring revenues and ASV grew by 4%, driven by strong growth across our desktop, feeds and derivative analytics offerings. Within our desktop business, revenues once again grew double digits as we continue to see strong demand from energy and environmental-focused customers as well as the continued robust growth in our ICE chat offering in part driven by growing adoption of large language models. In our consolidated feeds business, we once again grew high single digits and expect to exceed $100 million of revenue for the full year as we continue to realize the benefits of past investments to enhance our platform. In our fixed income, data and analytics business, we generated a record $279 million in the third quarter with sequential growth in revenue driven by our North American pricing and reference data business or PRD. While PRD growth may continue to be below trend in the near term, we're seeing signs of an improved sales cycle alongside strong retention. Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Third quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $330 million, including $87 million related to Black Knight. Recurring revenues totaled $235 million and on a pro forma basis, $396 million, representing nearly 80% of total pro forma segment revenues. Despite the headwinds facing the mortgage industry and the related near-term pressure on our recurring revenues, sales continued to be robust as customers look to reshape and modernize how they do business. Through October, we have already surpassed our prior full year record for new Encompass sales, which was set in 2020. In our servicing solutions business, the closing of the Black Knight transaction has unlocked the pipeline with four new MSP customers signed October alone, including a top 25 servicer, Fifth Bank. This compares to a total of five signings through the first nine months of the year and has quickly put 2023 on track to be the second best year for MSP sales since 2017. In addition, as we look to 2024 and continuing the momentum, we have seen post close, the current pipeline for MSP is at its highest level in five years. While we expect the secular trend of customers seeking greater efficiency across their workflows to continue, it's important to note that these strong sales results will take time to implement. And looking to the fourth quarter, we anticipate near-term cyclical headwinds will persist, coupled with typical seasonal pressures on origination volumes in the first and fourth quarters of each year, we expect the total fourth quarter IMT revenues will be in the range of $490 million to $500 million, bringing full year pro forma - revenues to approximately $2.06 billion and in the middle of the guidance range we provided on our Black Knight closing call in late September. In summary, at a consolidated ICE level, we once again grew revenues, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share. And as we look to the end of the year and into 2024, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and to create value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. For now, I'll hand it over to Ben. Hi, It's Warren. So I'll talk a little bit about the pricing, and I'm going to hand it over to Lynn to talk about some of the color on what we're seeing on the fixed income data analytics side. So on the pricing side, we - it would have been a couple of years now that we talked about a third or so of the growth we felt like would come from pricing. I'd say that, look, it will move around each year, so it's not necessarily perfectly consistent in that way. But certainly, as you look over the last number of years that we've had the IDC asset, it's been pretty much in that range. And so as we're thinking towards next year, I think it's fair to be thinking that will continue. And it's underpinned by the philosophy you've heard us articulate a number of times on these calls and that we really just look to capture value when we bring it to our customers. And that's really what we're doing when we think about price within the fixed income and data analytics business and really across the platform. So we're going to continue to do that in that business, similar to what we have over the last couple of years. Hi Brian, it's Warren. So, I think, yes, you throw out a couple of numbers there, all correct, of course. But when we think about those revenue synergies, I think the best way to be thinking about it is - and you pointed out one point that I think is important is it takes a little bit long for these to implement. But I think about it more the OpEx of it being more hockey stick like. And so I think in the early year you probably don't have as much, but that as we obviously move to the next couple of years and through year five, you're going to see those start to build. So, - and part of that is, look, we've got to integrate the companies and we start to get going on some of the areas that we've talked to out on not only the core products, but also on some of the data products that we want to cross-sell across the platform as well. And so that takes a little bit of time in addition to some of the implementation timelines we talked about as well. So, I think about it. Certainly, we're going to have some here. Ben talked about a number of wins that we've had. But again, there's going to be an implementation time line for those. But certainly, we are off to a very strong start there, and it's really encouraging in terms of us getting to those targets ultimately. Hi Simon. So, we generally look at the composite, the forecasters as you're aware of the NBA, Sandy and Freddie, and we're looking at those. We also have some other data around our loan volumes and, of course, MERS registrations that we all pulled together. And so that - your fair - it's a fair question to ask because, obviously, the forecasters are working with somewhat imperfect information, and you see revisions here and there at times too. So, - but that's generally what we saw. We did see in the quarter some Encompass closed loans down in the high teens. So, I think we did well versus the market. And so that's an encouraging sign, of course. There is, within those transaction revenues, which is what you might be referencing to some extent there, some other elements there. I mean, professional services fees are in there. Now, with Black Knight, we have default management revenues. You've got some MERS registrations that there's deferrals related to. So, there are some things in there that, of course, are not perfectly correlated with what's going on in the mortgage market over this current period, if you will, that will create some noise. But I think in terms of how we're performing within the closed loan component of that, it's been encouraging. And again, it's part of its adoption and new customers coming online at some of the sales we've had. And I think as you move into next year, and certainly based on what you heard from Ben, we continue to have success there. So, I think that, that will continue to drive that kind of an outcome. Thanks for the question, Craig, it's Warren. So that's something we're thinking about, I think, as I said on prior calls. And you're right, it's - the headline price changes are not something we had traditionally done. We have always gone into markets and injected market maker tiers and things - in incentive programs and things of that nature. But it's not something that we've done historically at the headline level. We did do it this year, and I think it's been relatively successful. We certainly are, as we move into our budget season here at the moment, thinking about what we might be able to do on that front. I think as we said previously, it's something that we will pick our spots on. I don't expect us to do it on the same products every year. But certainly, we have not done a lot on many other products across, not just energy, but other areas of futures. And so we'll be thoughtful about that. Again, it all comes back to us thinking about what kind of value we've created for the customer and pricing appropriately for that. And so as we think through that, you'll see some - potentially see some announces there. But I don't know that I'd expect it to be on the same products every single year. We'll - again, I think we'll pick our spots as we think through that."

All lines will be muted during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for questions-and-answers at the end. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to pass the conference over to our host, Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations. Katia, please go ahead.\nKatia Gonzalez: Good morning. ICE's second quarter 2023 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2022 Form 10-K, second quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. In addition, as we announced last year, ICE has agreed to acquire Black Knight. The transaction is still pending regulatory approval and we expect to close in the second half of this year. In connection with the proposed transaction, ICE has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of ICE common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction. The registration statement includes a proxy statement of Black Knight that also constitutes a prospectus of ICE. Please see the Form S-4 filing for additional information regarding the transaction. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; and Lynn Martin, President of NYSE. I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.43, up 8% year-over-year, driven by total net revenues of $1.9 billion. This marked the best second quarter on our company's history and it was on top of 14% adjusted EPS growth in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $756 million, $7 million below the low end of our guidance range, and up 2% versus the prior year. Higher SG&A, including an increase in spend related to an uptick in IPO activity late in the second quarter, as well as higher D&A and rent, both of which were driven by handful of lease write-offs as we consolidate our real estate footprint was offset by higher capitalized labor and lower professional fees. This strong performance helped to drive an adjusted operating margin of 60% and a 5% increase in adjusted operating income to $1.1 billion, which was on top of 14% growth in the second quarter of 2022. Looking to the third quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $760 million to $770 million with the year-over-year increase driven by additional compensation and technology expense, as well as roughly $10 million of FX. As a result, we now expect the full-year adjusted operating expenses will be between $3.04 billion and $3.06 billion, and towards the lower end of our guidance range. Moving below the line, adjusted non-operating expense totaled $84 million in the quarter, improving sequentially due to higher cash balances as we build consideration for our acquisition of Black Knight, as well as higher interest rates on those cash balances. Shifting to the tax rate. As the increase in the UK tax rate became effective in April of this year, we confirmed our ability to make certain U.S. tax elections, which primarily led to a second quarter adjusted tax rate of 22%. As a result, we now expect to be around the low end of our 24% to 26% guidance range for both the second half and full-year. Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Second quarter net revenues totaled $1.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $736 million were up 12%, driven by 33% growth in energy revenues. This strong performance included 52% growth in global natural gas revenues, driven by a record quarter for both TTF volumes and participation, as well as 9% growth in our environmental revenues. In addition, we continue to see robust trends across our global oil business, particularly our crude oil benchmarks, Brent, Murban, Dubai, WTI, and Midland WTI, with ADV up 26% year-over-year in the second quarter, and open interest as of the end of July, up 21% year-over-year. Importantly, this is helping to drive strong open interest trends across our global commodity futures and options complex, including 15% growth in global energy and 21% growth in Ags. Recurring revenues increased by 2% year-over-year, including 6% growth in exchange data services, which was once again driven by double-digit growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data. This was partially offset by our Listings business, where capital markets activity through much of the first half was relatively muted. However, the IPO markets started to open up towards the end of the quarter with the NYSE acting as the backdrop for 91% of total capital raised in the second quarter. In addition, the NYSE continues to lead the industry with a total of 12 operating companies transferring from other exchanges so far this year, representing a combined market cap of roughly $100 billion. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Second quarter revenues totaled $546 million, up 6% versus a year-ago. Transaction revenues increased by 23%, including 17% growth in ICE bonds, and 25% growth in our CDS Clearing business. Excluding the impact of the Euronext migration, both recurring revenues and ASV grew by 4%, driven by strong growth across our analytics, desktop and feeds offerings. Within Desktops, we continue to see strong demand from energy and environmental focused customers, as well as continued robust growth in our ICE Chat offering with the number of users has grown at a 15% CAGR over the last five years to nearly 120,000 at the end of 2Q. This growth has been driven by the investments we have made to reduce friction across the workflow, including the development and refinement of a proprietary large language model within ICE Chat. And as a result of these enhancements, through the first half of this year, we have seen a nearly 60% increase in energy volume executed through our ICE Chat platform. Lastly, within our consolidated feeds business, investments we have made to elevate and enhance our offering continues to pay dividends, evidenced by double-digit revenue growth and a number of wins both in the quarter and first half driven by displacement of larger multi-asset class incumbents. This collective performance is a key driver of our other Data and Network Services business, which increased by 7% in the second quarter and 9%, excluding the impact of Euronext. In our Fixed Income Data and Analytics business, similar to the last few quarters, we experienced an extended sales cycle within our End of Day Pricing business. Somewhat offsetting was a return to year-over-year growth in our Index business, driven by growth in ETF assets under management to record $526 billion as of the end of 2Q. Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Second quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $249 million. Recurring revenues, which account for nearly 70% of segment revenues totaled $164 million and helped to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced nearly 40% decline in origination volumes. While data and analytics recurring revenue grew double digits year-over-year, and nearly two-thirds of our Encompass customers up for renewal during the quarter did so at higher minimums, growth was offset by those electing to renew at lower levels as well as reduced spend on ancillary products such as our CRM and marketing solutions, which tend to be utilized by customers that are more refi focused. Importantly, the vast majority of these customers not only remain on the Encompass and ICE Mortgage Technology platform, but have also signed multi-year contract renewals. While macro conditions appear to be stabilizing and year-over-year pressure on forward-looking application volumes appears to be moderating, evidenced by a mid-teen decline in July applications compared to a nearly 30% decline in 2Q and a nearly 50% decline in the first quarter, current cyclical pressures are now likely to drive our recurring revenue growth into the low single-digit range for the full-year. However, these same cyclical conditions and the need to reexamine legacy cost structures continues to attract customers that have not traditionally utilized the ICE Mortgage Technology platform. As an example, the top five bank that elected to replace their in-house solution with Encompass as their system of record for the retail channel last quarter has now also signed on as an Encompass customer for their correspondent channel. In addition, CrossCountry Mortgage, a top 15 lender and Encompass user, signed on to utilize our analyzers and what was one of the largest data and analytics deals in our history, following JPMorgan's adoption of our Analyzer suite last year. While these wins will take time to implement and are therefore not expected to impact our 2023 recurring revenues, it's a clear example of the increasing need for workflow efficiencies. And we expect there to be continued momentum through the balance of this year and into 2024. Moving to Slide 8. In summary, it was a record first half. We delivered revenue, operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow growth. We continue to make strategic investments across our business and future profitable growth opportunities. And we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers and create value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll hand it over to Ben.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. Amidst the dynamic macro environment we've witnessed in the first half of 2023, our customers continue to rely on our leading technology, mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to manage their risk. Across our commodities markets, average daily volumes increased 17% in the quarter and were up 7% when compared with the first half of 2022, including a 16% growth in energy and a 27% growth in our agricultural portfolio in the second quarter as customers respond to changing weather patterns given the El Nino conditions and its impact on commodity supplies. In energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution towards cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up over 40% of our energy revenues and have grown double digits on average over the past five years. This strong performance has contributed to an average annual growth rate of 8% in our energy platform over that period, growth that is a direct result of staying close to our customers, understanding their evolving risk management needs and expanding the breadth of the content that we offer across our energy network. In our oil markets, ICE's Brent benchmark, the largest crude oil futures and options market in the world, has undergone its latest evolution with the addition of Midland WTI into the Brent basket, creating a new Midland exposure for the oil market to manage. Reflecting this dynamic, ICE Midland WTI reached record volumes during the quarter, along with a series of open interest records in July. In addition, commercial customers continue to demand more additional, more precise hedging tools and that we are in a unique position to provide, given their correlation to our benchmark contracts such as Brent. This trend is best illustrated by the continued growth of our other crude and refined products line, up 17% in the first half and up 33% in the second quarter. In our natural gas markets, driven by a record-setting quarter in our TTF gas benchmark, revenues were up 32% in the first half, including 52% growth in the second quarter. In addition, open interest trends in our global gas complex remained strong through July, up 16% year-over-year, including a 34% increase in our TTF complex and a 15% increase in our North American gas business. Importantly, because we have built a global platform that spans benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from both the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets. In our environmental markets, as we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is illustrated by continued growth in active market participants, up 9% year-over-year. Importantly, because we offer one of the broadest suite of environmental products across the carbon cycle, we remain excited about our position to serve customers as they navigate the journey to cleaner energy and as the demand for transparent pricing in carbon grows. Some recent examples of customer-led innovation include the launch of futures on Washington State's carbon program, along with soon-to-be launched futures on Alberta's carbon program, which is expected to go live in the third quarter. In summary, as the energy evolution continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmental markets alongside our global oil, gas and power markets provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools that will enable participants to navigate this evolution. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. Our comprehensive all-weather platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth, up 9% in the first half. This growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenue growth, a testament to the strategic diversification of our business and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments. Interest rate volatility as well as continued efforts to build institutional connectivity across our platform contributed to a 51% increase in our ICE bonds business in the first half versus last year. In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments made in our other data and network services business, which is up 7% in the first half driven by strong growth across our analytics, desktop and feeds offerings. Turning now to our Mortgage business. In the second quarter, our Mortgage business once again outperformed a broader industry that experienced a nearly 40% decline in origination volumes. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. And during the second quarter, of the Encompass customers that came up for renewal, over 60% increased their base subscriptions. Importantly, where customers decline in subscriptions, the trade-off is a higher per-close loan fee, which will provide an uplift in transaction volumes when the market returns. In addition, we continue to have constructive conversations with customers as they seek greater workflow efficiencies. For example, the top five banks that elected to implement Encompass as their system of record for the retail channel last quarter has expanded their relationship with us, signing on as an Encompass customer for their correspondent channel. And during the quarter, we had one of the largest data and analytics deals in our history with the signing of CrossCountry Mortgage to implement our analyzer offering. Importantly, increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. This trend gives us confidence that we can grow a business that today is only a fraction of the $10 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. Our ability to capture this secular trend is illustrated on Slide 22 of the appendix. While origination volumes on the Encompass platform in the first half were comparable if not slightly below those seen in the first half of 2018, pro forma IMT revenues have increased over 50% with recurring revenues growing at a 14% compounded annual growth rate. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. I'll begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. While we are unable to answer any questions on this call relating to the pending litigation with the Federal Trade Commission, I'll briefly discuss our announcement to divest of Optimal Blue. On July 17, we announced that we entered into an agreement whereby contingent on the close of our acquisition of Black Knight, Constellation Software will acquire Optimal Blue for total consideration of $700 million. This consideration includes $200 million of upfront cash and $500 million in the form of a seller finance note, which we have committed to place into the market within six months following the transaction close. We intend to provide additional performance details upon the closing of Black Knight, but it's worth noting that we continue to target revenue synergies of $125 million and expense synergies of $200 million by year five. As a result of our agreeing to sell Optimal Blue, our federal trial was rescheduled to August 14. And we are in a dialogue with the FTC about potential resolution. The transaction with Constellation Software will keep Optimal Blue and the Empower loan origination system together under a single, highly credible owner. A related agreement will continue and expand our commercial relationship to facilitate Optimal Blue being made fully available to ICE's customers on our open network. As the largest distributor of Optimal Blue via our network, we remain very excited about the value and efficiencies that the combined ICE and Black Knight entities will bring to the end consumer as well as to other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem. Shifting to ICE's strong results, please turn to Slide 11. In the second quarter, we grew revenues. We grew adjusted operating income, and we grew adjusted earnings per share, delivering the best second quarter and the best first half in our company's history. These record-setting first half results reflect on the quality of our strategy and more importantly, on the execution of that strategy. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues, giving investors upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. We've intentionally diversified across asset classes and geographies so that we are not tied to any one cyclical trend or macroeconomic environment. We've placed the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog to digital conversion. We believe that the combination of these factors is what makes ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth. Looking to the second half of the year and beyond, we are positioned to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes. And we remain focused on executing on the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, extending our track record of growth. Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our record second quarter, making this an unsurpassed first half result for our company. With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Bailey. And we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Please go ahead, Dan. Your line is now open.\nDaniel Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. My first question is on the mortgage side. So curious as to what percentage of Encompass customers have gone through the renewal process. You've given some updates on the kind of renewal and what people have been doing. But curious about where you are in that full process. And then broadly looking forward on the mortgage side, there is an outlook that we've kind of bottomed in terms of activity. Looking at your guidance implies that we're still going to have some pressures for the remainder of this year, but as you think about the overall macro backdrop, are you anticipating volumes here in the second half to start to recover?\nBenjamin Jackson: Hi, Dan, this is Ben. And great questions. Thank you. In terms of the first part of your question of what percentage of the customers have renewed, so we started this process really a couple of years ago. We've had the Ellie Mae business now for three years, and we started talking about this just a couple of years ago. Most customers are on agreements that are around four to five years in duration. So we're roughly halfway through that transition. In terms of how the business is doing from a longer term perspective, we feel great as we've been talking about on many of these calls, how we've been repositioning the ICE Mortgage Technology company to really unlock long-term growth potential. And underneath the covers, we've seen a lot of success towards that. The evidence to that effect is that over the last several quarters, we've mentioned that we've had success renewing more than 60% of our customers at higher subscriptions. And even when we do see that 40% or so or less that are renewing at lower subscription fees, the trade-off there is that we're getting a higher per-close loan fee on each of those. So when the market normalizes, that will be a tailwind towards our transaction revenues. The second thing is we have continued to see in the second quarter some headwinds from M&A consolidation and going out of business, although it's been relatively small. I think the other thing that we've seen in the first half that were in some of our prepared remarks were that there are some ancillary products that roll up into our origination line item that are not Encompass that are more CRM and marketing-oriented platforms that are very targeted towards helping our lenders identify refi opportunities with clients. And the refi environment continues to be very tough, obviously, with the rate environment where it is. Those contracts tend to be one year in duration. They're user-based. And that is an area where the first half of this year, we saw some pretty significant headwinds towards subscription revenue. But we're already seeing some small signs that, that's turning. And when the market normalizes, we feel good about that coming back. In terms of offsets, we continue to have great sales success in the second quarter of this year on the back of Q4, which we mentioned was strong. Q1 was our best ever. Second quarter was our best second quarter in the last six years. We have 41 new clients come onto the Encompass platform. Now of those clients that come on, many of them are midsized clients that come on right away. We start recognizing subscription revenue right away on those clients. There's also a percentage of those clients that are significant large clients such as the large top five global bank that we had mentioned as well as the win with CrossCountry Mortgage in the D&A space. These clients take time to implement. And the way to think about those is that those will start to have an impact on subscription revenue come 2024. And then once those clients are implemented, there's all kinds of new loans that are coming on to our platform and onto our system that we've never interacted with before that we'll start getting additional transaction fees from as well as they interact and consume services off of our open third-party network and we get per-close loan fees from those loans as well. So from a long-term perspective, we feel great about the positioning.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Benjamin Budish from Barclays. Benjamin, please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi there. Good morning and thanks so much for taking the question. I wanted to maybe follow up a little bit on the Mortgage segment. There's a lot of dialogue around sort of the ongoing digitization and sort of similar to the question in terms of the contract renegotiation cycle. I kind of wanted to ask about the cross-sell some of your existing products like AIQ in particular. Just curious where you are in terms of the penetration of the current customer base and how far you think that can go?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Ben. This is Ben. So great name by the way. So from a cross-sell perspective, that's the beauty of this business that we've established that when you look across all of the offerings that we have across our ICE Mortgage Technology network, we touch almost every lender with some of our \u2013 with one of our services on our platform. And we have 3,000 of them that are on our Encompass platform. And we continue to have great success across the spectrum of bringing in new Encompass customers that are utilizing other services that we have on our network and getting new wins across all of the segments that we service. So think of whether it's a bank, a nonbank originator, a broker, a credit union, we continue to have success across each of those segments. And we've also leveraging the overall enterprise that ICE brings to bear. We've been able to leverage that to reposition and have some wins with large banks replacing legacy infrastructure that historically, the business wouldn't have been well positioned to win. So we feel great about that part of the business. In the environment that we're in, we have seen customers very focused on rightsizing their organizations rightfully so with the headwinds that they've seen. And they've been very focused on the core platforms that they run, and Encompass is one of the key ones. So that's why we continue to see great strength there. At the same time, innovative companies and entrepreneurs that are thinking ahead don't want to have to \u2013 as the market is going to turn, and it will turn at some point, don't want to have to chase volumes by hiring armies of people. Again, they want to try to automate and become as efficient as possible in their processing. And that's why we continue to have great success in areas such as AIQ, which we've now rebranded to our ICE data and document automation platform. And some of the examples that we talked about in the prepared remarks were JPMorgan Chase, obviously, significant bank selected us last year. They've just gone live on the platform this year. So we're starting to see some of that to come into our performance. And on the back of that, a top 15 lender and CrossCountry Mortgage has now selected us. So we see innovative companies out there looking to invest in efficiency and automation going into the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from the line of Alex Kramm, UBS. Please go ahead, Alex. Your line is now open.\nAlexander Kramm: Yes. Hey, good morning everyone. Just a quick one on pricing, actually. Last quarter, you obviously made some price moves on the energy trading side. It looked like that came through pretty nicely. So just wondering any lessons learned from there, and can you extend that into other areas is really the question? I mean, you didn't touch any other Futures businesses. Maybe broadly on the Exchange side, around market data and some of the success you're having in energy data in particular, are there more opportunities for pricing that you see now versus previously since you've gone through this experience on pricing here?\nWarren Gardiner: Yes. Alex, it's Warren. It's a great question. And so in terms of the pricing changes we made within the energy complex, as we said last quarter, those were a handful of oil contracts. So we didn't touch everything within energy, but certainly decided at that moment in time, it was a good moment in time to capture some of the value we brought to the asset class over the last number of decades, frankly. And so we spoke to you last quarter, mentioned there would probably be a few pennies of benefit to the RPC. I would say it's about \u2013 it was about $0.03 to $0.04, if you will, so in line with what we were expecting on that front in terms of the benefit from those price changes, all else equal. As we look across the rest of the futures platform and frankly, the rest of the ICE platform, the philosophy as we approach and apply here is going to be the same and has been the same since the beginning. And that's when we see opportunity to capture value that we've created for people and our customers and the asset classes that we operate, we'll think about doing that and frankly, be selective about it and pick our spots. And so I think as you're thinking about that as we move into next year and future years as well, we'll be taking that same approach. And so we did have some success with this on the energy side. Again, I think it's a recognition of, again, the value we created because we certainly see very strong volumes and very strong open interest continue. And I think you'll just see us take a similar approach across the rest of the ICE business as we move into our budget season this year and think about it into the future.\nAlexander Kramm: So more of a next year opportunity is what I'm hearing from you. Sorry for the quick follow-up.\nWarren Gardiner: So I wouldn't expect pricing changes this year. So yes, it will be next year and beyond.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Simon Clinch from Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead, Simon. Your line is now open.\nSimon Clinch: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could just talk a bit more about the environmental products business, and just how that's progressing right now. And so what it's going to take or when we should start to expect to see the growth rates really resume the kind of attractive pace that we saw in previous years prior to last year.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Simon. This is Ben. As you know, we've been thinking about this space for well more than a decade and investing in it. And we feel great about the positioning that we have here, and we're just continuing \u2013 continue to be one of our most significant areas of investment across our futures business because we see that the world is going to continue to have this dynamic of moving towards a cleaner energy environment. That road is going to be bumpy. And the fact that we can enable customers to have on that journey a complete suite of products across oil, gas, power and environmentals, that positions us in a very unique way to help our clients in one place be able to do all of that. On the \u2013 how the performance of the business itself, we feel good about it. You got to remember, in particular, in Europe, there were some headwinds, obviously, last year, both in energy and in the environmentals sector with the unfortunate war in Ukraine. We continue to watch the health of those markets. Obviously, our energy markets have come back very strong. And we continue to monitor both open interest trends as well as market data subscriptions within our environmental complex, which is at a record. We're looking at \u2013 we continue to look at active market participants. That continues to grow in our environmentals. So underneath the covers, it's a very strong market. We have 98% market share of the EUA market space and of what's traded at 96% in North America. So all that underneath the covers is really good. There's some natural tailwinds I mentioned last quarter as well within the European market itself, where a little less than 40% of the sectors in the European economy are required to basically price emissions. And with Fit for 55 coming in place, by 2028, there's another close to 40% that are going to be captured such as maritime roads, buildings. So this is all secular growth drivers towards our European business. Our North American business continues to grow in terms of market participants. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we just recently launched a new Washington carbon program, and we'll be launching later this quarter an Alberta carbon trading program. So it's another area of investment. Another area that we've been thinking about and have been ahead of actually shows up in our oil business, but it's also really environmentally oriented. And that's the high demand for low-carbon fuels. We've been ahead of this, and we've launched contracts called RIN futures. And what these are is basically every year, the EPA sets standards, in other words, guidelines for the amount of renewable fuels that need to be blended into transportation fuels each year so that you can create sustainable jet fuel, renewable diesel when we're filling up our cars, putting clean unleaded fuel into our vehicles. To meet this target, there's a certain amount of production of renewable fuels that are produced, and those get renewable identification numbers. These are bought, sold and traded historically but in a very opaque market. We launched futures on this as a much more efficient way to do this and we continue to see this grow in open interest as well as ADV very rapidly. It's one of the highest growth areas in that other crude and refined reporting line that we mentioned in our prepared remarks. And today, in the last 12 months, we saw roughly 20% to 25% of the physical market under the EPA mandate trading via our futures. And as futures markets mature, they oftentimes trade a multiple of what the physical market is. So it's another area across our portfolio where we're focused on the environmental space. We're looking ahead, and we're seeing some nice growth.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Please go ahead, Kyle. Your line is now open.\nKyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning. Just regarding the elongated sales cycle you mentioned again this quarter, we're seeing some competitors that have also experienced a similar dynamic, but other competitors, including one including one that reported this morning, noted that they're not seeing that elongated sales cycle in their enterprise data business. I guess I just want to hear whether you think there are any competitive share shifts that are occurring in that Fits business that you can see, or whether the slower growth is really entirely driven by the macro environment that we're in. And then also, if you could give some commentary as whether you're seeing any light at the end of the tunnel there in terms of inflections that you're hearing from clients that we may be getting to a better sales cycle environment as we head into 2024.\nLynn Martin: Hi, Kyle, this is Lynn Martin. Thanks for the question. So on the elongated sales cycle, if you look at the Fixed Income and Data Services business, we're definitely seeing it abate when you look at the other data services line. As Warren mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've actually been able to take share from some of the larger incumbents as a result of the significant amount of investment that we've made over the past few years in the delivery, in modernizing the tech stack associated with that business. So you're definitely seeing the elongated sales cycle abate there, given the share we're taking. On the fixed income data and analytics side of the business, we still see some of the effects of the elongated sales cycle. But importantly, what you're seeing is we are taking share in our End of Day Pricing business. We're continuing to take share there. We're continuing to see good growth in some of the smaller line items that make up that overall line item, including the Index business, which, as Warren said in his prepared remarks, is now about $526 billion in AUM benchmarked against it and some of the products that really go along with the trend of automation. So let me just unpack that a little bit. If you look at the big buzz word of the year in the industry, it's really been around the development and implementation of large language models. We're seeing good demand for, and as Warren mentioned in his prepared remarks, the adoption of our proprietary large language models. And you're seeing the effects of that come through in not just our other data services line and the revenue attributed to that line, but you're also starting to see that in other parts of our segments, including the energy trading side of our segment. Additionally, those large language models in a different asset class are what feeds things around fixed income automation, which is a trend that we continue to be uniquely positioned to capitalize on. So products like continuous evaluated pricing, smaller line item but it continues to see outsized growth relative to the other portions of the fixed income data and analytics side of the business. And because of the strength in that part of the business, you're seeing that bleed into the ICE bond execution side of the business, which outpaced the industry in spite of muted volatility in our core muni markets because of share gains due to that automation, the transparency provided by our data as well as the adoption of institutional customers for these services across not just our muni products but also our REITs, our money market products and importantly, starting to see it in our credit products. So overall, we feel really good about how we're positioned. We're not seeing anything in terms of share erosion. On the contrary, we're continuing to see share gains in our core business, but we still are seeing the effects of the elongated sales cycle really in the End of Day Pricing business, which is causing slightly slower growth.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Please go ahead, Craig. Your line is now up.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Hey, good morning everyone. My question is on the Fixed Income business. So given the higher interest rate backdrop, many are predicting large bond reallocations over the next few years. So I wanted to see if you could walk us through your Fixed Income and Data Services business and provide your perspective on how this reallocation could impact the growth trajectories of the verticals inside this business.\nLynn Martin: Hi. This is Lynn again. That's a great question. So a couple of areas as you think about where the yield profile continues to lead. Obviously, the attractive yields in treasuries more recently is what has really driven some of the outsized gains that I just mentioned on the execution side of the business for the treasury execution business and the money market products that we have. The contrary to that you've seen is on the fixed income index business, where our capture rate, as we talked about on some of the previous calls, tends to be lower on our treasury index business. So AUM continues to grow, but it doesn't have a direct correlation to the revenue growth. It's not a one-to-one relationship. As you're starting to see the issuance profile start to return to normal, you will see that in a reallocation of assets under management to the higher capture indices, that being our credit indices, the muni indices and obviously, with the equity markets doing well, our equity indices. But you'll also start to see that impact our pricing and reference data end-of-day business because you will start to see new fund families emerge, new asset funds emerge, which you've not really seen over the last year. In contrast, over the last year, you've seen \u2013 where it's been particularly tough for the fixed income asset managers, you've seen the number of funds decline. We're starting to see green shoots for the reemergence of new funds being created. So I think you'll see a positive impact on a variety of our line items. But again, this is why we've set up the business in the Fixed Income and Data Services segment, in particular, to be an all-weather name to benefit from a variety of macro trends. So treasuries do well. That's going to impact the segment in one way. If munis do well, it's going to impact the segment in another way.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Brian Bedell from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, Brian. Your line is now open.\nBrian Bedell: Great. Thanks very much for taking my question. Maybe just to come back to the ICE Chat offering and the proprietary large language models. And particularly in energy, I think you mentioned it was helpful in stimulating volumes so far this year. Maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about what's actually driving that, how does the Chat offering add volume. Is it bringing new customers into the mix such as market makers? And then where would you think you are on this journey? It sounds like it's relatively new, but do you think you've already sort of enhanced the volumes with this or there's a lot more to come in the future?\nLynn Martin: Yes. This is Lynn again. That's a great question. It's actually a topic we love talking about. So we've had the existence of large language models in our ICE Chat offering for quite some time now. We started with the early stages of it, I'd probably say about a decade ago. But it's really been refined over the last, call it, five years. It's become a contributor though to the energy markets across asset classes, across oil, across gas and across \u2013 starting to impact the utilities as well. Effectively, what it does is it allows for automation. It knows if you and I are talking about the fact that today is Thursday or it knows if we're talking about a trade idea through those models. If it detects a trade idea, it will allow for the seamless transmission of that trade to our clearinghouses and our trading platforms. Additionally, it will give you some fair value analytics and additional metrics around it to allow you to perform that trade with confidence that you're getting a good price. So it's really helping the trader to automate the workflow. It's why it's gained popularity, particularly over the last couple of years as those models have gotten smarter as the technology has improved, quite honestly. But I think we're still in the early stages of this. It's still a small contributor to our volumes, but it's something we're incredibly excited about the potential for not just in energy, but if you think about the rest of the Fixed Income and Data Services segment for fixed income where fixed income markets are desperately requiring automation. So we think this \u2013 the concept has applicability pretty much across all of the markets that we operate, but we're seeing the early-stage benefits in the energy markets, as Warren mentioned in his prepared remarks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today comes from the line of Patrick Moley from Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.\nPatrick Moley: Yes. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So I just wanted to go back to energy. As you mentioned earlier, you're seeing strong volumes, strong open interest growth. I think even though you've had some easier comps, I think it was still the strongest 2Q in your history. So just when we look at the macro landscape, I was hoping you could maybe give us your outlook for the back half of this year in energy. And I think my predecessor asked this on the last call, but is there anything out there right now that maybe you're keeping an eye on that could derail the strong momentum you're seeing in energy? Thanks.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Patrick. This is Ben. So it's clear to us that you got several underlying trends going on in the industry. You continue to have well-publicized underinvestment in legacy energy infrastructure that can cause supply shocks. You've got overall and broadly, electronification, and energy markets continues to take hold. But each of the energy markets and the new innovations that we continue to launch are at various ends of the spectrum of how mature they are in adopting electronification. The energy markets are becoming more global. As supply chains continue to evolve and change, those markets are becoming global, and natural gas is now freely transported around the world in terms of LNG. You also have a trend around precision and risk management. Customers don't just want to trade big benchmark contracts, but they want to trade those in parallel to deep liquid markets that are at the point of production and consumption of where they're concerned about and have to actually buy the product. And there's no \u2013 questionably, the last trend would be a move towards greener energy. And we've built our business with a very long lens towards helping our customers manage risk through all of these. We have a deep liquid set of contracts, hundreds of them around the world. We have a lot of different pricing points across each of those sectors, whether it's commodities, energy, cleaner fuels, environmental markets, gas, power, you name it. We built our business with that diversification and with our customers' needs in mind. And we see the setup is great for us. You look at just the results that we've had. We're at or near an average daily volume market share high in crude oil and across our global oil complex. We're adding open interest market share high in North American gas and global gas. We're at or near an all-time revenue share high in June across energy. We've had record active market participation in multiple products such as TTF gas and continuing to grow rapidly in the environmental space. And our futures markets continue to set records in terms of market data subscribers on to our platform. So overall, we feel great about all those underlying trends. And then to cap it off, you look at what's been going on with Brent, and that being from a futures and options standpoint the largest oil benchmark in the world. A lot of the products that we have are very complementary to that. And with some of the significant changes that are happening were dated Brent, our contract now has Midland TI oil coming into it. The fact that we saw that coming launched our Midland WTI, our ICE Midland WTI contract known as HOU, that contract continues to grow very well. And since Midland TI was introduced into the Brent complex this summer, we've seen that contract continue to grow rapidly. And we've had over 50 million barrels of oil that has now been delivered against that contract. So we feel great about the prospects of where we're positioned, both for the balance of this year and into the future.\nOperator: Thank you. The next question today comes from the line of Alexander Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, Alexander. Your line is now open.\nAditya Soman: Hi. Good morning. This is actually Aditya filling in for Alex. Thanks for taking the question. Another question within fixed income on the execution side. We've seen continued progress in fixed income execution, although from a small base. You've been adding capabilities here with the recent launch of the Sweeps Protocol. Can you provide more KPIs for this business? What are your electronic markets like in IG and high yield? Where do you see it going over the next 12 months? And lastly, how does price compare to incumbent platforms and protocols that you compete in? Thanks.\nLynn Martin: Yes. This is Lynn. Thanks for the question. So traditionally, on the execution side, we've operated in the \u2013 our core market's really been the muni market. Now I think what's really encouraging about this quarter is you saw strong growth from us even though the muni markets have had muted volatility, muted activity this quarter. And I think that's really been attributable to the fact that we really have spent the last couple of years building out our distribution framework and focusing on building our distribution framework and getting access to the institutional users, but also continuing to gain share in retail and wealth. So despite the fact that the muni markets have been quieter in Q2 than over the last year, we were able to gain share, continue to gain share in the retail and wealth side of the business. Now importantly, because we had done the development efforts and the integration efforts into the institutional side of the business, the treasury markets, which had a much more attractive yield profile, were able to have outsized results, which drove the growth in this quarter, which you saw that coming from not just retail and wealth segments, but also the institutional side of the business. And as you noted, we have made significant investments in the technology because the distribution has been there into the institutional side of the business in addition to the traditional wealth and retail side of the business. When we upgraded the technology to perform our sweeps as we announced earlier this week, we've been able to start to gain a bit of share on the corporate side of the business, U.S. corporates in particular, particularly investment-grade over the last few months. Now that's still very early days, but we're optimistic because of the investments that we have made in the platform not just on the technology side, but also building the distribution over the last couple of months and doing it on a market-by-market basis.\nOperator: Thank you. There were no additional questions waiting at this time. So I'd like to pass the call back over to Jeff Sprecher for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Well, thank you, Bailey. Thank you all for joining us this morning. And I'd also like to again thank my colleagues for delivering the best first half in our company's history. And I'd also like to thank our customers for their continued business and for their trust. We look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to innovate and build on this all-weather business model that generates growth on top of growth. And with that, I hope you all have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our second quarter results. Second quarter adjusted earnings per share totaled $1.43, up 8% year-over-year, driven by total net revenues of $1.9 billion. This marked the best second quarter on our company's history and it was on top of 14% adjusted EPS growth in the second quarter of 2022. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $756 million, $7 million below the low end of our guidance range, and up 2% versus the prior year. Higher SG&A, including an increase in spend related to an uptick in IPO activity late in the second quarter, as well as higher D&A and rent, both of which were driven by handful of lease write-offs as we consolidate our real estate footprint was offset by higher capitalized labor and lower professional fees. This strong performance helped to drive an adjusted operating margin of 60% and a 5% increase in adjusted operating income to $1.1 billion, which was on top of 14% growth in the second quarter of 2022. Looking to the third quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $760 million to $770 million with the year-over-year increase driven by additional compensation and technology expense, as well as roughly $10 million of FX. As a result, we now expect the full-year adjusted operating expenses will be between $3.04 billion and $3.06 billion, and towards the lower end of our guidance range. Moving below the line, adjusted non-operating expense totaled $84 million in the quarter, improving sequentially due to higher cash balances as we build consideration for our acquisition of Black Knight, as well as higher interest rates on those cash balances. Shifting to the tax rate. As the increase in the UK tax rate became effective in April of this year, we confirmed our ability to make certain U.S. tax elections, which primarily led to a second quarter adjusted tax rate of 22%. As a result, we now expect to be around the low end of our 24% to 26% guidance range for both the second half and full-year. Now let's turn to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Second quarter net revenues totaled $1.1 billion, up 9% year-over-year. Transaction revenues of $736 million were up 12%, driven by 33% growth in energy revenues. This strong performance included 52% growth in global natural gas revenues, driven by a record quarter for both TTF volumes and participation, as well as 9% growth in our environmental revenues. In addition, we continue to see robust trends across our global oil business, particularly our crude oil benchmarks, Brent, Murban, Dubai, WTI, and Midland WTI, with ADV up 26% year-over-year in the second quarter, and open interest as of the end of July, up 21% year-over-year. Importantly, this is helping to drive strong open interest trends across our global commodity futures and options complex, including 15% growth in global energy and 21% growth in Ags. Recurring revenues increased by 2% year-over-year, including 6% growth in exchange data services, which was once again driven by double-digit growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data. This was partially offset by our Listings business, where capital markets activity through much of the first half was relatively muted. However, the IPO markets started to open up towards the end of the quarter with the NYSE acting as the backdrop for 91% of total capital raised in the second quarter. In addition, the NYSE continues to lead the industry with a total of 12 operating companies transferring from other exchanges so far this year, representing a combined market cap of roughly $100 billion. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Second quarter revenues totaled $546 million, up 6% versus a year-ago. Transaction revenues increased by 23%, including 17% growth in ICE bonds, and 25% growth in our CDS Clearing business. Excluding the impact of the Euronext migration, both recurring revenues and ASV grew by 4%, driven by strong growth across our analytics, desktop and feeds offerings. Within Desktops, we continue to see strong demand from energy and environmental focused customers, as well as continued robust growth in our ICE Chat offering with the number of users has grown at a 15% CAGR over the last five years to nearly 120,000 at the end of 2Q. This growth has been driven by the investments we have made to reduce friction across the workflow, including the development and refinement of a proprietary large language model within ICE Chat. And as a result of these enhancements, through the first half of this year, we have seen a nearly 60% increase in energy volume executed through our ICE Chat platform. Lastly, within our consolidated feeds business, investments we have made to elevate and enhance our offering continues to pay dividends, evidenced by double-digit revenue growth and a number of wins both in the quarter and first half driven by displacement of larger multi-asset class incumbents. This collective performance is a key driver of our other Data and Network Services business, which increased by 7% in the second quarter and 9%, excluding the impact of Euronext. In our Fixed Income Data and Analytics business, similar to the last few quarters, we experienced an extended sales cycle within our End of Day Pricing business. Somewhat offsetting was a return to year-over-year growth in our Index business, driven by growth in ETF assets under management to record $526 billion as of the end of 2Q. Let's go next to Slide 7, where I will discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. Second quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $249 million. Recurring revenues, which account for nearly 70% of segment revenues totaled $164 million and helped to drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced nearly 40% decline in origination volumes. While data and analytics recurring revenue grew double digits year-over-year, and nearly two-thirds of our Encompass customers up for renewal during the quarter did so at higher minimums, growth was offset by those electing to renew at lower levels as well as reduced spend on ancillary products such as our CRM and marketing solutions, which tend to be utilized by customers that are more refi focused. Importantly, the vast majority of these customers not only remain on the Encompass and ICE Mortgage Technology platform, but have also signed multi-year contract renewals. While macro conditions appear to be stabilizing and year-over-year pressure on forward-looking application volumes appears to be moderating, evidenced by a mid-teen decline in July applications compared to a nearly 30% decline in 2Q and a nearly 50% decline in the first quarter, current cyclical pressures are now likely to drive our recurring revenue growth into the low single-digit range for the full-year. However, these same cyclical conditions and the need to reexamine legacy cost structures continues to attract customers that have not traditionally utilized the ICE Mortgage Technology platform. As an example, the top five bank that elected to replace their in-house solution with Encompass as their system of record for the retail channel last quarter has now also signed on as an Encompass customer for their correspondent channel. In addition, CrossCountry Mortgage, a top 15 lender and Encompass user, signed on to utilize our analyzers and what was one of the largest data and analytics deals in our history, following JPMorgan's adoption of our Analyzer suite last year. While these wins will take time to implement and are therefore not expected to impact our 2023 recurring revenues, it's a clear example of the increasing need for workflow efficiencies. And we expect there to be continued momentum through the balance of this year and into 2024. Moving to Slide 8. In summary, it was a record first half. We delivered revenue, operating income, earnings per share and free cash flow growth. We continue to make strategic investments across our business and future profitable growth opportunities. And we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers and create value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now, I'll hand it over to Ben. Yes. Alex, it's Warren. It's a great question. And so in terms of the pricing changes we made within the energy complex, as we said last quarter, those were a handful of oil contracts. So we didn't touch everything within energy, but certainly decided at that moment in time, it was a good moment in time to capture some of the value we brought to the asset class over the last number of decades, frankly. And so we spoke to you last quarter, mentioned there would probably be a few pennies of benefit to the RPC. I would say it's about \u2013 it was about $0.03 to $0.04, if you will, so in line with what we were expecting on that front in terms of the benefit from those price changes, all else equal. As we look across the rest of the futures platform and frankly, the rest of the ICE platform, the philosophy as we approach and apply here is going to be the same and has been the same since the beginning. And that's when we see opportunity to capture value that we've created for people and our customers and the asset classes that we operate, we'll think about doing that and frankly, be selective about it and pick our spots. And so I think as you're thinking about that as we move into next year and future years as well, we'll be taking that same approach. And so we did have some success with this on the energy side. Again, I think it's a recognition of, again, the value we created because we certainly see very strong volumes and very strong open interest continue. And I think you'll just see us take a similar approach across the rest of the ICE business as we move into our budget season this year and think about it into the future. So I wouldn't expect pricing changes this year. So yes, it will be next year and beyond."

            "name": "Benjamin Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 9. Amidst the dynamic macro environment we've witnessed in the first half of 2023, our customers continue to rely on our leading technology, mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to manage their risk. Across our commodities markets, average daily volumes increased 17% in the quarter and were up 7% when compared with the first half of 2022, including a 16% growth in energy and a 27% growth in our agricultural portfolio in the second quarter as customers respond to changing weather patterns given the El Nino conditions and its impact on commodity supplies. In energy, the globalization of natural gas and the evolution towards cleaner energy are trends that we began investing in over a decade ago. And today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmentals, make up over 40% of our energy revenues and have grown double digits on average over the past five years. This strong performance has contributed to an average annual growth rate of 8% in our energy platform over that period, growth that is a direct result of staying close to our customers, understanding their evolving risk management needs and expanding the breadth of the content that we offer across our energy network. In our oil markets, ICE's Brent benchmark, the largest crude oil futures and options market in the world, has undergone its latest evolution with the addition of Midland WTI into the Brent basket, creating a new Midland exposure for the oil market to manage. Reflecting this dynamic, ICE Midland WTI reached record volumes during the quarter, along with a series of open interest records in July. In addition, commercial customers continue to demand more additional, more precise hedging tools and that we are in a unique position to provide, given their correlation to our benchmark contracts such as Brent. This trend is best illustrated by the continued growth of our other crude and refined products line, up 17% in the first half and up 33% in the second quarter. In our natural gas markets, driven by a record-setting quarter in our TTF gas benchmark, revenues were up 32% in the first half, including 52% growth in the second quarter. In addition, open interest trends in our global gas complex remained strong through July, up 16% year-over-year, including a 34% increase in our TTF complex and a 15% increase in our North American gas business. Importantly, because we have built a global platform that spans benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia, we are well positioned to continue to benefit from both the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets. In our environmental markets, as we look out over the longer term, corporates and market participants remain committed to environmental policy to reduce carbon emissions. This is illustrated by continued growth in active market participants, up 9% year-over-year. Importantly, because we offer one of the broadest suite of environmental products across the carbon cycle, we remain excited about our position to serve customers as they navigate the journey to cleaner energy and as the demand for transparent pricing in carbon grows. Some recent examples of customer-led innovation include the launch of futures on Washington State's carbon program, along with soon-to-be launched futures on Alberta's carbon program, which is expected to go live in the third quarter. In summary, as the energy evolution continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility to energy markets, our global environmental markets alongside our global oil, gas and power markets provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools that will enable participants to navigate this evolution. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business. Our comprehensive all-weather platform continues to generate compounding revenue growth, up 9% in the first half. This growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenue growth, a testament to the strategic diversification of our business and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments. Interest rate volatility as well as continued efforts to build institutional connectivity across our platform contributed to a 51% increase in our ICE bonds business in the first half versus last year. In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments made in our other data and network services business, which is up 7% in the first half driven by strong growth across our analytics, desktop and feeds offerings. Turning now to our Mortgage business. In the second quarter, our Mortgage business once again outperformed a broader industry that experienced a nearly 40% decline in origination volumes. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our mission-critical technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry. Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our origination technology and data and analytics business. And during the second quarter, of the Encompass customers that came up for renewal, over 60% increased their base subscriptions. Importantly, where customers decline in subscriptions, the trade-off is a higher per-close loan fee, which will provide an uplift in transaction volumes when the market returns. In addition, we continue to have constructive conversations with customers as they seek greater workflow efficiencies. For example, the top five banks that elected to implement Encompass as their system of record for the retail channel last quarter has expanded their relationship with us, signing on as an Encompass customer for their correspondent channel. And during the quarter, we had one of the largest data and analytics deals in our history with the signing of CrossCountry Mortgage to implement our analyzer offering. Importantly, increased workflow efficiency through continued electronification is a secular trend we believe will continue through a variety of mortgage origination environments. This trend gives us confidence that we can grow a business that today is only a fraction of the $10 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. Our ability to capture this secular trend is illustrated on Slide 22 of the appendix. While origination volumes on the Encompass platform in the first half were comparable if not slightly below those seen in the first half of 2018, pro forma IMT revenues have increased over 50% with recurring revenues growing at a 14% compounded annual growth rate. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Hi, Dan, this is Ben. And great questions. Thank you. In terms of the first part of your question of what percentage of the customers have renewed, so we started this process really a couple of years ago. We've had the Ellie Mae business now for three years, and we started talking about this just a couple of years ago. Most customers are on agreements that are around four to five years in duration. So we're roughly halfway through that transition. In terms of how the business is doing from a longer term perspective, we feel great as we've been talking about on many of these calls, how we've been repositioning the ICE Mortgage Technology company to really unlock long-term growth potential. And underneath the covers, we've seen a lot of success towards that. The evidence to that effect is that over the last several quarters, we've mentioned that we've had success renewing more than 60% of our customers at higher subscriptions. And even when we do see that 40% or so or less that are renewing at lower subscription fees, the trade-off there is that we're getting a higher per-close loan fee on each of those. So when the market normalizes, that will be a tailwind towards our transaction revenues. The second thing is we have continued to see in the second quarter some headwinds from M&A consolidation and going out of business, although it's been relatively small. I think the other thing that we've seen in the first half that were in some of our prepared remarks were that there are some ancillary products that roll up into our origination line item that are not Encompass that are more CRM and marketing-oriented platforms that are very targeted towards helping our lenders identify refi opportunities with clients. And the refi environment continues to be very tough, obviously, with the rate environment where it is. Those contracts tend to be one year in duration. They're user-based. And that is an area where the first half of this year, we saw some pretty significant headwinds towards subscription revenue. But we're already seeing some small signs that, that's turning. And when the market normalizes, we feel good about that coming back. In terms of offsets, we continue to have great sales success in the second quarter of this year on the back of Q4, which we mentioned was strong. Q1 was our best ever. Second quarter was our best second quarter in the last six years. We have 41 new clients come onto the Encompass platform. Now of those clients that come on, many of them are midsized clients that come on right away. We start recognizing subscription revenue right away on those clients. There's also a percentage of those clients that are significant large clients such as the large top five global bank that we had mentioned as well as the win with CrossCountry Mortgage in the D&A space. These clients take time to implement. And the way to think about those is that those will start to have an impact on subscription revenue come 2024. And then once those clients are implemented, there's all kinds of new loans that are coming on to our platform and onto our system that we've never interacted with before that we'll start getting additional transaction fees from as well as they interact and consume services off of our open third-party network and we get per-close loan fees from those loans as well. So from a long-term perspective, we feel great about the positioning. Thanks, Ben. This is Ben. So great name by the way. So from a cross-sell perspective, that's the beauty of this business that we've established that when you look across all of the offerings that we have across our ICE Mortgage Technology network, we touch almost every lender with some of our \u2013 with one of our services on our platform. And we have 3,000 of them that are on our Encompass platform. And we continue to have great success across the spectrum of bringing in new Encompass customers that are utilizing other services that we have on our network and getting new wins across all of the segments that we service. So think of whether it's a bank, a nonbank originator, a broker, a credit union, we continue to have success across each of those segments. And we've also leveraging the overall enterprise that ICE brings to bear. We've been able to leverage that to reposition and have some wins with large banks replacing legacy infrastructure that historically, the business wouldn't have been well positioned to win. So we feel great about that part of the business. In the environment that we're in, we have seen customers very focused on rightsizing their organizations rightfully so with the headwinds that they've seen. And they've been very focused on the core platforms that they run, and Encompass is one of the key ones. So that's why we continue to see great strength there. At the same time, innovative companies and entrepreneurs that are thinking ahead don't want to have to \u2013 as the market is going to turn, and it will turn at some point, don't want to have to chase volumes by hiring armies of people. Again, they want to try to automate and become as efficient as possible in their processing. And that's why we continue to have great success in areas such as AIQ, which we've now rebranded to our ICE data and document automation platform. And some of the examples that we talked about in the prepared remarks were JPMorgan Chase, obviously, significant bank selected us last year. They've just gone live on the platform this year. So we're starting to see some of that to come into our performance. And on the back of that, a top 15 lender and CrossCountry Mortgage has now selected us. So we see innovative companies out there looking to invest in efficiency and automation going into the future. Thanks, Simon. This is Ben. As you know, we've been thinking about this space for well more than a decade and investing in it. And we feel great about the positioning that we have here, and we're just continuing \u2013 continue to be one of our most significant areas of investment across our futures business because we see that the world is going to continue to have this dynamic of moving towards a cleaner energy environment. That road is going to be bumpy. And the fact that we can enable customers to have on that journey a complete suite of products across oil, gas, power and environmentals, that positions us in a very unique way to help our clients in one place be able to do all of that. On the \u2013 how the performance of the business itself, we feel good about it. You got to remember, in particular, in Europe, there were some headwinds, obviously, last year, both in energy and in the environmentals sector with the unfortunate war in Ukraine. We continue to watch the health of those markets. Obviously, our energy markets have come back very strong. And we continue to monitor both open interest trends as well as market data subscriptions within our environmental complex, which is at a record. We're looking at \u2013 we continue to look at active market participants. That continues to grow in our environmentals. So underneath the covers, it's a very strong market. We have 98% market share of the EUA market space and of what's traded at 96% in North America. So all that underneath the covers is really good. There's some natural tailwinds I mentioned last quarter as well within the European market itself, where a little less than 40% of the sectors in the European economy are required to basically price emissions. And with Fit for 55 coming in place, by 2028, there's another close to 40% that are going to be captured such as maritime roads, buildings. So this is all secular growth drivers towards our European business. Our North American business continues to grow in terms of market participants. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we just recently launched a new Washington carbon program, and we'll be launching later this quarter an Alberta carbon trading program. So it's another area of investment. Another area that we've been thinking about and have been ahead of actually shows up in our oil business, but it's also really environmentally oriented. And that's the high demand for low-carbon fuels. We've been ahead of this, and we've launched contracts called RIN futures. And what these are is basically every year, the EPA sets standards, in other words, guidelines for the amount of renewable fuels that need to be blended into transportation fuels each year so that you can create sustainable jet fuel, renewable diesel when we're filling up our cars, putting clean unleaded fuel into our vehicles. To meet this target, there's a certain amount of production of renewable fuels that are produced, and those get renewable identification numbers. These are bought, sold and traded historically but in a very opaque market. We launched futures on this as a much more efficient way to do this and we continue to see this grow in open interest as well as ADV very rapidly. It's one of the highest growth areas in that other crude and refined reporting line that we mentioned in our prepared remarks. And today, in the last 12 months, we saw roughly 20% to 25% of the physical market under the EPA mandate trading via our futures. And as futures markets mature, they oftentimes trade a multiple of what the physical market is. So it's another area across our portfolio where we're focused on the environmental space. We're looking ahead, and we're seeing some nice growth. Thanks, Patrick. This is Ben. So it's clear to us that you got several underlying trends going on in the industry. You continue to have well-publicized underinvestment in legacy energy infrastructure that can cause supply shocks. You've got overall and broadly, electronification, and energy markets continues to take hold. But each of the energy markets and the new innovations that we continue to launch are at various ends of the spectrum of how mature they are in adopting electronification. The energy markets are becoming more global. As supply chains continue to evolve and change, those markets are becoming global, and natural gas is now freely transported around the world in terms of LNG. You also have a trend around precision and risk management. Customers don't just want to trade big benchmark contracts, but they want to trade those in parallel to deep liquid markets that are at the point of production and consumption of where they're concerned about and have to actually buy the product. And there's no \u2013 questionably, the last trend would be a move towards greener energy. And we've built our business with a very long lens towards helping our customers manage risk through all of these. We have a deep liquid set of contracts, hundreds of them around the world. We have a lot of different pricing points across each of those sectors, whether it's commodities, energy, cleaner fuels, environmental markets, gas, power, you name it. We built our business with that diversification and with our customers' needs in mind. And we see the setup is great for us. You look at just the results that we've had. We're at or near an average daily volume market share high in crude oil and across our global oil complex. We're adding open interest market share high in North American gas and global gas. We're at or near an all-time revenue share high in June across energy. We've had record active market participation in multiple products such as TTF gas and continuing to grow rapidly in the environmental space. And our futures markets continue to set records in terms of market data subscribers on to our platform. So overall, we feel great about all those underlying trends. And then to cap it off, you look at what's been going on with Brent, and that being from a futures and options standpoint the largest oil benchmark in the world. A lot of the products that we have are very complementary to that. And with some of the significant changes that are happening were dated Brent, our contract now has Midland TI oil coming into it. The fact that we saw that coming launched our Midland WTI, our ICE Midland WTI contract known as HOU, that contract continues to grow very well. And since Midland TI was introduced into the Brent complex this summer, we've seen that contract continue to grow rapidly. And we've had over 50 million barrels of oil that has now been delivered against that contract. So we feel great about the prospects of where we're positioned, both for the balance of this year and into the future."

            "name": "Jeffrey Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 10. I'll begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. While we are unable to answer any questions on this call relating to the pending litigation with the Federal Trade Commission, I'll briefly discuss our announcement to divest of Optimal Blue. On July 17, we announced that we entered into an agreement whereby contingent on the close of our acquisition of Black Knight, Constellation Software will acquire Optimal Blue for total consideration of $700 million. This consideration includes $200 million of upfront cash and $500 million in the form of a seller finance note, which we have committed to place into the market within six months following the transaction close. We intend to provide additional performance details upon the closing of Black Knight, but it's worth noting that we continue to target revenue synergies of $125 million and expense synergies of $200 million by year five. As a result of our agreeing to sell Optimal Blue, our federal trial was rescheduled to August 14. And we are in a dialogue with the FTC about potential resolution. The transaction with Constellation Software will keep Optimal Blue and the Empower loan origination system together under a single, highly credible owner. A related agreement will continue and expand our commercial relationship to facilitate Optimal Blue being made fully available to ICE's customers on our open network. As the largest distributor of Optimal Blue via our network, we remain very excited about the value and efficiencies that the combined ICE and Black Knight entities will bring to the end consumer as well as to other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem. Shifting to ICE's strong results, please turn to Slide 11. In the second quarter, we grew revenues. We grew adjusted operating income, and we grew adjusted earnings per share, delivering the best second quarter and the best first half in our company's history. These record-setting first half results reflect on the quality of our strategy and more importantly, on the execution of that strategy. We've deliberately positioned the company to have a mix of transaction and compounding subscription revenues, giving investors upside exposure while hedging our downside risk. We've intentionally diversified across asset classes and geographies so that we are not tied to any one cyclical trend or macroeconomic environment. We've placed the company at the center of some of the largest markets undergoing an analog to digital conversion. We believe that the combination of these factors is what makes ICE an all-weather name that generates growth on top of growth. Looking to the second half of the year and beyond, we are positioned to capitalize on the secular and cyclical trends occurring across asset classes. And we remain focused on executing on the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, extending our track record of growth. Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to thank our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to our record second quarter, making this an unsurpassed first half result for our company. With that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Bailey. And we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time. Well, thank you, Bailey. Thank you all for joining us this morning. And I'd also like to again thank my colleagues for delivering the best first half in our company's history. And I'd also like to thank our customers for their continued business and for their trust. We look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to innovate and build on this all-weather business model that generates growth on top of growth. And with that, I hope you all have a great day."

            "name": "Lynn Martin",
            "content": "Hi, Kyle, this is Lynn Martin. Thanks for the question. So on the elongated sales cycle, if you look at the Fixed Income and Data Services business, we're definitely seeing it abate when you look at the other data services line. As Warren mentioned in his prepared remarks, we've actually been able to take share from some of the larger incumbents as a result of the significant amount of investment that we've made over the past few years in the delivery, in modernizing the tech stack associated with that business. So you're definitely seeing the elongated sales cycle abate there, given the share we're taking. On the fixed income data and analytics side of the business, we still see some of the effects of the elongated sales cycle. But importantly, what you're seeing is we are taking share in our End of Day Pricing business. We're continuing to take share there. We're continuing to see good growth in some of the smaller line items that make up that overall line item, including the Index business, which, as Warren said in his prepared remarks, is now about $526 billion in AUM benchmarked against it and some of the products that really go along with the trend of automation. So let me just unpack that a little bit. If you look at the big buzz word of the year in the industry, it's really been around the development and implementation of large language models. We're seeing good demand for, and as Warren mentioned in his prepared remarks, the adoption of our proprietary large language models. And you're seeing the effects of that come through in not just our other data services line and the revenue attributed to that line, but you're also starting to see that in other parts of our segments, including the energy trading side of our segment. Additionally, those large language models in a different asset class are what feeds things around fixed income automation, which is a trend that we continue to be uniquely positioned to capitalize on. So products like continuous evaluated pricing, smaller line item but it continues to see outsized growth relative to the other portions of the fixed income data and analytics side of the business. And because of the strength in that part of the business, you're seeing that bleed into the ICE bond execution side of the business, which outpaced the industry in spite of muted volatility in our core muni markets because of share gains due to that automation, the transparency provided by our data as well as the adoption of institutional customers for these services across not just our muni products but also our REITs, our money market products and importantly, starting to see it in our credit products. So overall, we feel really good about how we're positioned. We're not seeing anything in terms of share erosion. On the contrary, we're continuing to see share gains in our core business, but we still are seeing the effects of the elongated sales cycle really in the End of Day Pricing business, which is causing slightly slower growth. Hi. This is Lynn again. That's a great question. So a couple of areas as you think about where the yield profile continues to lead. Obviously, the attractive yields in treasuries more recently is what has really driven some of the outsized gains that I just mentioned on the execution side of the business for the treasury execution business and the money market products that we have. The contrary to that you've seen is on the fixed income index business, where our capture rate, as we talked about on some of the previous calls, tends to be lower on our treasury index business. So AUM continues to grow, but it doesn't have a direct correlation to the revenue growth. It's not a one-to-one relationship. As you're starting to see the issuance profile start to return to normal, you will see that in a reallocation of assets under management to the higher capture indices, that being our credit indices, the muni indices and obviously, with the equity markets doing well, our equity indices. But you'll also start to see that impact our pricing and reference data end-of-day business because you will start to see new fund families emerge, new asset funds emerge, which you've not really seen over the last year. In contrast, over the last year, you've seen \u2013 where it's been particularly tough for the fixed income asset managers, you've seen the number of funds decline. We're starting to see green shoots for the reemergence of new funds being created. So I think you'll see a positive impact on a variety of our line items. But again, this is why we've set up the business in the Fixed Income and Data Services segment, in particular, to be an all-weather name to benefit from a variety of macro trends. So treasuries do well. That's going to impact the segment in one way. If munis do well, it's going to impact the segment in another way. Yes. This is Lynn again. That's a great question. It's actually a topic we love talking about. So we've had the existence of large language models in our ICE Chat offering for quite some time now. We started with the early stages of it, I'd probably say about a decade ago. But it's really been refined over the last, call it, five years. It's become a contributor though to the energy markets across asset classes, across oil, across gas and across \u2013 starting to impact the utilities as well. Effectively, what it does is it allows for automation. It knows if you and I are talking about the fact that today is Thursday or it knows if we're talking about a trade idea through those models. If it detects a trade idea, it will allow for the seamless transmission of that trade to our clearinghouses and our trading platforms. Additionally, it will give you some fair value analytics and additional metrics around it to allow you to perform that trade with confidence that you're getting a good price. So it's really helping the trader to automate the workflow. It's why it's gained popularity, particularly over the last couple of years as those models have gotten smarter as the technology has improved, quite honestly. But I think we're still in the early stages of this. It's still a small contributor to our volumes, but it's something we're incredibly excited about the potential for not just in energy, but if you think about the rest of the Fixed Income and Data Services segment for fixed income where fixed income markets are desperately requiring automation. So we think this \u2013 the concept has applicability pretty much across all of the markets that we operate, but we're seeing the early-stage benefits in the energy markets, as Warren mentioned in his prepared remarks. Yes. This is Lynn. Thanks for the question. So traditionally, on the execution side, we've operated in the \u2013 our core market's really been the muni market. Now I think what's really encouraging about this quarter is you saw strong growth from us even though the muni markets have had muted volatility, muted activity this quarter. And I think that's really been attributable to the fact that we really have spent the last couple of years building out our distribution framework and focusing on building our distribution framework and getting access to the institutional users, but also continuing to gain share in retail and wealth. So despite the fact that the muni markets have been quieter in Q2 than over the last year, we were able to gain share, continue to gain share in the retail and wealth side of the business. Now importantly, because we had done the development efforts and the integration efforts into the institutional side of the business, the treasury markets, which had a much more attractive yield profile, were able to have outsized results, which drove the growth in this quarter, which you saw that coming from not just retail and wealth segments, but also the institutional side of the business. And as you noted, we have made significant investments in the technology because the distribution has been there into the institutional side of the business in addition to the traditional wealth and retail side of the business. When we upgraded the technology to perform our sweeps as we announced earlier this week, we've been able to start to gain a bit of share on the corporate side of the business, U.S. corporates in particular, particularly investment-grade over the last few months. Now that's still very early days, but we're optimistic because of the investments that we have made in the platform not just on the technology side, but also building the distribution over the last couple of months and doing it on a market-by-market basis."

[Operator Instructions] I will now hand over to your host, Katia Gonzalez, Manager of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nKatia Gonzalez: Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2023 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of the ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2023 Form 10-Q, and other filings with the SEC. In addition, as we announced last year, ICE has agreed to acquire Black Knight. The transaction is still pending customary regulatory approval and we expect to close in the second half of this year. In connection with the proposed transaction, ICE has filed with the SEC a registration statement on Form S-4 to register the shares of ICE common stock to be issued in connection with the transaction. The registration statement includes a proxy statement of Black Knight that also constitutes a prospectus of ICE. Please see the Form S-4 filing for additional information regarding the transaction. In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the equivalent GAAP terms in the earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of our earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. While Lynn is not able to join today\u2019s call, as she is participating in our large IPO being conducted at the NYSE, with us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer and Ben Jackson, President.  I'll now turn the call over to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks, Katya. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today.  I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our first quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share $1.41 was driven by net revenues of $1.9 billion, including record exchange revenues and record fixed income and data service revenues, which increased 12% year-over-year.  First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million, $5 million below the low end of our guidance range, driven by timing of professional services fees and technology spend. This strong performance helped to drive an adjusted operating margin of 51% and record adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion.  Looking to the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $763 million to $773 million with a sequential increase driven by the full quarter impact of 2023 merit increases, as well as strategic investments in technology and growth initiatives across our business.  Now let\u2019s move to Slide 5, where I\u2019ll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. First quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.1 billion. Transaction revenues was $739 million were driven in part by 15% growth in agricultural commodities, and a 16% increase in our global natural gas business.  Importantly, open interest trends remains strong across Futures and Options as of the end of April, including 6% growth in global energy, and 17% growth and Ag. It's worth noting that on May 1, we implemented select price increases within our energy business capturing a portion of the substantial value we have brought to the asset class over the last decade through both continuous product innovation and technology enhancements.  Depending on the mix of volumes, we would expect the benefits of our energy RPC, beginning with the second quarter. Recurring revenues, which include our Exchange Data Services and our NYSE Listings business increased by 5% year-over-year including 8% growth in Exchange Data Services, which was in part driven by double-digit growth and a number of customers consuming or Global Energy and Environmental Data.  This was partially offset by slower growth in our Listings business, where industry-wide capital markets activity continued to be relatively muted. It's worth noting that despite the current environment, the IPO backlog continues to grow and another eight companies elected to transfer the NYSE through April closing on a record year for transfers in 2022.  Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our fixed income and Data Services segment. First quarter revenues totaled a record $563 million, up 12% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 54% including a 106% growth in ICE bonds and 42% percent growth our CDS Clearing system.  Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was driven by market volatility, higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platform. Excluding the impacts of the Euronext migration, recurring revenues grew by 4% driven by additional capacity on the ICE Global Network, as well as strong growth across our Analytics and Desktop offerings with strong demand from energy and environmental-focused customers.  This performance is a key driver of our other Data and Network Services business, which increased by 8% in the first quarter and 10% excluding the impact of Euronext. Similar to last quarter, we experienced an extended sales cycle within our End of Day Pricing business, as well as pressure in asset-based revenues and our Index business, which declined year-over-year as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets in 2022 such as equities, and corporate bonds and into munis and Tributary ETFs.  Let's go to Slide 7 where I\u2019ll discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. First quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $236 million. Recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly 70% of segment revenues totaled $165 million and grew 6% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continued to help drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% percent decline in origination volumes. While nearly two-thirds of our Encompass customers that came up for renewal during the quarter did so at higher minimum helping to drive year-over-year and sequential growth in recurring revenues, it was somewhat offset by increased pressure from customers electing to renew at lower levels.  Importantly, the vast majority of these customers remain on the Encompass and ICE Mortgage Technology platform. While we expect to continue to have outperform the industry, if current cyclical conditions persists we would expect recurring revenues to be towards the lower end of our mid-to-high-single-digit guidance range for the year.  These same cyclical conditions and cost pressures are also increasingly attracting customers that have not traditionally been on the Encompass platform. This is best evidence by our first signing of a top five global banks during the quarter electing to replace their legacy in-house loan origination technology. While not expected to impact 2023, recurring revenues this helped to drive the best quarter for new sales of Encompass in the product\u2019s history and is a clear testament to the increasing need for workflow efficiencies and another example of the synergy opportunities that exists for ICE across the mortgage industry.  In summary, we delivered another quarter of revenue, operating income, and free cash flow growth. We continue to make strategic investments across our business, and future profitable growth opportunities and we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers, and create value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take questions during Q&A, but for I\u2019ll now hand it over to Ben. \nBenjamin Jackson: Thank you Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Amidst a very Dynamic macro environment, including a shock to the banking sector, our customers continue to rely on our leading technology, mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to navigate these uncertain conditions.  This contributed to our all-time highest single volume day of 14.5 million contracts across our markets on March 13. Along with this, we also achieved record options volumes across our commodities in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year. As seen historically, options contracts are an efficient and valuable tool in highly uncertain market conditions.  In our interest rate markets, Central Bank activity, and banking concerns led to increased hedging activity, driving 18% percent volume growth in the first quarter. This growth was underpinned by a 25% volume increase in our Euribor contracts including record Futures volumes. We also had record volumes in our SONIA contract, up 12% year-over-year.  This strong performance is a testament to the strength of our multi-currency multi-benchmark offering across interest rates. Across our Global Energy markets, how energy is produced and consumed has evolved rapidly. Importantly, we have continuously invested alongside this evolution building a global platform that today is one of the most diverse and liquid energy marketplaces in the world.  This platform has established benchmarks in emerging markets across every source of energy. And with record energy options in the first quarter, up 21%, year-over-year and energy open interest up 6% through the end of April, we are pleased that our customers continue to turn to our deep liquid market to manage their risk.  In our oil markets, we've invested in building a global platform that positions us well to provide the critical price transparency, across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate the clean energy transition. Today, the resilience and liquidity of ICE\u2019s Brent benchmark has surpassed other oil benchmarks in both volume and open interest and at the same time, reached an all-time high in Options market share.  This demonstrates that the market depends on the Brent benchmark\u2019s ability to reflect global fundamentals. Importantly, Brent stands as the cornerstone of a franchise spanning key price benchmarks across Gasoil, WTI, Platts Dubai, and more recently Murban.  Together, these benchmarks form the foundation of a cohesive web of more than 700 related oil products such as vocational, product, and refining spreads. In the last few years, we've also invested in biofuels and renewable oil products, such as RINs, RVOs, biofuels, and low carbon fuel standard products and while small today, we see positive signs that these will become meaningful contributors in the future.  Importantly, driven by the breadth of our commercial customer base we have become the natural home for liquidity in these products with open interest in our oil complex of 5% year-over-year through the end of April.  In our natural gas markets, we've adopted a similar playbook, building a global platform that spans benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia, a thoughtful approach that positions us well to benefit from both the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets. This has also helped us drive a 10% increase in global gas volumes in the first quarter.  This includes a 14% growth in our North American Gas business, which not only benefited from continued commercial engagement in our Henry Hub contract, but also our North American bases markets.  In our environmental markets, we\u2019ve recognized the importance of carbon price transparency over 10 years ago, acquiring the Climate Exchange 2010. As we look out over the longer-term, corporates and market participants remain committed to Environmental Policy to reduce carbon emissions as illustrated by a record number of market participants in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year.  In summary, as the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties, and volatilities to energy markets, our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas, and power markets provide the critical price transparency that will enable participants to navigate this evolution. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business, our comprehensive platform continued to generate compounding revenue growth and delivered another quarter of record revenues up 12% year-over-year. This strong growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenues, a testament to the strategic diversification of our business model and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments.  Rising market uncertainty and interest rates, as well, as continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bonds platforms provided significant tailwinds for ICE bonds, which was up over 100% year-over-year. We're also beginning to see return on the investments we've made in both enhanced content and functionality across our other Data, and Network Services business.  This part of our business increased 8% in the first quarter, driven by demand for additional capacity on the ICE Global Network, our private cloud, as well as strong growth across our analytics and desktop offerings. As we move forward, there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand and evolve the products and services within our Fixed Income and Data Services business.  From the digitization of fixed income workflow to the innovations we bring to connectivity and market data, ICE is well positioned for long-term success and growth.  Turning now to our Mortgage business, in the first quarter, we once again outperformed the broader industry, driven by strong recurring revenues of 6% year-over-year. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry.  Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our Origination Technology and Data and Analytics business. While still in the early days of this transition, we continue to see strong clients adoption.  Importantly, as customers increasingly seek efficiencies across a very manual process, our leading Origination Technology known as Encompass provides valuable digital solutions that can reduce both the time and cost required to originate a loan.  We are pleased to see the value of our offering continues to resonate with lenders and this is highlighted by the fact that we had record new sales in our Encompass offering in the first quarter, and the sales success included for the first time a Top 5, global bank electing to replace their legacy in-house loan origination technology for their retail business.  This is a testament to the trust and strong relationships ICE has established with our customers since our founding. Additionally, the recent exit of a largest correspondent lender in the country that was not on Encompass, presents opportunities for lenders that are on Encompass. This focus on automation and efficiencies also contributed to a 10% growth in our Data and Analytics business.  Through our AIQ offering, customers can leverage our analytics such as our credit and income analyzers, as well as leverage or automated document recognition and data extraction technology to reduce the manual stare and compare work that exists across the mortgage workflow today. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity.  The continued growth in our recurring revenues is a testament to the demand we're seeing for these digital solutions. As these new customers come on to our network, we benefit from new subscription revenues and have the opportunity to expand the customer relationship over time as they adopt additional solutions. Just as we've seen in our other markets, this flywheel effect is what we believe will drive compounding growth in our recurring revenues and gives us confidence that we can grow a business that today is only a fraction of the $10 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeff Sprecher : Thank you, Ben. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 9. I'll begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. Since the initial announcement in May of 2022, ICE has remained unwavering in its belief and commitment to the combination of our companies.  In March, we announced revised terms of our merger agreement to acquire Black Knight at $75 per share or a market value of $11.7 billion from our previous terms of $85 per share. Black Knight\u2019s shareholders approved this revised deal last week.  In addition, and although ICE strongly believes that acquiring Black Knight is entirely pro-competitive. We also announced an agreement to sell Black Knight\u2019s Empower loan origination system, plus certain related businesses to Constellation Software Inc. We did this in order to remove a perceived horizontal competition concern.  The divestiture transaction is subject to the closing of ICE\u2019s acquisition of Black Knight and other customary closing conditions. ICE and Black Knight intend to defend the pro-consumer merits of our revised merger in Federal District Court. A scheduling hearing is scheduled to take place on May 12th to establish the timetable for this process, after which time we'll have a better ability to discuss the calendar for deal completion.  We're unable to answer any questions on this call relating to our transaction with Black Knight. We remain fully confident in our position and we look forward to presenting it in court. Importantly, we're very excited about the value and the efficiencies that the combined entities will bring to the end-consumer, as well as other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem.  Shifting to our strong results, the first quarter was highlighted by record adjusted operating results that include continued compounding recurring revenue growth across all three business segments, along with record revenues and our Exchanged and Fixed Income and Data Services businesses.  Remarkably, we did this against last year's exceptional first quarter with its unprecedented volatility driven largely by the onset of conflict in the Ukraine. These strong first quarter results are a testament to the value of our data and technology and the strength of our strategic business model. Over the past 20 years, ICE has continually evolved to meet the needs of our customers, resulting in value for our stockholders. Our evolution has been intentional, diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues.  The compounding growth of our subscription-based services combined with our diverse transaction- based businesses means that our growth is not tied to one economic cycle to one geography or to one asset class. This provides upside exposure while hedging our downside risk.  Looking to the balance of the year and beyond, we\u2019re excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us and we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers, while driving compounding growth for our stockholders.  Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to say thank you to our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to say thank you to my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to another good quarter.  And with that, I'll turn the call now, back to our moderator Laura and will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]  Our first question comes from Rich Repetto from Piper Sandler. Rich, please go ahead. \nRichard Repetto: Yeah, good morning, Jeff and Ben and Warren. Congrats on the second best revenue quarter and EPS quarter in the company's history. So, I'd like to go back to the origin, being energy and I know Ben, you spent a lot of time on it. But still the quarter-over-quarter, or at least excuse me - the comparisons compared to the second quarter of last year improved dramatically for you, they are down 20% last second quarter versus the first quarter.  So, I guess, the question is, then and you just put in a price increase is what could derail the strong - looking more out at the just energy market overall we know what you're doing with Options in the open interest, but what's the outlook for volumes and what could derail this positive setup you got to deliver for the remainder of the year here, but it looks like a positive set up?\nBenjamin Jackson : Thanks, Rich, and hey, this is this Ben. Thanks for the good questions and the commentary there. The - simply said, the setup couldn't be better for the balance of this year. When we look at the health of our overall markets, I mean we've as you alluded to in your comments, we\u2019ve built this business with a long lens and if you towards what customers risk management needs are across the entire energy spectrum including helping to help our clients navigate to a cleaner energy world and through our environmental markets that we've invested heavily in.  And the setup just couldn't be better. If you look at right now, we're at or near an average daily volume market share high against any of our peers in crude and in oil or at or near open interest, market share highs in North American gas and global gas.  We\u2019re at or near revenue share highs in energy. We had record energy options volume in Q1 posted an all-time high for Brent versus WTI Options share versus our peers. We had record active market participation in our environmental markets and our TTF gas, as well as, we're at or near record to data subscribers in several markets.  And this positioning also is underpinning our ability as Warren said in his prepared remarks around the growth in our desktops business in Energy and Environmentals, we have this flywheel effect, but we're also seeing some nice growth in our Fixed Income and Data Services business in this area. So, why are we seeing all this?  Last year, you had the war in Ukraine. This unfortunate war that created all these supply shocks across European energy markets create a very difficult trading environment. We continued to look at the health of the market by active market participation and market data subscribers and we didn't see that shrink. In fact, we saw it grow.  And look at where we are today with US for example, US oil, and LNG backfilling a lot of the supplies that have been cut off from Russia. We are starting to see the market normalize. And that has driven since the end of the year. TTFs open interest growth of 40%, since year-end. Gas oils come roaring back. Now that it's clear that Russian oil is not going to be in gas oil deliveries as of the beginning of this year.  That's up over 30% since year-end. Energy options are up close to 20%. Our Brent benchmarks are doing very well, up 18% since the end of this year. And now you have WTI Midland-grade oil coming into Brent this summer, mostly priced by our Midland WTI American Gulf Coast contracts. We\u2019re well, positioned there.  And then the other market that we saw that had some headwinds last year was our EUA markets or European Union Allowance markets, because there were so much time attention and capital being put towards energy. We saw that come back strong with average daily volume up 18%, Q1 versus Q4. And there's long-term secular growth drivers for that EUA business where there's roughly 4 Gigatons of carbon emissions that are emitted in Europe.  Today, about one-and-a-half Gigatons of those carbon emissions are priced by compliance markets based on policies that are in place. In over the next few years, as a new program, called Fit for 55 comes into place, another one and a half Gigatons will be priced as roads, buildings and maritime sectors of the economies start to get pulled into this, which is all a long-term secular growth driver for that.  So we feel very, very well set up for the balance of the year and beyond, \nRichard Repetto: Okay, thank you very much, Ben and team. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. Kyle, please go ahead. \nKyle Voigt: Hi, good morning. You noted the top five global bank win replaced their in-house solutions with Encompass. I guess, is there any way to frame the revenue upside or the potential revenue upside from that contract? And then in terms of, kind of Tier one size banks, do you think getting this signing could kind of open the door to other opportunities of this size? And if you come out on the pipeline from kind of that that client segment of the larger banks? Thank you. \nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks Kyle. This is Ben. So if you remember last quarter, I had highlighted that the fourth quarter of \u201822 was the strongest sales in terms of new sales to new Encompass customers of all of 2022. And then we followed it up with Q1 of this year, being the strongest new sales in Encompass to new customers of all time. So we feel great about really the hypothesis that we had when we, few years ago, bought the Ellie Mae business, that you had a lot of banks that had aging in-house infrastructure that they were trying to support.  And we felt that that replacement cycle was going to be coming up as that's the main competitor that we have in the Encompass marketplaces is in-house legacy infrastructure. And as we've seen that funnel develop, I alluded to it on the first - on our last call that we saw a strong funnel of these types of banks that we\u2019re talking to and engage with and talking about the benefits that Encompass can provide them, anyway and lo and behold we brought on board one of the biggest global banks onto the platform here in the first quarter.  So, we - these customers, I need to point out are large. They are complex businesses. It's going to take time to implement them. So, in terms of timing and when we will see revenue contribution, it's more likely going to start to come in, in 2024. But, again, we believe that based on the hypothesis that we had clients are going to be replacing this in-house infrastructure, as well as the relationships that ICE has established, the long-term relationships that we've established since our founding, being a trusted technology and infrastructure provider for financial institutions like this, and we\u2019re very well positioned to win this business as other banks look and making the same decisions. \nKyle Voigt: Thanks Ben. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Alex, please go ahead. \nAlex Kramm : Yeah, hey guys. Good morning. Just going back to energy for a second and being more specific here. You mentioned the pricing increase, maybe I've missed it. Obviously, we can look at your disclosures in terms of the fee schedule. But there's a lot of mix here. So, maybe on a like-for-like basis, maybe look at 1Q volume mix, like how much would the pricing changes actually impact RPC or revenue? \nWarren Gardiner: Hey Alex. It\u2019s Warren. So, good question. So, I'd expect a few pennies of impact all of equal. What we did there was we touched a handful of products within energy. And so, when I say, a few pennies I am talking about the Energy RPC overall of course. And so we touched a handful of contracts within the broader energy complex.  We have - this is something we haven't done in some cases, decades it's into in other cases ever. As you know, our philosophy is really to take the approach of where we created value for our customers and then over time go capture some of that value. And so, we felt like this was a good opportunity given the backdrop to do that in some of these contracts. And that\u2019s what you're seeing there.  And so, hey look, what we've done that in the past, we're always looking to do that and we'll continue to look for those opportunities not only within Futures, but really across the business and taking that that same philosophy as we go forward here, so. So, hopefully that's helpful in terms of thinking about the impacts. \nAlex Kramm : You can't put it in percentage terms, can you? Or could you? \nWarren Gardiner: Well, I would just say, look, the energy RPC was at $1.60 in the quarter I would say a few pennies on top of that, that should help you in terms of thinking about the impact. \nAlex Kramm : I was looking for exact math, but good enough. Thank you. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Dan, please go ahead. \nDaniel Fannon : Thanks. Good morning. So, I guess, another question for you, Warren. You talked about strategic investments and that's part of the pickup sequentially. And I was hoping you could just frame where those investments are going in this year, kind of projects and/or products. And then, if the environment isn't as constructive as we think about the back half of the year, is there some flex to maybe remove or reduce spend across the expense base? \nWarren Gardiner : Yes, that\u2019s good question. So, in terms of some of the investments we\u2019re making, we're making those across technology. We're also making some select hires in certain areas, particularly areas within some of our data products, new data sets, ESG indices. We\u2019re expanding some of the opportunities we have within the connectivity business.  So it's fairly broad based in terms of those Investments we\u2019re making. And that's all part of the plan, if you will, or the budget when we enter the year. As we talked a little bit, or I talked a little bit earlier about in my prepared remarks about how so we did have some expenses pushed into the second quarter. So we're, as I'm noting now, we're going to continue to make those investments and we're on plan to do that.  Look, over time, of course, and the goal every year is to grow both in the near and the long-term. And to do that, we've got to make investments in the business, particularly, if we're going to grow into the future, and that's what we're going to, and what we're doing here. And that's what you should expect us to continue to do. And that's frankly, that's the benefit of that we have with the diversified model.  We had not only across asset classes but also the mix of subscription it tends to be a little more resilient. And then and then as well as on the diversified transaction front. So, that's what we'll do and I think look, as we're thinking about how things trend through the balance of the year, look, we're a company that's run pretty efficiently. We had operating margins of 61% in the quarter.  That's been a philosophy that we've had to operate that way and look to run the business efficiently, both in good times and bad times or tough times. And so, I don't think you should expect us to really be changing how are we thinking about that. And so we're going to make those investments. And to the extent we need it to pull back, we will think about that.  But I think it would have to be more of a structural change in the in some of the asset classes that we\u2019re in and then anything is difficult, because again we want to drive long-term growth. And there's no reason for us sitting here today that to do that, because we're not seeing that at the moment. \nDaniel Fannon : Okay. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Bond from Rosenblatt Securities. Andrew, please go ahead. \nAndrew Bond: Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask this is there any change to your thoughts in ICE\u2019s strategy into digital assets base in the recent months? Are there attritional changes to come more active and given the impact of the current banking crisis in other countries, where ICE already has worked with regulators stepping up their efforts to really become crypto hub for the US bills are also behind. And additionally, do you think US Government and regulators are making a mistake by not being more proactive in providing thoughtful regulatory clarity in place? Thanks. \nJeff Sprecher : This is Jeff. So, we sort of have our point in two places with respect to digital assets. First of all, we created Back and then spun it out as its own public company. And while I can't speak for Back management, the philosophy that we put into the company at the time of the spin was to be highly regulated.  In other words, to get 50 state money transmitter licenses and set up a custodial banking practice under the New York Banking Regulations. And so, from the onset, I would say, we had the philosophy that anything we did around digital assets should be, should comport to existing regulation. The - we own and operate the world's largest exchange, The New York Stock Exchange, 350 billion transactions a day.  And we have the infrastructure to list digital assets. It is different than a lot of the entrepreneurs in the digital space in that a requirement of the US Securities Exchange is that its members have to be licensed broker/dealers. So there is no such thing as NYSE Direct. It's not that we couldn't build NYSE Direct. It's not that we don't have relationships with end-users.  But the law says that that end-users need to come through broker/dealers who provide KYC and AML oversight to the market. And so, so far that model hasn't been one that the market has been interested in. But our ability to list a digital asset is actually quite easy. It's obviously a token and registering on a public blockchain is actually relatively simple given the complexity of the infrastructure that we're used to operate in.  So, we'll see how this unfolds. It does appear that the SEC and other regulators would prefer to use that traditional infrastructure for tokens in the United States and a lot of their compliance activities seem to be focused on moving the existing market towards our model and the historical model. And to the extent that there's an appetite for us it would be easy for us to list digital assets. And we obviously have the domain knowledge here having built back on how to operate in a public blockchain environment. \nAndrew Bond: Okay. Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Cyprys from Morgan Stanley. Michael, please go ahead. \nMichael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. Good morning. So, just a question on mortgage. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about where you guys are along the journey of digitizing the mortgage process from e-Closings to e-Notes. It seems, you have a lot of capabilities already in place. Maybe it's just about driving engagement from here. So, if you could talk about what's left? What are some of the hurdles that you're facing? What are some of the steps that you're taking to overcome those hurdles and to accelerate the push the digitize the marketplace? Thank you. \nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks Michael. It's Ben. The short answer to the question is, we have done a really good job of integrating the businesses that we've acquired over the last few years from MERS to the Simplifile business to then the Ellie Mae business really bringing together from the start of the origination process all the way through to the electronic closing of the loan.  We have integrated those into a cohesive platform for our clients. And it's you alluded to, we've stood up an electronic closing room for our clients to digitize the close. We have e-Notes now as part of the Encompass document set native into our loan origination system. So we're really set up well to be able to cross-sell the solution set into all of our clients.  That's the thing I think most important for people to really when they're thinking about the mortgage headwinds, and the current conditions in the marketplace is and I think Warren mentioned this in his comments in his prepared remarks that we're not losing clients. And of the 6,000 lenders that are out there we're providing some services to just about every one of them.  3,000 of those lenders are on our Encompass platform. So we're very, very well positioned to now cross-sell these solutions to our clients. So, right now, what we've been what we've been really focused on and that we've completed that that integration is executing on the sales success that we've had. We've talked about the strong funnel that we've had and bringing new clients into the Encompass ecosystem.  I think the other thing to point out as you see, some of the some of the noise in our results is for people to fully appreciate that when we have renewals that are coming through our process, just like we did last quarter, more than 60% of the clients that renewed at higher subscription fees then where they, where they started at the beginning of that quarter.  What we're trading off for that is a per-close loan fee. We're lowering that to some degree, which is transaction revenue. So, of the clients that did not renew at higher subscription and perhaps went down in subscription, there the trade-off is consistently that we're raising the per-close loan fee on those clients, which means that as the market rebounds and returns, we have an opportunity to participate in the upside there.  So it's important that people see that one, we're not losing customers. Two, we are very well positioned to cross-sell the entire digital solution suite that you alluded to in the way that you asked the question. And we're set up very well with that balance between transaction and subscription revenue where if clients are in tough times and they need to reduce their subscriptions, we can participate in the upside in transaction revenue. \nJeff Sprecher: I\u2019d also \u2013 this is Jeff. I\u2019d also tell you that, one of the things we're seeing is much like it came out of the dotcom boom, where, there were thousands of tech companies and that then really reduced down to a core group of companies that emerged as the largest companies in the United States today. And the reason is similar to the environment were in today, is that in tougher periods like we're in right now, with mortgage, within a higher interest rate environment, clients are more apt to talk to us and listen to our pitch about changing their behavior that they're looking for cost efficiencies.  A couple of years ago, when the market was at its peak in terms of transaction volume and everybody's busy in making money, it's actually hard in an environment to convince people to change their behavior. But our team has been really seeing a lot more success now in this environment with people focused on the new model that we\u2019re bringing, as Ben mentioned, a subscription, SaaS-based model that that has deep connectivity across the mortgage ecosystem that will allow them to save money and ultimately pass those lower costs on to consumers. And so, it's actually a pretty good environment for us to try to advance a different model across the industry. \nMichael Cyprys : Great. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Craig, please go ahead. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Good morning, Jeff. Warren. Hope everyone\u2019s is doing well. My question is on disposition potential. ICE has always been pretty opportunistic in terms of buying businesses to make strategic sense and sometimes selling ones too. But are you looking any businesses today that may not make strategic sense or its upscale or maybe would be even more valuable to another party.  And I'm partly thinking about your fixed income execution business, which you maybe with upscale, but it's within a great fixed income franchise. It's benefiting from both bond ETF adoption and the migration to e-trading. \nJeff Sprecher: That's a really good question actually. I don't want to focus on specifically our fixed income business, but let me speak broadly. And the answer is, yes. I feel like as a management team, we promise that we're going to deliver growth. And sometimes we can do that by building new technologies as we just talked about in mortgage.  Sometimes we do it by acquisition and sometimes, it's better to do dispositions and reallocate the capital. And, and I think, through the history of this management team, we've not been afraid to spin businesses out. We've obviously acquired a lot of businesses and we're good at integrating businesses. It's actually pretty strong domain capability of this company. But we also are good at organizing businesses and spinning them out.  Ben oversaw along with some Black Knight people, the ability to put together their loan origination platform and take it to market. So, we're not afraid to move businesses around if there's value there. The other thing I would say to you is that, if the market doesn't appreciate of the overall footprint of ICE, it's you as an investor and an investor advocate, think that some of the parts would be better organized differently. Then as a management team, we should be open to that. We like actually running smaller, flatter businesses that have entrepreneurial bents to them. And so the complexity of being a large organization actually can sometimes frustrate that.  And so maybe unlike many management teams, we like being small and nimble. So, a longwinded answer of saying, yeah, we look at everything. And we do meet routinely all the people on this call. We meet routinely to go through all of our business units. And what our competitors are doing, what the landscape is and think about whether there are opportunities to organize differently. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you, Jeff. \nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UPS. Alex, please go ahead. \nAlex Kramm: Yeah, hey back so soon. Just a quick one on the Fixed Income and Data business. On the Fixed Income Data, recurring revenues in particular, I know there's a couple moving pieces here for the flat growth year-over-year. But now, if you think somatic and you step back right? Fixed income markets are in a position of strength for the first time in \u2013 I don\u2019t know, 15 years or so. And people are getting excited about all these changes and flows into CDs and whatever is happening out there that we haven't seen in so long. Systematically, I don't understand, like, why this is not helping the business more. Or do you think there's still some things going to the come, because it just seem like there's been a period of uninvestment and as Fixed Income managers now have you no more strength, I would assume that they're looking to to modernize some of their solutions? \nWarren Gardiner: Hey, Alex. This is Warren. I think you make some really good points and I would echo those. I think right now, though, in terms of our business and the customers that were facing, they are still licking their wounds little bit from what was a pretty tough 2022. But as you're alluding to, there are some green shoots if you will I mean, we've had some good Fixed Income flows for the first couple months of the year.  I don't want to predict anything. But it kind of feels like at least relatively speaking, you've got some stabilization in interest rates. And then - and as you said earlier, I mean, this all of a sudden becomes a pretty attractive asset class, broadly speaking. And so, look, I think, there are customers right now, and we've seen this, when I talk about sales cycle, things like net new fund growth and things like that.  Though that's part of the slower sales cycle, that's a component of our growth. But as you know, we just said and you said it too, like it seems like things are getting or stabilizing a little bit, and you've got a potentially very attractive asset class. So we're encouraged by that. And I think as we look to the second half, we do have some easier compares to that were facing.  And I think all \u2013 if you pull that all together, it's all pretty encouraging. But also I think, don't lose sight of what's going on in the rest of the Data business. So we talked about it too. I mean, other Data and Network Services, we had some really strong growth in our desktop business, up double-digits. Our strong growth in our Analytics business.  Within that, in part driven by some of the commodity customers. It's also helping our Exchange Data business. And so, we've had some pretty good results and that's the benefit of having some diversity across different types of solutions in different asset classes and helping to drive what overall for the segment was another good quarter of double-digit growth and margin expansion.  And again sort of a testament to the not only the old weather nature of that particular segment, but really the business overall. \nAlex Kramm: Okay. Fair enough. And then, since we are in over time I'm going to squeeze one quick one in there, for Ben. Ben you mentioned the Data and Analytics in mortgage as a sign of area of strength, but sequentially that business was actually down a decent chunk. So, I don't know if there is seasonality, but just making sure that people are not also, trading down there or getting rid of some services that they've been have purchased in the past. \nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks Alex. So, while you did allude - you alluded to the slowdown in the business, you got to look at it as well though. It is up 10% against a market that\u2019s sequentially down 20 and year-over-year down 60. So the backdrop is still tough.  Historically, when you go back to when we bought the Ellie Mae business, this business was heavily transaction-oriented. So that's why if you look over time each quarter the results in this business has been a little bit volatile, because we've been just like on the origination side, we have made a concerted move to moving more and more customers towards subscription.  In the fourth quarter, and then again in the first quarter, we moved some pretty substantial customers that were on heavily transaction-oriented deals more towards subscription and gave up some transaction revenue to do so. So that's some of the noise that you saw in there. But some of the tailwinds we have in this business, as well as within the spring of last year, we mentioned we won a major global bank in JPMorgan Chase coming onto our AIQ platform.  And we have now implemented them. They are live and we're going to start seeing revenue contribution from that. So there's a nice tailwind there. We also - based on the interesting data sets that we have and the unique datasets that we have on our loan origination system, we've recently been engaged by the CFPB. And they've engaged us to help improve their average prime lending rate.  So the lending rates that they put out to consumers, that's the average to give them a benchmark of am I getting a fair deal? When we're underwriting a loan, they've engaged us to help provide them our data to help improve that index. So we think that's just one of many examples of data offerings that we will have in the future.  And the other thing I\u2019d point to is that, were feeding a lot of our data sets into other parts of our business. Like our ICE Data Services business to improve our mortgage-backed securities pricing. And then, we also launched those rate lock Futures last year that we believe is a very interesting risk management tool to help with some of the basis risk that you have in the mortgage space when producing a mortgage, whether it's a long-term mortgage lock that you have or you have jumbo loans in your portfolio.  You have pretty significant basis risk versus treasuries and the TDA market when doing that. And in April, we saw 11,000 contracts executed on those rate lock Future. So, there's a lot of green shoots there within data. And I think you'll see that feed multiple different line items in the future as those develop. \nAlex Kramm: Right. Great. Thanks for the follow-ups. \nOperator: Thank you. That is now the end of the Q&A session. We will now hand back over to Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO for closing remarks. \nJeff Sprecher : Well, let me thank you, Lauren for being today's operator and thank you all for joining us this morning. I want to also send out a special thank you to Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler, as many of you know he dialed in very early this morning in order to open today's questioning, as he's done every quarter since our initial public offering in 2005. And we understand that Rich plans to move on to new opportunities this summer.  So I represent everyone in the room when I say that, we will miss hearing his thoughtful questions going forward. And Rich, I just want to say, thank you for your commitment to following our company and our progress. And in your absence, please know that we're going to continue to strive to innovate for our customers and build an all-weather business model that will continue to grow.  With that, have a great day, everyone. Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks, Katya. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today.  I'll begin on Slide 4 with some of the key highlights from our first quarter results. Adjusted earnings per share $1.41 was driven by net revenues of $1.9 billion, including record exchange revenues and record fixed income and data service revenues, which increased 12% year-over-year.  First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $740 million, $5 million below the low end of our guidance range, driven by timing of professional services fees and technology spend. This strong performance helped to drive an adjusted operating margin of 51% and record adjusted operating income of $1.2 billion.  Looking to the second quarter, we expect adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $763 million to $773 million with a sequential increase driven by the full quarter impact of 2023 merit increases, as well as strategic investments in technology and growth initiatives across our business.  Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. First quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.1 billion. Transaction revenues was $739 million were driven in part by 15% growth in agricultural commodities, and a 16% increase in our global natural gas business.  Importantly, open interest trends remains strong across Futures and Options as of the end of April, including 6% growth in global energy, and 17% growth and Ag. It's worth noting that on May 1, we implemented select price increases within our energy business capturing a portion of the substantial value we have brought to the asset class over the last decade through both continuous product innovation and technology enhancements.  Depending on the mix of volumes, we would expect the benefits of our energy RPC, beginning with the second quarter. Recurring revenues, which include our Exchange Data Services and our NYSE Listings business increased by 5% year-over-year including 8% growth in Exchange Data Services, which was in part driven by double-digit growth and a number of customers consuming or Global Energy and Environmental Data.  This was partially offset by slower growth in our Listings business, where industry-wide capital markets activity continued to be relatively muted. It's worth noting that despite the current environment, the IPO backlog continues to grow and another eight companies elected to transfer the NYSE through April closing on a record year for transfers in 2022.  Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our fixed income and Data Services segment. First quarter revenues totaled a record $563 million, up 12% versus a year ago. Transaction revenues increased by 54% including a 106% growth in ICE bonds and 42% percent growth our CDS Clearing system.  Similar to last quarter, this strong growth was driven by market volatility, higher interest rates and our continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bond platform. Excluding the impacts of the Euronext migration, recurring revenues grew by 4% driven by additional capacity on the ICE Global Network, as well as strong growth across our Analytics and Desktop offerings with strong demand from energy and environmental-focused customers.  This performance is a key driver of our other Data and Network Services business, which increased by 8% in the first quarter and 10% excluding the impact of Euronext. Similar to last quarter, we experienced an extended sales cycle within our End of Day Pricing business, as well as pressure in asset-based revenues and our Index business, which declined year-over-year as investors shifted out of higher fee risk assets in 2022 such as equities, and corporate bonds and into munis and Tributary ETFs.  Let's go to Slide 7 where I'll discuss our Mortgage Technology segment. First quarter Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $236 million. Recurring revenues, which accounted for nearly 70% of segment revenues totaled $165 million and grew 6% year-over-year. These strong recurring revenues continued to help drive outperformance versus an industry that experienced a nearly 60% percent decline in origination volumes. While nearly two-thirds of our Encompass customers that came up for renewal during the quarter did so at higher minimum helping to drive year-over-year and sequential growth in recurring revenues, it was somewhat offset by increased pressure from customers electing to renew at lower levels.  Importantly, the vast majority of these customers remain on the Encompass and ICE Mortgage Technology platform. While we expect to continue to have outperform the industry, if current cyclical conditions persists we would expect recurring revenues to be towards the lower end of our mid-to-high-single-digit guidance range for the year.  These same cyclical conditions and cost pressures are also increasingly attracting customers that have not traditionally been on the Encompass platform. This is best evidence by our first signing of a top five global banks during the quarter electing to replace their legacy in-house loan origination technology. While not expected to impact 2023, recurring revenues this helped to drive the best quarter for new sales of Encompass in the product's history and is a clear testament to the increasing need for workflow efficiencies and another example of the synergy opportunities that exists for ICE across the mortgage industry.  In summary, we delivered another quarter of revenue, operating income, and free cash flow growth. We continue to make strategic investments across our business, and future profitable growth opportunities and we are well positioned to meet the evolving needs of our customers, and create value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take questions during Q&A, but for I'll now hand it over to Ben. Hey Alex. It's Warren. So, good question. So, I'd expect a few pennies of impact all of equal. What we did there was we touched a handful of products within energy. And so, when I say, a few pennies I am talking about the Energy RPC overall of course. And so we touched a handful of contracts within the broader energy complex.  We have - this is something we haven't done in some cases, decades it's into in other cases ever. As you know, our philosophy is really to take the approach of where we created value for our customers and then over time go capture some of that value. And so, we felt like this was a good opportunity given the backdrop to do that in some of these contracts. And that's what you're seeing there.  And so, hey look, what we've done that in the past, we're always looking to do that and we'll continue to look for those opportunities not only within Futures, but really across the business and taking that that same philosophy as we go forward here, so. So, hopefully that's helpful in terms of thinking about the impacts. Well, I would just say, look, the energy RPC was at $1.60 in the quarter I would say a few pennies on top of that, that should help you in terms of thinking about the impact. Yes, that's good question. So, in terms of some of the investments we're making, we're making those across technology. We're also making some select hires in certain areas, particularly areas within some of our data products, new data sets, ESG indices. We're expanding some of the opportunities we have within the connectivity business.  So it's fairly broad based in terms of those Investments we're making. And that's all part of the plan, if you will, or the budget when we enter the year. As we talked a little bit, or I talked a little bit earlier about in my prepared remarks about how so we did have some expenses pushed into the second quarter. So we're, as I'm noting now, we're going to continue to make those investments and we're on plan to do that.  Look, over time, of course, and the goal every year is to grow both in the near and the long-term. And to do that, we've got to make investments in the business, particularly, if we're going to grow into the future, and that's what we're going to, and what we're doing here. And that's what you should expect us to continue to do. And that's frankly, that's the benefit of that we have with the diversified model.  We had not only across asset classes but also the mix of subscription it tends to be a little more resilient. And then and then as well as on the diversified transaction front. So, that's what we'll do and I think look, as we're thinking about how things trend through the balance of the year, look, we're a company that's run pretty efficiently. We had operating margins of 61% in the quarter.  That's been a philosophy that we've had to operate that way and look to run the business efficiently, both in good times and bad times or tough times. And so, I don't think you should expect us to really be changing how are we thinking about that. And so we're going to make those investments. And to the extent we need it to pull back, we will think about that.  But I think it would have to be more of a structural change in the in some of the asset classes that we're in and then anything is difficult, because again we want to drive long-term growth. And there's no reason for us sitting here today that to do that, because we're not seeing that at the moment. Hey, Alex. This is Warren. I think you make some really good points and I would echo those. I think right now, though, in terms of our business and the customers that were facing, they are still licking their wounds little bit from what was a pretty tough 2022. But as you're alluding to, there are some green shoots if you will I mean, we've had some good Fixed Income flows for the first couple months of the year.  I don't want to predict anything. But it kind of feels like at least relatively speaking, you've got some stabilization in interest rates. And then - and as you said earlier, I mean, this all of a sudden becomes a pretty attractive asset class, broadly speaking. And so, look, I think, there are customers right now, and we've seen this, when I talk about sales cycle, things like net new fund growth and things like that.  Though that's part of the slower sales cycle, that's a component of our growth. But as you know, we just said and you said it too, like it seems like things are getting or stabilizing a little bit, and you've got a potentially very attractive asset class. So we're encouraged by that. And I think as we look to the second half, we do have some easier compares to that were facing.  And I think all \u2013 if you pull that all together, it's all pretty encouraging. But also I think, don't lose sight of what's going on in the rest of the Data business. So we talked about it too. I mean, other Data and Network Services, we had some really strong growth in our desktop business, up double-digits. Our strong growth in our Analytics business.

And again sort of a testament to the not only the old weather nature of that particular segment, but really the business overall."

            "content": "Thank you Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Amidst a very Dynamic macro environment, including a shock to the banking sector, our customers continue to rely on our leading technology, mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to navigate these uncertain conditions.  This contributed to our all-time highest single volume day of 14.5 million contracts across our markets on March 13. Along with this, we also achieved record options volumes across our commodities in the quarter, up 21% year-over-year. As seen historically, options contracts are an efficient and valuable tool in highly uncertain market conditions.  In our interest rate markets, Central Bank activity, and banking concerns led to increased hedging activity, driving 18% percent volume growth in the first quarter. This growth was underpinned by a 25% volume increase in our Euribor contracts including record Futures volumes. We also had record volumes in our SONIA contract, up 12% year-over-year.  This strong performance is a testament to the strength of our multi-currency multi-benchmark offering across interest rates. Across our Global Energy markets, how energy is produced and consumed has evolved rapidly. Importantly, we have continuously invested alongside this evolution building a global platform that today is one of the most diverse and liquid energy marketplaces in the world.  This platform has established benchmarks in emerging markets across every source of energy. And with record energy options in the first quarter, up 21%, year-over-year and energy open interest up 6% through the end of April, we are pleased that our customers continue to turn to our deep liquid market to manage their risk.  In our oil markets, we've invested in building a global platform that positions us well to provide the critical price transparency, across the energy spectrum that will enable participants to navigate the clean energy transition. Today, the resilience and liquidity of ICE's Brent benchmark has surpassed other oil benchmarks in both volume and open interest and at the same time, reached an all-time high in Options market share.  This demonstrates that the market depends on the Brent benchmark's ability to reflect global fundamentals. Importantly, Brent stands as the cornerstone of a franchise spanning key price benchmarks across Gasoil, WTI, Platts Dubai, and more recently Murban.  Together, these benchmarks form the foundation of a cohesive web of more than 700 related oil products such as vocational, product, and refining spreads. In the last few years, we've also invested in biofuels and renewable oil products, such as RINs, RVOs, biofuels, and low carbon fuel standard products and while small today, we see positive signs that these will become meaningful contributors in the future.  Importantly, driven by the breadth of our commercial customer base we have become the natural home for liquidity in these products with open interest in our oil complex of 5% year-over-year through the end of April.  In our natural gas markets, we've adopted a similar playbook, building a global platform that spans benchmarks across North America, Europe and Asia, a thoughtful approach that positions us well to benefit from both the near-term volatility and the long-term secular growth trends occurring across these markets. This has also helped us drive a 10% increase in global gas volumes in the first quarter.  This includes a 14% growth in our North American Gas business, which not only benefited from continued commercial engagement in our Henry Hub contract, but also our North American bases markets.  In our environmental markets, we've recognized the importance of carbon price transparency over 10 years ago, acquiring the Climate Exchange 2010. As we look out over the longer-term, corporates and market participants remain committed to Environmental Policy to reduce carbon emissions as illustrated by a record number of market participants in the quarter, up 7% year-over-year.  In summary, as the clean energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties, and volatilities to energy markets, our global environmental markets, alongside our global oil, gas, and power markets provide the critical price transparency that will enable participants to navigate this evolution. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business, our comprehensive platform continued to generate compounding revenue growth and delivered another quarter of record revenues up 12% year-over-year. This strong growth was underpinned by both recurring and transaction revenues, a testament to the strategic diversification of our business model and our ability to deliver growth through an array of macroeconomic environments.  Rising market uncertainty and interest rates, as well, as continued efforts to build institutional connectivity to our bonds platforms provided significant tailwinds for ICE bonds, which was up over 100% year-over-year. We're also beginning to see return on the investments we've made in both enhanced content and functionality across our other Data, and Network Services business.  This part of our business increased 8% in the first quarter, driven by demand for additional capacity on the ICE Global Network, our private cloud, as well as strong growth across our analytics and desktop offerings. As we move forward, there is a significant opportunity to continue to expand and evolve the products and services within our Fixed Income and Data Services business.  From the digitization of fixed income workflow to the innovations we bring to connectivity and market data, ICE is well positioned for long-term success and growth.  Turning now to our Mortgage business, in the first quarter, we once again outperformed the broader industry, driven by strong recurring revenues of 6% year-over-year. This continued outperformance is a result of executing against our strategy of leveraging our technology and data expertise to accelerate the analog to digital conversion happening in the industry.  Part of that strategy is intentionally shifting more business to recurring revenue, particularly within our Origination Technology and Data and Analytics business. While still in the early days of this transition, we continue to see strong clients adoption.  Importantly, as customers increasingly seek efficiencies across a very manual process, our leading Origination Technology known as Encompass provides valuable digital solutions that can reduce both the time and cost required to originate a loan.  We are pleased to see the value of our offering continues to resonate with lenders and this is highlighted by the fact that we had record new sales in our Encompass offering in the first quarter, and the sales success included for the first time a Top 5, global bank electing to replace their legacy in-house loan origination technology for their retail business.  This is a testament to the trust and strong relationships ICE has established with our customers since our founding. Additionally, the recent exit of a largest correspondent lender in the country that was not on Encompass, presents opportunities for lenders that are on Encompass. This focus on automation and efficiencies also contributed to a 10% growth in our Data and Analytics business.  Through our AIQ offering, customers can leverage our analytics such as our credit and income analyzers, as well as leverage or automated document recognition and data extraction technology to reduce the manual stare and compare work that exists across the mortgage workflow today. This automation could save lenders thousands of dollars per loan by reducing manufacturing time and complexity.  The continued growth in our recurring revenues is a testament to the demand we're seeing for these digital solutions. As these new customers come on to our network, we benefit from new subscription revenues and have the opportunity to expand the customer relationship over time as they adopt additional solutions. Just as we've seen in our other markets, this flywheel effect is what we believe will drive compounding growth in our recurring revenues and gives us confidence that we can grow a business that today is only a fraction of the $10 billion addressable market that is in the early days of an analog to digital conversion.  With that, I'll now turn the call over to Jeff. Thanks, Rich, and hey, this is this Ben. Thanks for the good questions and the commentary there. The - simply said, the setup couldn't be better for the balance of this year. When we look at the health of our overall markets, I mean we've as you alluded to in your comments, we've built this business with a long lens and if you towards what customers risk management needs are across the entire energy spectrum including helping to help our clients navigate to a cleaner energy world and through our environmental markets that we've invested heavily in.  And the setup just couldn't be better. If you look at right now, we're at or near an average daily volume market share high against any of our peers in crude and in oil or at or near open interest, market share highs in North American gas and global gas.  We're at or near revenue share highs in energy. We had record energy options volume in Q1 posted an all-time high for Brent versus WTI Options share versus our peers. We had record active market participation in our environmental markets and our TTF gas, as well as, we're at or near record to data subscribers in several markets.  And this positioning also is underpinning our ability as Warren said in his prepared remarks around the growth in our desktops business in Energy and Environmentals, we have this flywheel effect, but we're also seeing some nice growth in our Fixed Income and Data Services business in this area. So, why are we seeing all this?  Last year, you had the war in Ukraine. This unfortunate war that created all these supply shocks across European energy markets create a very difficult trading environment. We continued to look at the health of the market by active market participation and market data subscribers and we didn't see that shrink. In fact, we saw it grow.  And look at where we are today with US for example, US oil, and LNG backfilling a lot of the supplies that have been cut off from Russia. We are starting to see the market normalize. And that has driven since the end of the year. TTFs open interest growth of 40%, since year-end. Gas oils come roaring back. Now that it's clear that Russian oil is not going to be in gas oil deliveries as of the beginning of this year.  That's up over 30% since year-end. Energy options are up close to 20%. Our Brent benchmarks are doing very well, up 18% since the end of this year. And now you have WTI Midland-grade oil coming into Brent this summer, mostly priced by our Midland WTI American Gulf Coast contracts. We're well, positioned there.  And then the other market that we saw that had some headwinds last year was our EUA markets or European Union Allowance markets, because there were so much time attention and capital being put towards energy. We saw that come back strong with average daily volume up 18%, Q1 versus Q4. And there's long-term secular growth drivers for that EUA business where there's roughly 4 Gigatons of carbon emissions that are emitted in Europe.  Today, about one-and-a-half Gigatons of those carbon emissions are priced by compliance markets based on policies that are in place. In over the next few years, as a new program, called Fit for 55 comes into place, another one and a half Gigatons will be priced as roads, buildings and maritime sectors of the economies start to get pulled into this, which is all a long-term secular growth driver for that.  So we feel very, very well set up for the balance of the year and beyond, Thanks Kyle. This is Ben. So if you remember last quarter, I had highlighted that the fourth quarter of \u201822 was the strongest sales in terms of new sales to new Encompass customers of all of 2022. And then we followed it up with Q1 of this year, being the strongest new sales in Encompass to new customers of all time. So we feel great about really the hypothesis that we had when we, few years ago, bought the Ellie Mae business, that you had a lot of banks that had aging in-house infrastructure that they were trying to support.  And we felt that that replacement cycle was going to be coming up as that's the main competitor that we have in the Encompass marketplaces is in-house legacy infrastructure. And as we've seen that funnel develop, I alluded to it on the first - on our last call that we saw a strong funnel of these types of banks that we're talking to and engage with and talking about the benefits that Encompass can provide them, anyway and lo and behold we brought on board one of the biggest global banks onto the platform here in the first quarter.  So, we - these customers, I need to point out are large. They are complex businesses. It's going to take time to implement them. So, in terms of timing and when we will see revenue contribution, it's more likely going to start to come in, in 2024. But, again, we believe that based on the hypothesis that we had clients are going to be replacing this in-house infrastructure, as well as the relationships that ICE has established, the long-term relationships that we've established since our founding, being a trusted technology and infrastructure provider for financial institutions like this, and we're very well positioned to win this business as other banks look and making the same decisions. Thanks Michael. It's Ben. The short answer to the question is, we have done a really good job of integrating the businesses that we've acquired over the last few years from MERS to the Simplifile business to then the Ellie Mae business really bringing together from the start of the origination process all the way through to the electronic closing of the loan.  We have integrated those into a cohesive platform for our clients. And it's you alluded to, we've stood up an electronic closing room for our clients to digitize the close. We have e-Notes now as part of the Encompass document set native into our loan origination system. So we're really set up well to be able to cross-sell the solution set into all of our clients.  That's the thing I think most important for people to really when they're thinking about the mortgage headwinds, and the current conditions in the marketplace is and I think Warren mentioned this in his comments in his prepared remarks that we're not losing clients. And of the 6,000 lenders that are out there we're providing some services to just about every one of them.  3,000 of those lenders are on our Encompass platform. So we're very, very well positioned to now cross-sell these solutions to our clients. So, right now, what we've been what we've been really focused on and that we've completed that that integration is executing on the sales success that we've had. We've talked about the strong funnel that we've had and bringing new clients into the Encompass ecosystem.  I think the other thing to point out as you see, some of the some of the noise in our results is for people to fully appreciate that when we have renewals that are coming through our process, just like we did last quarter, more than 60% of the clients that renewed at higher subscription fees then where they, where they started at the beginning of that quarter.  What we're trading off for that is a per-close loan fee. We're lowering that to some degree, which is transaction revenue. So, of the clients that did not renew at higher subscription and perhaps went down in subscription, there the trade-off is consistently that we're raising the per-close loan fee on those clients, which means that as the market rebounds and returns, we have an opportunity to participate in the upside there.  So it's important that people see that one, we're not losing customers. Two, we are very well positioned to cross-sell the entire digital solution suite that you alluded to in the way that you asked the question. And we're set up very well with that balance between transaction and subscription revenue where if clients are in tough times and they need to reduce their subscriptions, we can participate in the upside in transaction revenue. Thanks Alex. So, while you did allude - you alluded to the slowdown in the business, you got to look at it as well though. It is up 10% against a market that's sequentially down 20 and year-over-year down 60. So the backdrop is still tough.  Historically, when you go back to when we bought the Ellie Mae business, this business was heavily transaction-oriented. So that's why if you look over time each quarter the results in this business has been a little bit volatile, because we've been just like on the origination side, we have made a concerted move to moving more and more customers towards subscription.  In the fourth quarter, and then again in the first quarter, we moved some pretty substantial customers that were on heavily transaction-oriented deals more towards subscription and gave up some transaction revenue to do so. So that's some of the noise that you saw in there. But some of the tailwinds we have in this business, as well as within the spring of last year, we mentioned we won a major global bank in JPMorgan Chase coming onto our AIQ platform.  And we have now implemented them. They are live and we're going to start seeing revenue contribution from that. So there's a nice tailwind there. We also - based on the interesting data sets that we have and the unique datasets that we have on our loan origination system, we've recently been engaged by the CFPB. And they've engaged us to help improve their average prime lending rate.  So the lending rates that they put out to consumers, that's the average to give them a benchmark of am I getting a fair deal? When we're underwriting a loan, they've engaged us to help provide them our data to help improve that index. So we think that's just one of many examples of data offerings that we will have in the future.  And the other thing I'd point to is that, were feeding a lot of our data sets into other parts of our business. Like our ICE Data Services business to improve our mortgage-backed securities pricing. And then, we also launched those rate lock Futures last year that we believe is a very interesting risk management tool to help with some of the basis risk that you have in the mortgage space when producing a mortgage, whether it's a long-term mortgage lock that you have or you have jumbo loans in your portfolio.  You have pretty significant basis risk versus treasuries and the TDA market when doing that. And in April, we saw 11,000 contracts executed on those rate lock Future. So, there's a lot of green shoots there within data. And I think you'll see that feed multiple different line items in the future as those develop."

            "content": "Thank you, Ben. And good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 9. I'll begin by touching on our pending acquisition of Black Knight. Since the initial announcement in May of 2022, ICE has remained unwavering in its belief and commitment to the combination of our companies.  In March, we announced revised terms of our merger agreement to acquire Black Knight at $75 per share or a market value of $11.7 billion from our previous terms of $85 per share. Black Knight's shareholders approved this revised deal last week.  In addition, and although ICE strongly believes that acquiring Black Knight is entirely pro-competitive. We also announced an agreement to sell Black Knight's Empower loan origination system, plus certain related businesses to Constellation Software Inc. We did this in order to remove a perceived horizontal competition concern.  The divestiture transaction is subject to the closing of ICE's acquisition of Black Knight and other customary closing conditions. ICE and Black Knight intend to defend the pro-consumer merits of our revised merger in Federal District Court. A scheduling hearing is scheduled to take place on May 12th to establish the timetable for this process, after which time we'll have a better ability to discuss the calendar for deal completion.  We're unable to answer any questions on this call relating to our transaction with Black Knight. We remain fully confident in our position and we look forward to presenting it in court. Importantly, we're very excited about the value and the efficiencies that the combined entities will bring to the end-consumer, as well as other stakeholders across the mortgage ecosystem.  Shifting to our strong results, the first quarter was highlighted by record adjusted operating results that include continued compounding recurring revenue growth across all three business segments, along with record revenues and our Exchanged and Fixed Income and Data Services businesses.  Remarkably, we did this against last year's exceptional first quarter with its unprecedented volatility driven largely by the onset of conflict in the Ukraine. These strong first quarter results are a testament to the value of our data and technology and the strength of our strategic business model. Over the past 20 years, ICE has continually evolved to meet the needs of our customers, resulting in value for our stockholders. Our evolution has been intentional, diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues.  The compounding growth of our subscription-based services combined with our diverse transaction- based businesses means that our growth is not tied to one economic cycle to one geography or to one asset class. This provides upside exposure while hedging our downside risk.  Looking to the balance of the year and beyond, we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us and we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers, while driving compounding growth for our stockholders.  Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to say thank you to our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to say thank you to my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to another good quarter.  And with that, I'll turn the call now, back to our moderator Laura and will conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time. This is Jeff. So, we sort of have our point in two places with respect to digital assets. First of all, we created Back and then spun it out as its own public company. And while I can't speak for Back management, the philosophy that we put into the company at the time of the spin was to be highly regulated.  In other words, to get 50 state money transmitter licenses and set up a custodial banking practice under the New York Banking Regulations. And so, from the onset, I would say, we had the philosophy that anything we did around digital assets should be, should comport to existing regulation. The - we own and operate the world's largest exchange, The New York Stock Exchange, 350 billion transactions a day.  And we have the infrastructure to list digital assets. It is different than a lot of the entrepreneurs in the digital space in that a requirement of the US Securities Exchange is that its members have to be licensed broker/dealers. So there is no such thing as NYSE Direct. It's not that we couldn't build NYSE Direct. It's not that we don't have relationships with end-users.  But the law says that that end-users need to come through broker/dealers who provide KYC and AML oversight to the market. And so, so far that model hasn't been one that the market has been interested in. But our ability to list a digital asset is actually quite easy. It's obviously a token and registering on a public blockchain is actually relatively simple given the complexity of the infrastructure that we're used to operate in.  So, we'll see how this unfolds. It does appear that the SEC and other regulators would prefer to use that traditional infrastructure for tokens in the United States and a lot of their compliance activities seem to be focused on moving the existing market towards our model and the historical model. And to the extent that there's an appetite for us it would be easy for us to list digital assets. And we obviously have the domain knowledge here having built back on how to operate in a public blockchain environment. I'd also \u2013 this is Jeff. I'd also tell you that, one of the things we're seeing is much like it came out of the dotcom boom, where, there were thousands of tech companies and that then really reduced down to a core group of companies that emerged as the largest companies in the United States today. And the reason is similar to the environment were in today, is that in tougher periods like we're in right now, with mortgage, within a higher interest rate environment, clients are more apt to talk to us and listen to our pitch about changing their behavior that they're looking for cost efficiencies.  A couple of years ago, when the market was at its peak in terms of transaction volume and everybody's busy in making money, it's actually hard in an environment to convince people to change their behavior. But our team has been really seeing a lot more success now in this environment with people focused on the new model that we're bringing, as Ben mentioned, a subscription, SaaS-based model that that has deep connectivity across the mortgage ecosystem that will allow them to save money and ultimately pass those lower costs on to consumers. And so, it's actually a pretty good environment for us to try to advance a different model across the industry. That's a really good question actually. I don't want to focus on specifically our fixed income business, but let me speak broadly. And the answer is, yes. I feel like as a management team, we promise that we're going to deliver growth. And sometimes we can do that by building new technologies as we just talked about in mortgage.  Sometimes we do it by acquisition and sometimes, it's better to do dispositions and reallocate the capital. And, and I think, through the history of this management team, we've not been afraid to spin businesses out. We've obviously acquired a lot of businesses and we're good at integrating businesses. It's actually pretty strong domain capability of this company. But we also are good at organizing businesses and spinning them out.  Ben oversaw along with some Black Knight people, the ability to put together their loan origination platform and take it to market. So, we're not afraid to move businesses around if there's value there. The other thing I would say to you is that, if the market doesn't appreciate of the overall footprint of ICE, it's you as an investor and an investor advocate, think that some of the parts would be better organized differently. Then as a management team, we should be open to that. We like actually running smaller, flatter businesses that have entrepreneurial bents to them. And so the complexity of being a large organization actually can sometimes frustrate that.  And so maybe unlike many management teams, we like being small and nimble. So, a longwinded answer of saying, yeah, we look at everything. And we do meet routinely all the people on this call. We meet routinely to go through all of our business units. And what our competitors are doing, what the landscape is and think about whether there are opportunities to organize differently. Well, let me thank you, Lauren for being today's operator and thank you all for joining us this morning. I want to also send out a special thank you to Rich Repetto of Piper Sandler, as many of you know he dialed in very early this morning in order to open today's questioning, as he's done every quarter since our initial public offering in 2005. And we understand that Rich plans to move on to new opportunities this summer.  So I represent everyone in the room when I say that, we will miss hearing his thoughtful questions going forward. And Rich, I just want to say, thank you for your commitment to following our company and our progress. And in your absence, please know that we're going to continue to strive to innovate for our customers and build an all-weather business model that will continue to grow.  With that, have a great day, everyone. Thank you."

Ben Jackson is not able to join today's call as he's recovering from a successful knee surgery. Our Chief Operating Officer, Stuart Williams, is in the room with us today. Ben plans to be back in a few days' time. Let's start by turning our call over to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our record third quarter results. Third quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.3 billion, including record transaction revenues of $1.1 billion and record recurring revenues of $1.2 billion. Pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight, total revenue increased by 7% versus last year and is up 6% through the first 3 quarters of 2024. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $960 million, up 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. As a result of this strong performance, adjusted pro forma operating income increased by 12% versus the prior year, reaching a record $1.4 billion with adjusted earnings per share totaling a record $1.55. Moving to the balance sheet, we reduced debt outstanding by approximately $600 million during the quarter, ending the period with adjusted leverage of approximately 3.5x EBITDA. Before I move to our segment results, I will note a few guidance items. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect OTC and other revenue to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million as the third quarter benefited from several items we do not anticipate will repeat. In addition and similar to last year, in light of the strong performance in our cash equities business where revenues are up 15% year-to-date, we are providing customers with a regulatory fee holiday which we expect will reduce OTC and other revenues by $15 million to $20 million in the fourth quarter. Shifting to expenses, we expect fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $977 million to $987 million, including approximately $10 million to $15 million of items that we also do not expect will repeat. Lastly, full year CapEx is now expected to be in the range of $700 million to $740 million, largely driven by key data center investments originally planned for 2025. We expect these investments will yield expense efficiencies upon project completion in 2026. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.3 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of $890 million were up 17%, driven by a 34% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues which grew 23% year-over-year. This strong energy performance was on top of 42% growth in last year's third quarter and included a 16% increase in our oil complex, 24% growth in global natural gas revenues and 60% growth in our environmental business. In addition, towards the end of October, open interest is up 23% year-over-year, including 32% growth in global interest rates and 26% growth in our energy markets. Shifting to recurring revenues which include our Exchange data services and our NYC listings business, revenue totaled $364 million which included a few million dollars related to auto recoveries. Underpinning growth in our recurring revenues was our broader Exchange data services which was once again led by the continued expansion of our global energy and environmental network. In our listings business, while less than half of global IPOs have met the standards to list so far in 2024, the NYSE has helped to raise $14 billion in new proceeds, welcoming 43 new operating companies, representing 7 of the top 10 IPOs and 8 of the top 10 performing IPOs year-to-date. In addition, NYSE continued its leadership on transfers welcoming 10 operating companies year-to-date. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled a record $586 million, including transaction revenues of $125 million. On a year-over-year basis, growth in minis, corporates as well as CDS clearing activity was offset by lower treasury trading at ICE bonds and slightly lower member interest revenues. Record recurring revenues totaled $461 million and grew by 6% year-over-year. In our fixed income data and analytics business, revenues also increased by 6% year-over-year to a record $295 million, driven by growth in pricing and reference data and nearly 30% growth in our index business which benefited from both rising markets and fund flows into ETFs that track ICE indices. Importantly, ETF AUM tracking ICE indices ended the third quarter at a record $674 billion [ph]. Other data and network services revenues increased by 5% in the third quarter. Growth was driven by our ICE Global Network as recent data center investments have come online, growth in our consolidated feeds business and continued strength in our desktop solutions, driven in part by adoption of our energy desktop by both commercial customers and traders. These are just a few examples of investments we have made following our 2015 acquisition of IDC to continuously increase and enhance the content on our network as well as our underlying technology to drive growth. Please flip to Slide 7 where I'll discuss our Mortgage Technology results. Third quarter revenues totaled $509 million. Recurring revenues totaled $387 million. While recurring revenues declined year-over-year, as expected, they stabilized relative to the second quarter, driven by an improvement in data and analytics and offset by the semi-annual removal of retired loans on our servicing platform as well as lower minimums on Encompass. Similar to the last several quarters, while the majority of Encompass customers renewed at higher minimums, we also had customers renew at lower minimums. Importantly, lower minimums at renewal are also paired with a higher price per closed loan or transaction fee, a dynamic that will provide a more material tailwind to revenues as the origination market normalizes. Transaction revenues totaled $122 million, up slightly year-over-year and relative to the second quarter, driven by revenue related to Encompass closed loans and applications as well as an increase in MERS registrations. Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect total IMT revenues to be between $495 million and $505 million, with the delta relative to the third quarter largely driven by purchase market seasonality and related traction revenue. While mortgage origination volumes appear to have stabilized and seem likely to trend around these levels in the near term, we will continue to invest in developing new products, enhancing our technology and our existing product suite as well as expanding our network, all of which will further position our end-to-end platform to generate growth when market conditions normalize. In summary, we delivered record third quarter results, including record revenues, operating income and adjusted EPS, building upon our record first half results and representing the best year-to-date performance in our company's history. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and creating value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Stuart.\nStuart Williams: Thank you, Warren and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. For over 2 decades, we've worked closely with our customers to develop a network of diverse liquid and globally interconnected energy markets. This network provides the critical feedback loop required to solve near-term supply and demand imbalances and the long-term price signals needed to efficiently allocate capital investment to meet forward-looking demand. Today, our customers across the globe leverage our markets to help balance the demands of energy security, affordability and sustainability while allocating the capital necessary to meet rising energy demands critical to economic growth and managing the risks associated with a complex geopolitical environment. The breadth and depth of our global platform not only drove another record quarter across our energy complex but importantly, it positions us to capture secular tailwinds, including the globalization of natural gas and the clean energy transition, trends we began investing in over a decade ago. Through constant reinvention and innovation, Brent has firmly established itself as the global benchmark for crude oil, pricing roughly 3/4 of the world's internationally traded crude and from which prices are discovered in the U.S. Gulf Coast via ICE's Midland WTI Futures market and in the Middle East and Asia via ICE's Murban and Dubai futures markets. Reflecting this dynamic, volume in our global oil complex increased 17% year-over-year. This strong performance includes records across Brent, WTI, Midland WTI and Murban and contributed to record oil revenues which grew 16% in the quarter. These strong trends have continued into October with record total oil open interest up 28% and Brent options up 68 -- 86% year-over-year. These critical pricing relationships extend to refined oil products where ICE's low sulfur gas oil markets similarly anchors price discovery for refined products globally with markets such as ICE's Heating Oil Futures and ICE Singapore Gasoil reflecting regional dynamics in the U.S. and Asia, respectively. We continue to see strong growth across refined products with Gasoil open interest up 63% year-over-year, supporting double-digit growth across the refined products complex, including growth in cleaner fuels such as ICE's global marine fuel and biofuel markets. Today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmental markets, account for roughly 45% of our energy revenues, up from 1/3 a decade ago and have grown 21% on average over the past 5 years, including 34% growth year-to-date. This strong performance has been a key contributor to the 13% average growth rate in our energy platform over that time frame, including 29% growth year-to-date. The globalization of natural gas through liquefied natural gas or LNG has created virtual pipelines across oceans, removing the dependency on fixed pipeline infrastructure and storage. This, together with the ongoing liberalization of the natural gas market and buyers increasingly favoring short-term contracts and spot market procurement, has put the more natural gas in motion over longer distances with a greater number of touch points along the value chain from production to consumption, creating a truly global commodity. Furthermore, given its abundance, lower emissions and lower switching costs, we expect natural gas to continue to benefit from increasing energy demand, particularly in the developing world and the ongoing focus on decarbonization. Since the year 2000, energy consumption in non-OECD countries has more than doubled with much of this growth coming in the form of coal. Last year, global coal consumption hit an all-time high, primarily supported by Asia where coal still accounts for nearly 50% of the region's energy supply. According to statistics published by the Energy Institute, the coal switching opportunity in Asia alone represents more energy than the total energy consumption in North America across all primary energy sources. In addition, the power demands of accelerating innovation, including artificial intelligence, are expected to require significant new generation capacity boosting demand for natural gas. These factors have caused markets across Europe, Asia and North America to become increasingly interconnected, accelerating demand for deep, liquid and global risk management tools. This evolution has driven the development of new trading relationships, as illustrated by record participation in our natural gas portfolio in the third quarter. This has been accompanied by volume and revenue growth with each growing double digits on average over the past 5 years, including 34% and 32% growth year-to-date, respectively. In addition, open interest trends remained strong through October, up 27% year-over-year, including a 51% increase in our TTF complex, a 53% increase in our Asian JKM market and a 24% increase in our North American gas business. As the Brent of natural gas, our Title Transfer Facility benchmark, or TTF, continues to be relied upon by an increasing number of market participants with market participation growing 15% on average over the past 5 years. In the third quarter, volumes in our TTF complex increased 16% year-over-year, driving revenue growth of 19% versus 2023. In Asia, underpinned by surging economic growth and a focus towards cleaner forms of energy, our Japan and Korea market, or JKM, continues to reach important milestones, setting records across key liquidity indicators in the third quarter, including participation, volume and open interest. Importantly, the extent to which global gas markets are interconnected was once again reinforced by JKM execution patterns with over 60% of JKM volumes executed via the JKM TTF spread. In North America, market participants seeking to manage exposure to U.S. natural gas pricing dynamics continue to gravitate towards ICE's Henry Hub contracts for the liquidity ICE offers in longer-dated tenors, along with the linkage to our exclusive regional basis markets which spans 70 trading hubs across North America. In the third quarter, volume in our North American gas complex increased 39% year-over-year. Finally, with Canada expected to significantly ramp up its LNG export capacity from 2025, increased exports from the West Coast of North America to Asia should add a further dimension to the supply equation. ICE's Calgary-based Natural Gas Exchange, or ICE NGX, has operated in the Alberta natural gas and electricity futures market for 30 years, developing the AECO hub into one of North America's most liquid spot and forward energy markets. ICE offers liquid markets in TTF, JKM, Henry Hub and the North American basis markets such as AECO, offering a broad range of natural gas benchmarks with trading hubs across Europe, Asia and North America. As the global landscape of LNG exports, geopolitical forces and shift towards cleaner energy all continue to evolve, we see these dynamics continuing to favor our growing global gas complex well into the future. As policy discussions on how best to deliver global sustainability objectives continue to evolve, our liquid and transparent environmental markets, first launched almost 2 decades ago, continue to see growth, providing transparent, market-based pricing for both positive and negative externalities. Here, we have seen the number of active market participants grow double digits on average over the past 5 years, including record participation in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year. At the same time, our North American environmental complex reached record volumes in the quarter, increasing 70% versus prior year. While volumes in our European emission allowance futures and options increased 45%, this strong performance has contributed to the 49% growth in our environmental revenues year-to-date, including 60% growth in the third quarter. In summary, as the confluence of increasing energy demand, evolving supply chains and the energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility into energy markets, our global environmental markets, alongside our global gas, oil, coal and power markets, provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools that will enable participants to navigate this multilayered and nonlinear transition. Before I hand over to Jeff, I wanted to briefly touch on our interest rate markets which hit record volume during the quarter, increasing 50% year-over-year. A mixed inflation picture, low unemployment, weaker economic data and ongoing geopolitical uncertainty continue to drive demand for interest rate risk management. ICE's liquid, multicurrency, short-term interest rate complex includes the key benchmark Euribor, SONIA and SARON markets used to manage short-term interest rate risk in euros, pound sterling and Swiss francs, respectively. As the benchmark for managing short-term euro interest rate risk, ICE's Euribor volume increased 47% year-over-year in the third quarter with open interest up 15% in October. The latest addition to ICE's multicurrency STIR complex, the euro short-term rate, or ESTER, continues to break records across all liquidity metrics, including open interest hitting a record 681,000 contracts during October. ICE's SONIA market, the benchmark for managing U.K. interest rate risk, traded a record 14 million contracts in September, contributing to a 53% growth year-to-date. Trends towards the end of October remained robust with open interest up 71%. ICE also hosts the Gilt futures market, the benchmark for the U.K. government bond yield curve, where volume is up 30% year-to-date, including 42% growth in the third quarter with open interest up 92% year-over-year. The disparity between the expected relative parts for the central banks has been a consistent theme over the last year. This has been beneficial for our rates franchise, both in terms of volume and open interest and looks set to continue as our customers rely on the deep liquidity and capital efficiencies at ICE. With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Thank you, Stuart. Please now turn to Slide 9. Operating marketplaces with strong network effects is a core expertise at ICE. Today, we do so across an array of asset classes, geographies and customer types. In the U.S. home mortgage market, we're following the proven playbook that we've applied across other asset classes. We're leveraging leading technology, mission-critical data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that improve workflow efficiencies and connect market participants to one another. With a touch point to nearly every market participant in the U.S. mortgage space, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital network provides for. September marked our 1-year anniversary since we closed on the acquisition of Black Knight. So I thought it would be appropriate to give you an update on how this company and its technologies have been integrated into our network. By adding Black Knight's servicing technology with its over 100 servicing clients and robust data and analytics to our network, ICE assembled a true life-of-loan offering that spans from the point of consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary capital markets. We organized once-disparate assets into a unified network that communicates seamlessly from end to end. The construction of a mortgage can begin with our industry-leading customer engagement suite. We brought together Ellie Mae's Velocify and Consumer Connect platforms and married them to Black Knight's marketing automation solution called Surefire, tying together the pieces required for a complete customer engagement suite. Surefire leverages data to create effective marketing campaigns, nurtures them to the mortgage application and educates and informs borrowers throughout the funding process. Additionally, this platform provides direct channel outreach after the loan closing to help capture repeat business. Velocify is a sales automation solution that enables loan officers to capture missed opportunities and communicate with borrowers to close loans faster. And Consumer Connect provides a state-of-the-art digital mortgage experience to the consumer for the home buying process. We've unified these systems which now seamlessly operate as one to feed the Encompass loan underwriting platform. With Encompass, we successfully added a browser-based front end for loan underwriting and integrated new automation tools. And we added more ways to partner and extend the platform by increasing network APIs. Lenders can take advantage of products that are integrated via our partner network, while partners are able to build and release distributed products just one time. And once released, lenders can use a partner product across all of ICE Mortgage Technology's lender-facing applications. In addition, we connected data assets from Black Knight, including property tax, flood and closing fee information into Encompass. We also moved AllRegs, our market-leading tool for compliance-related information, into the ICE cloud and we deeply integrated it into Encompass. We enhanced this offering by incorporating a generative AI model so that natural language inquiries generate loan program information and guideline summaries from the most comprehensive compliance library available in the industry, covering nearly 1 million pages. We previously mentioned that we took a product formerly called AIQ, extended its capabilities to further automate data extraction and integrated it into Encompass. This product, now known as ICE Data & Document Automation, or DDA, captures the information provided by a borrower. Whether a document was shared via a portal, e-mail, fax or scan, DDA normalizes it, standardizes its naming and puts everything in the correct order. This creates consistency, uniformity and efficiency. A team of about 200 of our technologists have further expanded the capabilities of DDA by building sophisticated income and credit analyzers to deploy one of the most important new technologies to be offered in the U.S. mortgage space. These sophisticated analyzers transform formerly manual operations into automated, exception-based workflows. Key steps in the underwriting process are accelerated, including investigation to determine the creditworthiness of a wide range of borrowers for GSE guaranteed loan eligibility or for HUD's affordable loan program for a given metropolitan statistical area. This comes at a time when prospective homebuyers are facing the most daunting affordability challenges in 4 decades and at a time when many borrowers have nontraditional income streams that don't neatly fit on a Form W-2. These new analyzers drive greater operational efficiency to help lower mortgage origination costs for lenders and, ultimately, borrowers. We continue to invest in our product and pricing engine by providing additional options to lenders, servicers and their funding partners. We've connected our network directly to Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae for seamless pricing inquiries. As a result, we went live with 32 new price engine clients this year, accompanied by a strong pipeline of 19 others that are currently in the implementation phase. We also deployed our team to bring Black Knight's loan servicing onto our network, recently announcing the integration of Encompass underwriting system with the MSP servicing system, with documents now moving straight from origination through to servicing. Taking it a step further, we also incorporated DDA into MSP so that servicers can quickly identify any critical information that may be missing from a loan file as the documents progress. And we cemented this integration milestone with the signing of JPMorgan Chase to also utilize this platform for their servicing business. We continue to enhance the MSP loan servicing technology since our acquisition of Black Knight by investing in a new user interface called MSP DX. This interface modernizes access and control of the legacy loan servicing platform and streamlines key tasks across loan onboarding, investor reporting and customer service. It allows users to seamlessly retrieve data and evoke servicing actions through a conversational user interface. And its expanded capability facilitates loan triage, providing users with an efficient view of relevant information when working on loan exceptions. We've also further automated the credit dispute processes to help mortgage servicers meet their 30-day reporting obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Our expertise at digitization has led to continued innovation for the secondary market for home mortgages. In the third quarter, we went live with our MBS mortality indicator which leverages data sets across ICE Mortgage Technology and ICE Data Services to produce daily trading signals for agency residential MBS pools. We believe these signals are significantly more accurate at predicting near-term prepayments than the legacy products in the market. In summary, we've assembled and expanded a leading customer engagement suite, underwriting tools, pricing systems, closing tools, registration tools, servicing systems and the resulting data and integrated them into ICE's network for the U.S. mortgage industry. ICE brings together the key industry stakeholders from origination to final settlement in a single network ecosystem. That's roughly 85% of all U.S. home mortgages connected to more than 3,000 lenders, 48,000 settlement agents and closing attorneys, 2,500 county governments, the GSEs, 80,000 notaries, 100 loan servicing companies, 1,000 mortgage-backed security investment firms and thousands of third-party data and service providers who can now communicate with one another via a common data standard on a robust network operated under ICE's cyber overlay. We believe that we've created a platform where every new participant who joins this network makes the platform increasingly more valuable to its other users. Essentially, we've moved ICE from selling software to offering a growing network for the management of the home mortgage life cycle. Throughout this journey and consistent with our approach across other asset classes, we remain focused on executing on our strategy of relieving pain points across the mortgage workflow while investing ahead of secular growth to enhance the value proposition of our network. Turning now to Slide 10. Since our founding, ICE has operated with a strategy to build tools and markets for institutions and consumers which operate in the white space of the inefficiencies of legacy markets. We seek to do so in a manner that enables us to grow our earnings in all economic conditions so that ICE is truly an all-weather growth story. Our record third quarter following up on our unsurpassed first half results are a testament to the execution of this strategy, the business model that we've intentionally built and the value of our strategic capital allocation. It's how we've grown our adjusted earnings per share every year that we've been a public company. And finally, I'd like to retell you that a decade ago, ICE sought to expand in the global financial markets by merging LIFFE, the London International Financial Futures Exchange, with our London-based commodity exchange and clearinghouse in order to create a global risk management powerhouse. With great respect, I'd like to end my prepared remarks by acknowledging the contributions of Sir Brian Williamson and Hugh Freedberg who built, saved and nurtured that LIFFE exchange. This world recently lost both gentlemen. And I hope that as they look down upon us, they regard my colleagues and I as worthy stewards of their vision. And I hope they smile along with us at our record interest rate derivative activity in the third quarter, up 50% year-over-year. Let me now turn the call back to our moderator, Lydia and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Alex Kramm with UBS.\nAlex Kramm: I'm just going to start with an unanswerable question, I think, as I think about the energy business. As we think about the end of the year and into 2025, obviously, a lot of detail here in terms of the structural opportunities. And clearly, that's reflected in the open interest growth that we've seen and, obviously, volumes this year, too. But look, clearly, it's been a solid environment as well from a trading perspective, in particular, in the fourth quarter with some of the volatility we've seen from the Middle East. So clearly, there's been some beta help here as well. So I'm just wondering, I know it's very difficult, if you can separate the alpha and the beta a little bit and how you think about that heading into 2025, what's repeatable and where are you a little bit worried that the trading environment may not be as good? I know it's a lengthy question.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Alex, this is Jeff. And since that's an unanswerable question, let's put the new guy on it and ask Stuart if he can handle it.\nStuart Williams: Thanks, Jeff and thanks, Alex, for the question. It is a great question. Perhaps the way to think about this and I think you picked up on a really important point there, Alex, when you referenced open interest. So as unanswerable as it might be, open interest is always a good indicator of future volume because this is -- these are positions being placed by real market participants. And those positions will need to be managed in the future as markets evolve. But the other way we think about this is that there is a linkage between the geopolitical events which you referenced in your question which do create short-term volatility but which also creates often new supply chains which then will leverage other parts of that matrix product setup that we've got which spans energy types and geography and the environmental markets. So just giving you an example of that, one of the things we saw after Europe's efforts to remove Russian hydrocarbons from its supply chain, we saw new supply routes coming from the Middle East up into Europe which we've never foreseen when we first set up ICE Futures Abu Dhabi but that's what happened. And so what we find is a lot of these geopolitical events create different supply chain opportunities which continue to drive growth in different parts of our energy markets. The focus that we've had over the last 20 years, though, has been to create that network of markets that provides a pricing point at each geography, energy type and environmental touch point so that whatever happens, whether it's geopolitical, whether it's supply chain changes, however the market evolves, we have the opportunity to provide that tool to our customers and can benefit off the back of that. The other point I would make, just in closing the answer, is we're very clearly at an inflection point where the growth we've seen over the last 20 years in absolute energy consumption is set to continue. About 80% of the world's population lives in non-OECD countries which, on average, on a per capita basis, only uses 1/3 of the energy of the equivalent people living in OECD countries. Put differently, energy consumption could well double over the next 25 years according to many economists. And a lot of that is going to be in places in the developing world where contracts like JKM and TTF and Brent and Dubai and Murban are critical in managing price risks around those areas. So we feel pretty good about the opportunity ahead of us. But as you say, it's pretty difficult to quantify that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America.\nCraig Siegenthaler: We had a question on the new partnership between ICE Bonds and MarketAxess. So how will this partnership enhance your liquidity pool and client value proposition? And will we see it translate into stronger market share trends? If I could just squeeze one more in. Could this lead down the road to a closer relationship with MarketAxess ranging from a full acquisition or a strategic minority equity investment?\nChristopher Edmonds: Craig, it's Chris Edmonds. Thanks for the question. I probably will avoid the second one you asked. But look, the partnership with MarketAxess, it really gives us an opportunity where we have a very unique client base that is different than the MarketAxess traditional client base. But there are different pools of liquidity because of what they represent. And so this gives the -- this combination gives us the ability for all of our clients to make sure they have access to the liquidity they're looking for. It's still early days but it has gone very well for both of us. We're both happy with it. I spoke with them yesterday. Things continue to progress in a positive way there. And we will look to add other instruments along the way as the market continues to evolve into the future. But like I said, I'll probably avoid the last question you asked there. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Budish with Barclays.\nBenjamin Budish: I just wanted to dig in a little deeper to the fourth quarter IMT guidance. It looks like -- at least I know you tend to be a little bit more conservative than the MBA forecast but they show sort of an expected pickup between refis and purchases together. So just curious if you could kind of comment on that. And then, maybe could you perhaps remind us how should we be thinking about your overall sensitivity to pickup in transactions given there's a minimum component? Like how would you describe the current level of activity? Are most of your customers below that minimum level such that incremental transactions don't add as much? Like how should we sort of be thinking about that in Q4 and into next year?\nWarren Gardiner: Yes, Ben, it's a good question and thank you for it. So in terms of the first part of that question, so the fourth quarter guidance, as I said, it does assume some -- a slower purchase market. And when we see that in every fourth quarter, generally speaking, that trends off and that generally happens in the first quarter as well for what it's worth. It just the weather, frankly, at the end of the day and to people looking at houses and buying houses. So that's a typical pattern that we see. I think in terms of how that compares to what the MBA may be expecting, I don't know that that has really captured the sharper move higher in interest rates and mortgage rates over the last few weeks. So there may be a little bit more of an aggressive assumption on what refinancing may be looking like in that particular period. And so, we base -- what we're looking at is really what we're seeing on the application front and what we're seeing on the closed loan front in terms of what we can see in the next quarter or so. So I think it's a pretty good guide in terms of what one would expect for the quarter given where we're a month through here and it generally takes sort of 30, 60 days to close a loan. So those application volumes can be pretty indicative of what this quarter will look like. On your second question, yes, look, we still have a significant portion of the customers that are under their minimums today. But each quarter, that's getting better. And in fact, the third quarter was the best in 2 years or so, over 2 years and that's been steadily improving throughout this year. So not only does an improving loan market help that but so does the fact that we have actually been renewing some of these customers towards lower minimums as well. And so the bar, if you will, is a little bit lower. And so we've seen that transaction getting better the last few quarters, albeit still small and customers are crossing over their minimums with that being a big reason why it's improving. But we are -- that is a big reason why we are actually outperforming in terms of our transaction revenue relative to the market is some of those customers crossing over that minimum, not paying transaction fees in the prior period and now paying transaction fees. And I think as that market normalizes, you're going to see that continue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies.\nDan Fannon: So Warren, another question for you, just on expenses. So curious about the step-up into 4Q, kind of what's driving that? And then I know it's early but thinking about the building blocks for '25, if you can kind of give us the framework to think about maybe versus previous years. And also in the context of the mortgage business, if we do see a pickup in activity, the incremental margin of that business as we think about volumes starting to pick up more materially with rates changing as we go into next year.\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks, Dan. Good question. So as I noted, in terms of the fourth quarter, there's about $10 million to $15 million of onetime expenses that you'll want to take out of that in terms of thinking about a core run rate. Those one-times were several items really across different areas of the business unrelated that kind of hit all towards -- that we incurred, if you will, or realized we were going to incur towards the end of this quarter. So I think if you take that, you're probably down to $970 million or so versus the $960 million we had this quarter. And the difference there is going to be on the SG&A side to a degree. We did have a little bit lower marketing and customer acquisition costs in the third quarter that should pick up a bit in the fourth quarter, a little bit higher professional services fees as well that will come in next quarter -- or in the fourth quarter, I should say. So I think as you're thinking about next year, the $970 million, that's probably a good jumping off point and to annualize that, of course and then think about a similar framework that we've used in the past. We're going to invest in our people, we'll invest in the business, the technology and continue to do that as you've seen us do in the last number of years. So I think it's -- that will be a fair way to be thinking about it as we move into next year. We'll, of course, give you more granular guidance when we get there. On your second question on the incremental margins, you're 100% right. As the transaction backdrop improves and the market backdrop improves for loan originations, those are -- it's somewhat similar, if not entirely similar to what you would expect and see in our futures business or the New York Stock Exchange, where the transaction revenues have pretty high incremental margins on them. So that will certainly be a benefit to the segment margin and to the overall margin as that loan market normalizes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Citi.\nChris Allen: I wanted to circle back a little bit on energy. Kind of curious where you see pockets of opportunity from a customer perspective, whether it's customers overseas trading U.S. benchmarks or natural gas moving into the crude markets. And then I also wanted to ask about the sustainable aviation fuel market. There's been reports about energy majors investing in Brazil. And just given ICE's position in sugar and energy, it seems like a great opportunity. So wondering how you think about that from a market development opportunity set.\nStuart Williams: Chris, this is Stuart here. Thank you for the question. Starting with your question on the customer base, we're seeing, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're seeing a significant increase and continued growth in our customer base. The participation in our markets, that's really 2 factors. We're seeing net new participants coming into our marketplace, particularly out in Asia as hedging strategies continue to mature out there. But we're also seeing participants pivot from markets they've been active in historically into new markets. So for example, people that have historically been trading a lot of Henry Hub on our very regular in our TTF market and getting involved there. In terms of how that mix evolves, more and more customers are having global exposures. One of the side effects of the globalization of gas is that gas players globally and particularly in the U.S., now that the U.S. is a major export of LNG, need to be cognizant of and have risks to manage in respect of prices, not just in the U.S. but globally. So we've got a lot of global producers in the U.S. that are now looking at both TTF numbers as well as Henry Hub numbers and indeed some of our basis numbers to figure out whether it's best to pipe that gas internally to whether it's for data center usage or other power usage in the U.S. or to export that in the form of LNG to whether it's Europe or Asia. So we're seeing a lot of our U.S. participants now actively trading and holding positions in markets like TTF and JKM. I think the other trend, just pivoting quickly to oil which has been very interesting, you'll recall that a few years ago, we set up a new market in the U.S. Gulf Coast to better reflect the export price of Permian WTI coming out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. And again, as the U.S. continues to export more and more Permian-grade WTI and as that grade is now linked into Brent, we're seeing a lot more physical participants in the U.S. Permian producers using our numbers to price their exports out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. You might have seen just this last week, the shale producer, Continental Resources, announced that it was switching its Permian pricing to ICE's HOU contract which is replacing a differential to WTI Cushing. So that's all pointing in a good direction at the increased participation. Just pivoting then to your second question around sustainable aviation fuel or SAF, it is definitely a market we're looking at. What I referenced in my prepared remarks around our biofuels markets which ICE is very active in, we're seeing strong growth there. So that will be the area that SAF plays into. And as you, again, you alluded to, we're seeing increasing correlation between the sugar markets and the energy markets as a decent chunk of that sugar supply ends up in energy. So you're quite right, this is an opportunity. It's early days in the SAF market. The market structure is still evolving in that space but we continue to monitor that as time goes on.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs.\nAlex Blostein: Jeff, a little bit of a maybe bigger-picture mortgage question for you guys. Obviously, you talked a lot about the progress you're making in sort of integrating various parts of the mortgage network. It's always been an important part of the thesis for you guys, lots of work behind the team -- scenes, sorry, despite the fact that the environment obviously hasn't been particularly helpful here. So when do you expect all these efforts to show up in better revenue growth? So in other words, do we need to see a much better, broader industry volumes to sort of kind of like beta help? Or do you think some of these things could actually show up in better revenue trajectory into 2025 regardless of what industry volumes look like?\nJeffrey Sprecher: That's a good question. I tried to make a point in my prepared remarks that we really have moved to operating a network. And I made the point that every new market participant that joins the network makes the network more valuable to all the existing participants. And so that phenomenon is not really volume related. It's really helping others take costs out. And our expectation is that as we help reduce the cost of underwriting and placing a mortgage into the capital markets, that we'll participate in some of that benefit. Separately, Warren talks a lot about normalizing transaction volumes. And when we look at that, you can simply look over a decade before the COVID crisis or even back to year 2022 and you can see volumes that had they run through our platform would have contributed substantially to both the top and bottom line. So we do feel like there will be a mean reversion that will get to transactions. It's obviously hard to predict. But in the meantime, we're going to just keep driving that efficiency through the network.\nOperator: The next question comes from Simon Clinch with Redburn Atlantic.\nSimon Clinch: I wanted to actually ask a longer-term question just about the environmental markets, please. Perhaps you could -- could you frame the growth that we're seeing in terms of what the stages we're in, in terms of the emissions coverage of the schemes such as the European ETS? And then ultimately, how to think about the cadence of that growth as we move through the next 5 years? And then very long -- in the very long term, what -- how do we think about that market opportunity or that market existing in the point that we eventually get to net zero?\nStuart Williams: Thanks, Simon. Good question. The -- I think the way we're thinking about this from a macro perspective and I'll drill down into your specific question on the European ETS, carbon pricing, well, our view as market operators is that carbon pricing is going to be the most effective way to help channel investments that are needed in order to drive the complete reduction of carbon. And we've seen this very effectively play out in the U.K. as the U.K. drove coal out of its merit order using carbon pricing, the European Union on a similar kind of trajectory. So what we're seeing over the last couple of years is the dialogue around the importance of pricing carbon and more broadly environmental externalities is evolving. More governments, more policymakers are engaging with the subject and seeing the benefits of cap-and-trade systems which have been so successful in Europe and the U.K. and also in certain areas of the U.S. And so we are seeing more discussions around more coverage of carbon markets. And then within existing carbon markets, touching on your question on the European ETS, we're seeing the broadening of the coverage of those carbon markets. So only about 40% of the European emissions was covered under the EU ETS. That is now being extended to 80% as the ETS extends to other parts of the industry like shipping and that sort of thing. So the underlying market, if you like, is expanding which is also driving additional volume there. And then, of course, the other nascent market in the space, if you think of the compliance markets as the one end of the spectrum, on the other end, the so-called voluntary carbon markets or the carbon credit markets is another area where we continue to see discussions. Market structure there, again, is still very nascent. But what we've been working on in the meantime is putting in place a number of the building blocks that will be required for that market to scale, if it is ever going to scale, things like reference data. So we've got a product called ICE CRED which normalizes and standardizes all of the reference data that's available across the carbon credit landscape. That reference data is now available in ICE Chat where we're seeing a lot of the transaction activity, really OTC bilateral trading activity of carbon credits, referencing that reference data. And we've also got a futures -- a number of futures contracts, including the CORSIA futures contract which we launched recently which is really the credit market used by the aviation industry. So again, that's the second part of the market which is much less mature but we are seeing increasing interest as participants start to engage with our reference data and with ICE Chat transactions on that front.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington with JPMorgan.\nKen Worthington: Stuart, more for you, trial by fire. If we think about the globalization of gas driving your TTF and JKM contracts, we're seeing the growth of TTF far exceed the LNG capacity that has come online in recent years. There's some sort of multiplier or maybe it's speculators following hedgers. So how do you think about this relationship between molecules in motion, the need to hedge and what ends up ultimately is, I guess, I'll call it, normalized volume? And if LNG capacity is going to double over the next 3 years, what is reasonable to expect for this LNG relationship with TTF and JKM which you called out as sort of a nonlinear relationship?\nStuart Williams: Yes. Thanks for the question, Ken. I think the other dynamic to keep in mind when you're thinking about the volume on a futures contract versus the underlying market is the length of the curve. So we've got liquid pricing in TTF now going out 10 years. And so that's 10 years' worth of supply is the thing you need to be thinking about as you think about the hedging volumes on the exchange. But look, it's -- the thing that we -- the dynamic we're seeing is, as you said in your question, the demand for LNG is growing significantly and we see that as being a significant part of both the Asian growth story but also the Asian move to cleaner energies. So there's no question in our mind that LNG supply is going to need to increase significantly. The other dynamic here is because there is more liquid pricing in the marketplace, looking at the likes of TTF and JKM, more and more buyers and sellers are referencing TTF and JKM in the physical contracts. And so what that means is you're seeing less fixed price and more indexed transactions in the physical market which provides the optionality not just of taking LNG from point of production to point of demand but also you can, as you see in the oil market, have ships on route changing direction because odds have opened up. So what we're seeing in the gas market as part of this globalization story is a real modernization of the market structure where physical molecules are going to the best price. And as those prices evolve with greater transparency, those physical movements move with them. So net-net, what that means is there are more participants needing to hedge more molecules along more supply chain routes and we see that overall growing. And then again, to my earlier comments, liquidity down the curve is getting really strong. So we're seeing longer-dated hedging coming into the TTF contract as well.\nOperator: We're out of time for further questions. So I'll now hand you back to Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO, for any closing comments.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Well, thank you, Lydia and thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to innovate for our customers and continue our momentum to drive growth with an all-weather business model. And I hope that today, you avoid the witches and zombies and have a safe Halloween.\nOperator: This concludes our call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks, Jeff. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our record third quarter results. Third quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.3 billion, including record transaction revenues of $1.1 billion and record recurring revenues of $1.2 billion. Pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight, total revenue increased by 7% versus last year and is up 6% through the first 3 quarters of 2024. Third quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $960 million, up 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. As a result of this strong performance, adjusted pro forma operating income increased by 12% versus the prior year, reaching a record $1.4 billion with adjusted earnings per share totaling a record $1.55. Moving to the balance sheet, we reduced debt outstanding by approximately $600 million during the quarter, ending the period with adjusted leverage of approximately 3.5x EBITDA. Before I move to our segment results, I will note a few guidance items. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect OTC and other revenue to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million as the third quarter benefited from several items we do not anticipate will repeat. In addition and similar to last year, in light of the strong performance in our cash equities business where revenues are up 15% year-to-date, we are providing customers with a regulatory fee holiday which we expect will reduce OTC and other revenues by $15 million to $20 million in the fourth quarter. Shifting to expenses, we expect fourth quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $977 million to $987 million, including approximately $10 million to $15 million of items that we also do not expect will repeat. Lastly, full year CapEx is now expected to be in the range of $700 million to $740 million, largely driven by key data center investments originally planned for 2025. We expect these investments will yield expense efficiencies upon project completion in 2026. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Third quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.3 billion, up 12% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of $890 million were up 17%, driven by a 34% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues which grew 23% year-over-year. This strong energy performance was on top of 42% growth in last year's third quarter and included a 16% increase in our oil complex, 24% growth in global natural gas revenues and 60% growth in our environmental business. In addition, towards the end of October, open interest is up 23% year-over-year, including 32% growth in global interest rates and 26% growth in our energy markets. Shifting to recurring revenues which include our Exchange data services and our NYC listings business, revenue totaled $364 million which included a few million dollars related to auto recoveries. Underpinning growth in our recurring revenues was our broader Exchange data services which was once again led by the continued expansion of our global energy and environmental network. In our listings business, while less than half of global IPOs have met the standards to list so far in 2024, the NYSE has helped to raise $14 billion in new proceeds, welcoming 43 new operating companies, representing 7 of the top 10 IPOs and 8 of the top 10 performing IPOs year-to-date. In addition, NYSE continued its leadership on transfers welcoming 10 operating companies year-to-date. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our Fixed Income and Data Services segment. Third quarter revenues totaled a record $586 million, including transaction revenues of $125 million. On a year-over-year basis, growth in minis, corporates as well as CDS clearing activity was offset by lower treasury trading at ICE bonds and slightly lower member interest revenues. Record recurring revenues totaled $461 million and grew by 6% year-over-year. In our fixed income data and analytics business, revenues also increased by 6% year-over-year to a record $295 million, driven by growth in pricing and reference data and nearly 30% growth in our index business which benefited from both rising markets and fund flows into ETFs that track ICE indices. Importantly, ETF AUM tracking ICE indices ended the third quarter at a record $674 billion [ph]. Other data and network services revenues increased by 5% in the third quarter. Growth was driven by our ICE Global Network as recent data center investments have come online, growth in our consolidated feeds business and continued strength in our desktop solutions, driven in part by adoption of our energy desktop by both commercial customers and traders. These are just a few examples of investments we have made following our 2015 acquisition of IDC to continuously increase and enhance the content on our network as well as our underlying technology to drive growth. Please flip to Slide 7 where I'll discuss our Mortgage Technology results. Third quarter revenues totaled $509 million. Recurring revenues totaled $387 million. While recurring revenues declined year-over-year, as expected, they stabilized relative to the second quarter, driven by an improvement in data and analytics and offset by the semi-annual removal of retired loans on our servicing platform as well as lower minimums on Encompass. Similar to the last several quarters, while the majority of Encompass customers renewed at higher minimums, we also had customers renew at lower minimums. Importantly, lower minimums at renewal are also paired with a higher price per closed loan or transaction fee, a dynamic that will provide a more material tailwind to revenues as the origination market normalizes. Transaction revenues totaled $122 million, up slightly year-over-year and relative to the second quarter, driven by revenue related to Encompass closed loans and applications as well as an increase in MERS registrations. Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect total IMT revenues to be between $495 million and $505 million, with the delta relative to the third quarter largely driven by purchase market seasonality and related traction revenue. While mortgage origination volumes appear to have stabilized and seem likely to trend around these levels in the near term, we will continue to invest in developing new products, enhancing our technology and our existing product suite as well as expanding our network, all of which will further position our end-to-end platform to generate growth when market conditions normalize. In summary, we delivered record third quarter results, including record revenues, operating income and adjusted EPS, building upon our record first half results and representing the best year-to-date performance in our company's history. As we look to the balance of the year, we remain focused on meeting the needs of our customers, continuing to drive growth and creating value for our shareholders. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Stuart. Yes, Ben, it's a good question and thank you for it. So in terms of the first part of that question, so the fourth quarter guidance, as I said, it does assume some -- a slower purchase market. And when we see that in every fourth quarter, generally speaking, that trends off and that generally happens in the first quarter as well for what it's worth.

So there may be a little bit more of an aggressive assumption on what refinancing may be looking like in that particular period. And so, we base -- what we're looking at is really what we're seeing on the application front and what we're seeing on the closed loan front in terms of what we can see in the next quarter or so. So I think it's a pretty good guide in terms of what one would expect for the quarter given where we're a month through here and it generally takes sort of 30, 60 days to close a loan. So those application volumes can be pretty indicative of what this quarter will look like. On your second question, yes, look, we still have a significant portion of the customers that are under their minimums today. But each quarter, that's getting better.

We did have a little bit lower marketing and customer acquisition costs in the third quarter that should pick up a bit in the fourth quarter, a little bit higher professional services fees as well that will come in next quarter -- or in the fourth quarter, I should say. So I think as you're thinking about next year, the $970 million, that's probably a good jumping off point and to annualize that, of course and then think about a similar framework that we've used in the past. We're going to invest in our people, we'll invest in the business, the technology and continue to do that as you've seen us do in the last number of years. So I think it's -- that will be a fair way to be thinking about it as we move into next year. We'll, of course, give you more granular guidance when we get there. On your second question on the incremental margins, you're 100% right. As the transaction backdrop improves and the market backdrop improves for loan originations, those are -- it's somewhat similar, if not entirely similar to what you would expect and see in our futures business or the New York Stock Exchange, where the transaction revenues have pretty high incremental margins on them. So that will certainly be a benefit to the segment margin and to the overall margin as that loan market normalizes."

But look, the partnership with MarketAxess, it really gives us an opportunity where we have a very unique client base that is different than the MarketAxess traditional client base. But there are different pools of liquidity because of what they represent. And so this gives the -- this combination gives us the ability for all of our clients to make sure they have access to the liquidity they're looking for. It's still early days but it has gone very well for both of us. We're both happy with it. I spoke with them yesterday. Things continue to progress in a positive way there. And we will look to add other instruments along the way as the market continues to evolve into the future. But like I said, I'll probably avoid the last question you asked there. Thanks."

            "content": "Thank you, Katia. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Ben Jackson is not able to join today's call as he's recovering from a successful knee surgery. Our Chief Operating Officer, Stuart Williams, is in the room with us today. Ben plans to be back in a few days' time. Let's start by turning our call over to Warren. Thank you, Stuart. Please now turn to Slide 9. Operating marketplaces with strong network effects is a core expertise at ICE. Today, we do so across an array of asset classes, geographies and customer types. In the U.S. home mortgage market, we're following the proven playbook that we've applied across other asset classes. We're leveraging leading technology, mission-critical data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that improve workflow efficiencies and connect market participants to one another. With a touch point to nearly every market participant in the U.S. mortgage space, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital network provides for. September marked our 1-year anniversary since we closed on the acquisition of Black Knight. So I thought it would be appropriate to give you an update on how this company and its technologies have been integrated into our network. By adding Black Knight's servicing technology with its over 100 servicing clients and robust data and analytics to our network, ICE assembled a true life-of-loan offering that spans from the point of consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary capital markets. We organized once-disparate assets into a unified network that communicates seamlessly from end to end. The construction of a mortgage can begin with our industry-leading customer engagement suite. We brought together Ellie Mae's Velocify and Consumer Connect platforms and married them to Black Knight's marketing automation solution called Surefire, tying together the pieces required for a complete customer engagement suite. Surefire leverages data to create effective marketing campaigns, nurtures them to the mortgage application and educates and informs borrowers throughout the funding process. Additionally, this platform provides direct channel outreach after the loan closing to help capture repeat business. Velocify is a sales automation solution that enables loan officers to capture missed opportunities and communicate with borrowers to close loans faster. And Consumer Connect provides a state-of-the-art digital mortgage experience to the consumer for the home buying process. We've unified these systems which now seamlessly operate as one to feed the Encompass loan underwriting platform. With Encompass, we successfully added a browser-based front end for loan underwriting and integrated new automation tools. And we added more ways to partner and extend the platform by increasing network APIs. Lenders can take advantage of products that are integrated via our partner network, while partners are able to build and release distributed products just one time. And once released, lenders can use a partner product across all of ICE Mortgage Technology's lender-facing applications. In addition, we connected data assets from Black Knight, including property tax, flood and closing fee information into Encompass. We also moved AllRegs, our market-leading tool for compliance-related information, into the ICE cloud and we deeply integrated it into Encompass. We enhanced this offering by incorporating a generative AI model so that natural language inquiries generate loan program information and guideline summaries from the most comprehensive compliance library available in the industry, covering nearly 1 million pages. We previously mentioned that we took a product formerly called AIQ, extended its capabilities to further automate data extraction and integrated it into Encompass. This product, now known as ICE Data & Document Automation, or DDA, captures the information provided by a borrower. Whether a document was shared via a portal, e-mail, fax or scan, DDA normalizes it, standardizes its naming and puts everything in the correct order. This creates consistency, uniformity and efficiency. A team of about 200 of our technologists have further expanded the capabilities of DDA by building sophisticated income and credit analyzers to deploy one of the most important new technologies to be offered in the U.S. mortgage space. These sophisticated analyzers transform formerly manual operations into automated, exception-based workflows. Key steps in the underwriting process are accelerated, including investigation to determine the creditworthiness of a wide range of borrowers for GSE guaranteed loan eligibility or for HUD's affordable loan program for a given metropolitan statistical area. This comes at a time when prospective homebuyers are facing the most daunting affordability challenges in 4 decades and at a time when many borrowers have nontraditional income streams that don't neatly fit on a Form W-2. These new analyzers drive greater operational efficiency to help lower mortgage origination costs for lenders and, ultimately, borrowers. We continue to invest in our product and pricing engine by providing additional options to lenders, servicers and their funding partners. We've connected our network directly to Fannie, Freddie and Ginnie Mae for seamless pricing inquiries. As a result, we went live with 32 new price engine clients this year, accompanied by a strong pipeline of 19 others that are currently in the implementation phase. We also deployed our team to bring Black Knight's loan servicing onto our network, recently announcing the integration of Encompass underwriting system with the MSP servicing system, with documents now moving straight from origination through to servicing. Taking it a step further, we also incorporated DDA into MSP so that servicers can quickly identify any critical information that may be missing from a loan file as the documents progress. And we cemented this integration milestone with the signing of JPMorgan Chase to also utilize this platform for their servicing business. We continue to enhance the MSP loan servicing technology since our acquisition of Black Knight by investing in a new user interface called MSP DX. This interface modernizes access and control of the legacy loan servicing platform and streamlines key tasks across loan onboarding, investor reporting and customer service. It allows users to seamlessly retrieve data and evoke servicing actions through a conversational user interface. And its expanded capability facilitates loan triage, providing users with an efficient view of relevant information when working on loan exceptions. We've also further automated the credit dispute processes to help mortgage servicers meet their 30-day reporting obligations under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. Our expertise at digitization has led to continued innovation for the secondary market for home mortgages. In the third quarter, we went live with our MBS mortality indicator which leverages data sets across ICE Mortgage Technology and ICE Data Services to produce daily trading signals for agency residential MBS pools. We believe these signals are significantly more accurate at predicting near-term prepayments than the legacy products in the market. In summary, we've assembled and expanded a leading customer engagement suite, underwriting tools, pricing systems, closing tools, registration tools, servicing systems and the resulting data and integrated them into ICE's network for the U.S. mortgage industry. ICE brings together the key industry stakeholders from origination to final settlement in a single network ecosystem. That's roughly 85% of all U.S. home mortgages connected to more than 3,000 lenders, 48,000 settlement agents and closing attorneys, 2,500 county governments, the GSEs, 80,000 notaries, 100 loan servicing companies, 1,000 mortgage-backed security investment firms and thousands of third-party data and service providers who can now communicate with one another via a common data standard on a robust network operated under ICE's cyber overlay. We believe that we've created a platform where every new participant who joins this network makes the platform increasingly more valuable to its other users. Essentially, we've moved ICE from selling software to offering a growing network for the management of the home mortgage life cycle. Throughout this journey and consistent with our approach across other asset classes, we remain focused on executing on our strategy of relieving pain points across the mortgage workflow while investing ahead of secular growth to enhance the value proposition of our network. Turning now to Slide 10. Since our founding, ICE has operated with a strategy to build tools and markets for institutions and consumers which operate in the white space of the inefficiencies of legacy markets. We seek to do so in a manner that enables us to grow our earnings in all economic conditions so that ICE is truly an all-weather growth story. Our record third quarter following up on our unsurpassed first half results are a testament to the execution of this strategy, the business model that we've intentionally built and the value of our strategic capital allocation. It's how we've grown our adjusted earnings per share every year that we've been a public company. And finally, I'd like to retell you that a decade ago, ICE sought to expand in the global financial markets by merging LIFFE, the London International Financial Futures Exchange, with our London-based commodity exchange and clearinghouse in order to create a global risk management powerhouse. With great respect, I'd like to end my prepared remarks by acknowledging the contributions of Sir Brian Williamson and Hugh Freedberg who built, saved and nurtured that LIFFE exchange. This world recently lost both gentlemen. And I hope that as they look down upon us, they regard my colleagues and I as worthy stewards of their vision. And I hope they smile along with us at our record interest rate derivative activity in the third quarter, up 50% year-over-year. Let me now turn the call back to our moderator, Lydia and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 Eastern Time. Alex, this is Jeff. And since that's an unanswerable question, let's put the new guy on it and ask Stuart if he can handle it. That's a good question. I tried to make a point in my prepared remarks that we really have moved to operating a network. And I made the point that every new market participant that joins the network makes the network more valuable to all the existing participants. And so that phenomenon is not really volume related. It's really helping others take costs out. And our expectation is that as we help reduce the cost of underwriting and placing a mortgage into the capital markets, that we'll participate in some of that benefit. Separately, Warren talks a lot about normalizing transaction volumes. And when we look at that, you can simply look over a decade before the COVID crisis or even back to year 2022 and you can see volumes that had they run through our platform would have contributed substantially to both the top and bottom line. So we do feel like there will be a mean reversion that will get to transactions. It's obviously hard to predict. But in the meantime, we're going to just keep driving that efficiency through the network. Well, thank you, Lydia and thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to innovate for our customers and continue our momentum to drive growth with an all-weather business model. And I hope that today, you avoid the witches and zombies and have a safe Halloween."

            "name": "Stuart Williams",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. For over 2 decades, we've worked closely with our customers to develop a network of diverse liquid and globally interconnected energy markets. This network provides the critical feedback loop required to solve near-term supply and demand imbalances and the long-term price signals needed to efficiently allocate capital investment to meet forward-looking demand. Today, our customers across the globe leverage our markets to help balance the demands of energy security, affordability and sustainability while allocating the capital necessary to meet rising energy demands critical to economic growth and managing the risks associated with a complex geopolitical environment. The breadth and depth of our global platform not only drove another record quarter across our energy complex but importantly, it positions us to capture secular tailwinds, including the globalization of natural gas and the clean energy transition, trends we began investing in over a decade ago. Through constant reinvention and innovation, Brent has firmly established itself as the global benchmark for crude oil, pricing roughly 3/4 of the world's internationally traded crude and from which prices are discovered in the U.S. Gulf Coast via ICE's Midland WTI Futures market and in the Middle East and Asia via ICE's Murban and Dubai futures markets. Reflecting this dynamic, volume in our global oil complex increased 17% year-over-year. This strong performance includes records across Brent, WTI, Midland WTI and Murban and contributed to record oil revenues which grew 16% in the quarter. These strong trends have continued into October with record total oil open interest up 28% and Brent options up 68 -- 86% year-over-year. These critical pricing relationships extend to refined oil products where ICE's low sulfur gas oil markets similarly anchors price discovery for refined products globally with markets such as ICE's Heating Oil Futures and ICE Singapore Gasoil reflecting regional dynamics in the U.S. and Asia, respectively. We continue to see strong growth across refined products with Gasoil open interest up 63% year-over-year, supporting double-digit growth across the refined products complex, including growth in cleaner fuels such as ICE's global marine fuel and biofuel markets. Today, cleaner energy sources, including global natural gas and environmental markets, account for roughly 45% of our energy revenues, up from 1/3 a decade ago and have grown 21% on average over the past 5 years, including 34% growth year-to-date. This strong performance has been a key contributor to the 13% average growth rate in our energy platform over that time frame, including 29% growth year-to-date. The globalization of natural gas through liquefied natural gas or LNG has created virtual pipelines across oceans, removing the dependency on fixed pipeline infrastructure and storage. This, together with the ongoing liberalization of the natural gas market and buyers increasingly favoring short-term contracts and spot market procurement, has put the more natural gas in motion over longer distances with a greater number of touch points along the value chain from production to consumption, creating a truly global commodity. Furthermore, given its abundance, lower emissions and lower switching costs, we expect natural gas to continue to benefit from increasing energy demand, particularly in the developing world and the ongoing focus on decarbonization. Since the year 2000, energy consumption in non-OECD countries has more than doubled with much of this growth coming in the form of coal. Last year, global coal consumption hit an all-time high, primarily supported by Asia where coal still accounts for nearly 50% of the region's energy supply. According to statistics published by the Energy Institute, the coal switching opportunity in Asia alone represents more energy than the total energy consumption in North America across all primary energy sources. In addition, the power demands of accelerating innovation, including artificial intelligence, are expected to require significant new generation capacity boosting demand for natural gas. These factors have caused markets across Europe, Asia and North America to become increasingly interconnected, accelerating demand for deep, liquid and global risk management tools. This evolution has driven the development of new trading relationships, as illustrated by record participation in our natural gas portfolio in the third quarter. This has been accompanied by volume and revenue growth with each growing double digits on average over the past 5 years, including 34% and 32% growth year-to-date, respectively. In addition, open interest trends remained strong through October, up 27% year-over-year, including a 51% increase in our TTF complex, a 53% increase in our Asian JKM market and a 24% increase in our North American gas business. As the Brent of natural gas, our Title Transfer Facility benchmark, or TTF, continues to be relied upon by an increasing number of market participants with market participation growing 15% on average over the past 5 years. In the third quarter, volumes in our TTF complex increased 16% year-over-year, driving revenue growth of 19% versus 2023. In Asia, underpinned by surging economic growth and a focus towards cleaner forms of energy, our Japan and Korea market, or JKM, continues to reach important milestones, setting records across key liquidity indicators in the third quarter, including participation, volume and open interest. Importantly, the extent to which global gas markets are interconnected was once again reinforced by JKM execution patterns with over 60% of JKM volumes executed via the JKM TTF spread. In North America, market participants seeking to manage exposure to U.S. natural gas pricing dynamics continue to gravitate towards ICE's Henry Hub contracts for the liquidity ICE offers in longer-dated tenors, along with the linkage to our exclusive regional basis markets which spans 70 trading hubs across North America. In the third quarter, volume in our North American gas complex increased 39% year-over-year. Finally, with Canada expected to significantly ramp up its LNG export capacity from 2025, increased exports from the West Coast of North America to Asia should add a further dimension to the supply equation. ICE's Calgary-based Natural Gas Exchange, or ICE NGX, has operated in the Alberta natural gas and electricity futures market for 30 years, developing the AECO hub into one of North America's most liquid spot and forward energy markets. ICE offers liquid markets in TTF, JKM, Henry Hub and the North American basis markets such as AECO, offering a broad range of natural gas benchmarks with trading hubs across Europe, Asia and North America. As the global landscape of LNG exports, geopolitical forces and shift towards cleaner energy all continue to evolve, we see these dynamics continuing to favor our growing global gas complex well into the future. As policy discussions on how best to deliver global sustainability objectives continue to evolve, our liquid and transparent environmental markets, first launched almost 2 decades ago, continue to see growth, providing transparent, market-based pricing for both positive and negative externalities. Here, we have seen the number of active market participants grow double digits on average over the past 5 years, including record participation in the third quarter, up 14% year-over-year. At the same time, our North American environmental complex reached record volumes in the quarter, increasing 70% versus prior year. While volumes in our European emission allowance futures and options increased 45%, this strong performance has contributed to the 49% growth in our environmental revenues year-to-date, including 60% growth in the third quarter. In summary, as the confluence of increasing energy demand, evolving supply chains and the energy transition continues to introduce new complexities, uncertainties and volatility into energy markets, our global environmental markets, alongside our global gas, oil, coal and power markets, provide the critical price transparency and risk management tools that will enable participants to navigate this multilayered and nonlinear transition. Before I hand over to Jeff, I wanted to briefly touch on our interest rate markets which hit record volume during the quarter, increasing 50% year-over-year. A mixed inflation picture, low unemployment, weaker economic data and ongoing geopolitical uncertainty continue to drive demand for interest rate risk management. ICE's liquid, multicurrency, short-term interest rate complex includes the key benchmark Euribor, SONIA and SARON markets used to manage short-term interest rate risk in euros, pound sterling and Swiss francs, respectively. As the benchmark for managing short-term euro interest rate risk, ICE's Euribor volume increased 47% year-over-year in the third quarter with open interest up 15% in October. The latest addition to ICE's multicurrency STIR complex, the euro short-term rate, or ESTER, continues to break records across all liquidity metrics, including open interest hitting a record 681,000 contracts during October. ICE's SONIA market, the benchmark for managing U.K. interest rate risk, traded a record 14 million contracts in September, contributing to a 53% growth year-to-date. Trends towards the end of October remained robust with open interest up 71%. ICE also hosts the Gilt futures market, the benchmark for the U.K. government bond yield curve, where volume is up 30% year-to-date, including 42% growth in the third quarter with open interest up 92% year-over-year. The disparity between the expected relative parts for the central banks has been a consistent theme over the last year. This has been beneficial for our rates franchise, both in terms of volume and open interest and looks set to continue as our customers rely on the deep liquidity and capital efficiencies at ICE. With that, I'll hand it over to Jeff. Thanks, Jeff and thanks, Alex, for the question. It is a great question. Perhaps the way to think about this and I think you picked up on a really important point there, Alex, when you referenced open interest. So as unanswerable as it might be, open interest is always a good indicator of future volume because this is -- these are positions being placed by real market participants. And those positions will need to be managed in the future as markets evolve. But the other way we think about this is that there is a linkage between the geopolitical events which you referenced in your question which do create short-term volatility but which also creates often new supply chains which then will leverage other parts of that matrix product setup that we've got which spans energy types and geography and the environmental markets. So just giving you an example of that, one of the things we saw after Europe's efforts to remove Russian hydrocarbons from its supply chain, we saw new supply routes coming from the Middle East up into Europe which we've never foreseen when we first set up ICE Futures Abu Dhabi but that's what happened. And so what we find is a lot of these geopolitical events create different supply chain opportunities which continue to drive growth in different parts of our energy markets. The focus that we've had over the last 20 years, though, has been to create that network of markets that provides a pricing point at each geography, energy type and environmental touch point so that whatever happens, whether it's geopolitical, whether it's supply chain changes, however the market evolves, we have the opportunity to provide that tool to our customers and can benefit off the back of that. The other point I would make, just in closing the answer, is we're very clearly at an inflection point where the growth we've seen over the last 20 years in absolute energy consumption is set to continue. About 80% of the world's population lives in non-OECD countries which, on average, on a per capita basis, only uses 1/3 of the energy of the equivalent people living in OECD countries. Put differently, energy consumption could well double over the next 25 years according to many economists. And a lot of that is going to be in places in the developing world where contracts like JKM and TTF and Brent and Dubai and Murban are critical in managing price risks around those areas. So we feel pretty good about the opportunity ahead of us. But as you say, it's pretty difficult to quantify that. Chris, this is Stuart here. Thank you for the question. Starting with your question on the customer base, we're seeing, as you heard in my prepared remarks, we're seeing a significant increase and continued growth in our customer base. The participation in our markets, that's really 2 factors. We're seeing net new participants coming into our marketplace, particularly out in Asia as hedging strategies continue to mature out there. But we're also seeing participants pivot from markets they've been active in historically into new markets. So for example, people that have historically been trading a lot of Henry Hub on our very regular in our TTF market and getting involved there. In terms of how that mix evolves, more and more customers are having global exposures. One of the side effects of the globalization of gas is that gas players globally and particularly in the U.S., now that the U.S. is a major export of LNG, need to be cognizant of and have risks to manage in respect of prices, not just in the U.S. but globally. So we've got a lot of global producers in the U.S. that are now looking at both TTF numbers as well as Henry Hub numbers and indeed some of our basis numbers to figure out whether it's best to pipe that gas internally to whether it's for data center usage or other power usage in the U.S. or to export that in the form of LNG to whether it's Europe or Asia. So we're seeing a lot of our U.S. participants now actively trading and holding positions in markets like TTF and JKM. I think the other trend, just pivoting quickly to oil which has been very interesting, you'll recall that a few years ago, we set up a new market in the U.S. Gulf Coast to better reflect the export price of Permian WTI coming out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. And again, as the U.S. continues to export more and more Permian-grade WTI and as that grade is now linked into Brent, we're seeing a lot more physical participants in the U.S. Permian producers using our numbers to price their exports out of the U.S. Gulf Coast. You might have seen just this last week, the shale producer, Continental Resources, announced that it was switching its Permian pricing to ICE's HOU contract which is replacing a differential to WTI Cushing. So that's all pointing in a good direction at the increased participation. Just pivoting then to your second question around sustainable aviation fuel or SAF, it is definitely a market we're looking at. What I referenced in my prepared remarks around our biofuels markets which ICE is very active in, we're seeing strong growth there. So that will be the area that SAF plays into. And as you, again, you alluded to, we're seeing increasing correlation between the sugar markets and the energy markets as a decent chunk of that sugar supply ends up in energy. So you're quite right, this is an opportunity. It's early days in the SAF market. The market structure is still evolving in that space but we continue to monitor that as time goes on. Thanks, Simon. Good question. The -- I think the way we're thinking about this from a macro perspective and I'll drill down into your specific question on the European ETS, carbon pricing, well, our view as market operators is that carbon pricing is going to be the most effective way to help channel investments that are needed in order to drive the complete reduction of carbon. And we've seen this very effectively play out in the U.K. as the U.K. drove coal out of its merit order using carbon pricing, the European Union on a similar kind of trajectory. So what we're seeing over the last couple of years is the dialogue around the importance of pricing carbon and more broadly environmental externalities is evolving. More governments, more policymakers are engaging with the subject and seeing the benefits of cap-and-trade systems which have been so successful in Europe and the U.K. and also in certain areas of the U.S. And so we are seeing more discussions around more coverage of carbon markets. And then within existing carbon markets, touching on your question on the European ETS, we're seeing the broadening of the coverage of those carbon markets. So only about 40% of the European emissions was covered under the EU ETS. That is now being extended to 80% as the ETS extends to other parts of the industry like shipping and that sort of thing. So the underlying market, if you like, is expanding which is also driving additional volume there. And then, of course, the other nascent market in the space, if you think of the compliance markets as the one end of the spectrum, on the other end, the so-called voluntary carbon markets or the carbon credit markets is another area where we continue to see discussions. Market structure there, again, is still very nascent. But what we've been working on in the meantime is putting in place a number of the building blocks that will be required for that market to scale, if it is ever going to scale, things like reference data. So we've got a product called ICE CRED which normalizes and standardizes all of the reference data that's available across the carbon credit landscape. That reference data is now available in ICE Chat where we're seeing a lot of the transaction activity, really OTC bilateral trading activity of carbon credits, referencing that reference data. And we've also got a futures -- a number of futures contracts, including the CORSIA futures contract which we launched recently which is really the credit market used by the aviation industry. So again, that's the second part of the market which is much less mature but we are seeing increasing interest as participants start to engage with our reference data and with ICE Chat transactions on that front. Yes. Thanks for the question, Ken. I think the other dynamic to keep in mind when you're thinking about the volume on a futures contract versus the underlying market is the length of the curve. So we've got liquid pricing in TTF now going out 10 years. And so that's 10 years' worth of supply is the thing you need to be thinking about as you think about the hedging volumes on the exchange. But look, it's -- the thing that we -- the dynamic we're seeing is, as you said in your question, the demand for LNG is growing significantly and we see that as being a significant part of both the Asian growth story but also the Asian move to cleaner energies. So there's no question in our mind that LNG supply is going to need to increase significantly. The other dynamic here is because there is more liquid pricing in the marketplace, looking at the likes of TTF and JKM, more and more buyers and sellers are referencing TTF and JKM in the physical contracts. And so what that means is you're seeing less fixed price and more indexed transactions in the physical market which provides the optionality not just of taking LNG from point of production to point of demand but also you can, as you see in the oil market, have ships on route changing direction because odds have opened up. So what we're seeing in the gas market as part of this globalization story is a real modernization of the market structure where physical molecules are going to the best price. And as those prices evolve with greater transparency, those physical movements move with them. So net-net, what that means is there are more participants needing to hedge more molecules along more supply chain routes and we see that overall growing. And then again, to my earlier comments, liquidity down the curve is getting really strong. So we're seeing longer-dated hedging coming into the TTF contract as well."

Pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight, total revenue increased by 7% versus last year and is up 6% through the first half of 2024. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $947 million, up 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. As a result of this strong performance, adjusted pro forma operating income increased by 11% versus the prior year reaching a record $1.4 billion, with record adjusted earnings per share totaling $1.52. Moving to the balance sheet, adjusted leverage ended the second quarter at approximately 3.7 times pro forma EBITDA, a reduction from 3.9 times at the end of the first quarter and 4.3 upon the completion of Black Knight in the third quarter of 2023. Before I move to our segment results, I will note a few third quarter guidance items. We expect third quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $955 million to $965 million or at the midpoint, an increase of roughly 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, with growth across our Exchange and FID segments largely offset by expense synergies, which we now anticipate will exit 2024 at an annualized run rate of over $150 million, up from prior expectations of $135 million. Relative to the second quarter, we expect the sequential increase to be driven by higher occupancy costs, slightly higher compensation, including an accrual for our strong performance year-to-date and higher depreciation expense as revenue related data center investments continue to come online. Moving below the line, adjusted non-operating expense is expected to be between $190 million to $195 million, driven by lower interest expense as we continue to direct free cash flows to reducing debt outstanding. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Second quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of $884 million were up 20%, driven by a 40% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues, which grew 33% year-over-year. This strong energy performance included a 30% increase in our oil complex, 32% growth in global natural gas revenues and 64% growth in our environmental business. In addition, as of the end of July, open interest is up 20% year-over-year, including 21% growth in global interest rates and 25% growth in our energy markets. Shifting to recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business, revenues totaled $362 million in the second quarter. Mid-single-digit growth in our broader exchange data services was underpinned by high-single-digit growth in futures data, in part driven by the continued expansion of our global energy and environmental network. In our listings business, SPAC delistings and the rolling off of 2021 admission fees offset a solid quarter for new listings. Through the first half and despite only half of IPOs eligible to list, the NYC has helped raise $12 billion in new proceeds, welcoming 30 new operating companies, including seven of the top ten IPOs. Absent a sharp recovery in IPOs in the second half, we would expect the listings revenues to trend around current levels through the balance of this year. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our fixed income and Data Services segment. Second quarter revenues totaled $565 million. Transaction revenues totaled $108 million. Transaction revenue growth at ICE bonds was once again driven by strong growth across both corporates and munis, particularly our institutional channel, which grew double-digits year-over-year. Record recurring revenues totaled $457 million and grew by 5% year-over-year, slightly ahead of expectations. In our Fixed Income Data and Analytics business, record second quarter revenues of $293 million increased by 6% year-over-year and was driven by growth in pricing and reference data, another quarter of double-digit growth in our index business, and higher than anticipated one-time revenue. Other Data and Network Services grew 5% in the second quarter, driven by our consolidated fees business and continued strength in our oil and gas desktop solutions, both of which are products that we have invested in organically enhancing both content and functionality. Total ASV or annual subscription value, exited the quarter up 4% year-over-year, coupled with visibility into our sales pipeline for the balance of this year and assuming flat markets, we are on track to grow total Fixed Income and Data Services recurring revenue around the middle of our mid-single-digit guidance range, an improvement from 3% growth in 2023. Please flip to Slide 7, where I'll discuss the results of our Mortgage Technology segment. ICE Mortgage Technology revenues were over $506 billion in the second quarter. Recurring revenues totaled $387 million. Relative to the first quarter, revenue from new customers coming online was offset by attrition within our data and document automation product or DDA, and was primarily related to non-encompassed customer on our legacy platform, who was not utilizing DDA's full capabilities. Despite this attrition, quarterly sales of DDA were the strongest since early 2022, including the signing of JPMorgan Chase, a current user of DBA on the origination side, to utilize the platform for their servicing business, a win that is a testament to past investments and synergies with MSP. In addition, while the majority of customers continue to renew at higher minimums, similar to the last few quarters, we also saw customers renew lower. It's important to note that lower minimums are paired with a higher transaction fee or price per closed loan and net total contract value, assuming normal market conditions continues to increase upon renewal. Transaction revenues totaled $119 million in the second quarter, while revenues related to encompass closed loans, applications and MERS registrations increased in the low single-digits on a year-over-year basis and increased well into the double-digits sequentially. Growth was somewhat offset by transaction revenues related to the aforementioned DNA attrition, as well as lower default management revenues within our servicing business. While the mortgage origination market is trending below historical levels and refinance ways can be difficult to predict, we are seeing encouraging signs that fundamentals are stabilizing. According to ICE Mortgage Technology Data, while still below pre-COVID levels, the number of homes on the market continues to grow, up nearly 40% versus this time last year. In addition, tappable home equity hit record levels at the end of June, reaching $11.5 trillion with over 30 million homeowners with at least $100,000 to draw down upon. And we estimate that the number of borrowers with an incentive to refinance at current rates is at its highest level in two years, driven by slightly lower interest rates and a building backlog of higher rate purchase loans. And so we continue to invest in product development and enhancement and we continue to expand our existing network, all which further position our platform to realize accelerating growth when market conditions normalize. In summary, we delivered a record first half. We once again delivered revenue growth, operating income growth and free cash flow growth. We continue to invest across our business to meet the needs of our customers and to position our business to continue to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our stockholders into the future. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now I'll hand it over to Ben.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thank you, Warren and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. In the more than 20 years ICE has been building its global energy platform. We have strategically positioned our energy business for the globalization of natural gas and the societal demand for a transition to clean energies. Our long-term strategic direction and the value of our diverse, deep and liquid markets contributed to record trading volumes across our energy complex in the second quarter. This was a key driver to another quarter of record energy revenues, up 33% year-over-year and growing double-digits on average over the past five years. This strong performance is a testament to our customers continued confidence in ICE as the global energy hedging venue of choice. And with open interest continuing to set records into July, up 25% year-over-year, our energy complex appears poised for continued strength. As the world evolves, market participants are constantly adjusting and weighing the price impact of an array of macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory forces, as well as externalities such as climate risk and the emergence of new renewable fuel sources. In essence, the price formation process is increasingly becoming more complex, and that additional complexity is driving customer demand for more precise risk management tools. It is also driving demand for customers to come to a single place to manage risk across oil, gas, power and environmentals because of the efficiency and deep liquid markets that we provide. Across natural gas, the evolution of a global market is accelerating. This acceleration is underpinned by the rise of liquefied natural gas, market based pricing and more recently, Europe's renewed openness to gas imports after the elimination of Russia as a key supplier and the emergence of North America as a leading natural gas exporter. Alongside this, as an important partner fuel, emitting about half as much carbon dioxide as coal to produce, natural gas continues to benefit from demand for cleaner fuels as countries move to reduce their carbon emissions. Additionally, the natural gas markets were historically regional oriented, each characterized by distinct pricing and supply dynamics. All these factors underpin the emergence of three key benchmarks for natural gas across North America, Europe and Asia, with these becoming increasingly interconnected. In Europe, our Title Transfer Facility contract or TTF is a central trading point for natural gas, just as Brent is the global benchmark for oil pricing. As a result, TTF is increasingly being used by global commercial participants, traders and investors, with a record number of market participants in the second quarter that has doubled since 2019. This has been accompanied by volumes and open interest increasing, with both setting new highs in the second quarter and each are growing double-digits on average over the past five years. In Asia, our Japan, Korea Marker, or JKM, reflects the spot market value of cargoes delivered into the region that represents a key demand center for LNG, underpinned by surging economic growth and increasing focus on environmental concerns. In 2023, global coal consumption reached its highest level in history driven by continued growth in Asia. While coal continues to be replaced by natural gas and other cleaner energy sources in Europe and North America, it still accounts for 47% of primary energy consumption in Asia. In absolute terms, the coal switching opportunity in Asia alone represents more energy than the total energy consumption in North America across all primary energy sources. Today, the relationship between our TTF and JKM benchmarks drives global price formation. Reflecting this dynamic, ICE's JKM volumes have shifted from being roughly 50% composed of the JKM TTF spread to closer to two thirds. This dynamic also illustrates market confidence in relying on TTF as a benchmark for global gas and LNG prices as participants draw assurance from its deep liquidity, rather than relying on the Asian marker in isolation. In North America, we began preparing for the liberalization of natural gas and its evolution beyond the Henry Hub benchmark more than a decade ago. Through close collaboration with our customers, we created ICE's electronic regional basis markets, a suite of precise risk management tools reflecting the commercially relevant supply and demand dynamics of 70 hubs across North America. These hubs are priced at a differential to Henry hub to reflect U.S. regional market conditions, transportation costs and transmission capacity between locations. Alongside this, many market participants seeking to manage exposure to U.S. natural gas price dynamics, gravitate towards ICE's Henry Hub contracts for liquidity and the linkage to our exclusive basis markets. As the global landscape of LNG exports, geopolitical forces and shifts to cleaner energy sources all continue to evolve, we see these dynamics underpinning the strong momentum for this business and we see these trends continuing to favor our growing global gas complex well into the future. The importance of the evolution of energy markets extends to our global environmental markets where the number of market participants has nearly doubled since 2019, setting an all-time high in the second quarter and increasing 18% year-over-year. At the same time, volumes increased 61% in the quarter, including growth across our regional greenhouse gas initiative allowances, California carbon allowances as well as our EU and UK allowances. This strong performance has contributed to a 43% increase in environmental revenues year-to-date, including 64% growth in the second quarter. In parallel, across our power markets, volumes increased 32% in the first half, including 51% growth in the second quarter. With AI and data center build outs expected to drive meaningful power demand into the next decade, our platform is uniquely positioned to capture this tailwind and help market participants manage this potentially volatile growth story, given that ICE is the most comprehensive platform that offers U.S. regional gas markets alongside deep and liquid power and environmental markets. In summary, for market participants seeking to manage their risk, ICE's global energy platform offers over 1000 futures and options contracts across natural gas, power, environmental and oil markets, supporting the growing complexity of energy markets and uniquely positioning us to benefit from both near-term volatility and secular growth trends occurring across these markets. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business, our quality pricing and reference data, combined with over 40 years of price history, serve as the foundation for what is today one of the largest providers of fixed income indices globally. Year-to-date, revenue in our index business is up double digits, with passive ETF assets under management benchmark to our indices growing to a record $616 billion through the end of the second quarter, from less than $100 billion in 2017 and doubling since 2020. In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments made to enhance content and functionality across our other data and network services business. As an example, within our consolidated fees business, investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering have directly contributed to the double-digit revenue growth in this area year-to-date. With content from over 600 data sources, our offering gives customers access to a broad universe of low latency financial information with full depth of market data. As firms seek more high quality data from a range of different sources in a cost efficient manner, our competitive and comprehensive offering stands to benefit. While our consolidated fees and index businesses are smaller components of our comprehensive data platform today, they're both well positioned to continue to grow and capture market share while also serving an important role in our broader enterprise sales strategy. Turning now to our mortgage business, the secular shift towards the adoption of an electronic workflow continues. With a life of loan offering that spans from point of consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary market, our platform is uniquely positioned to play a fundamental role. In the second quarter, we closed on 29 new Encompass clients as customers focus on modernizing their infrastructure and on workflow efficiencies. Building on wins announced last quarter, such as Citizens Bank and Webster Bank, we are pleased to announce that mortgage Solutions of Colorado has signed on to Encompass expanding on the MSP win we announced late last year. We have also just signed another top 15 home builder in the U.S. to Encompass and our DDA platform, making them the 9th homebuilder of the top 15 to join our community. In addition, as mentioned last quarter, we've been integrating our tax, flood and closing fees data into Encompass, providing customers with more choice of service providers on our platform. In that regard, we're encouraged by the early traction in our cross-sell efforts across these offerings, executing on 200 data cross-sells to Encompass clients in the first half. While these offerings are small components of our business today, these wins give us confidence in our ability to execute on the synergy targets that we laid out at the time of the Black Knight transaction. Along the same lines, following the first integration of Encompass to MSP by leveraging our data and document automation platform for loan onboarding straight from origination through to servicing, we are pleased to announce that we signed JPMorgan Chase onto this service. For our traditional DDA business we also had 12 new wins to new and existing Encompass clients in the second quarter alone. In summary, we are pleased to see the value of our platform and solutions are providing by our comprehensive technology platform that it's resonating in the marketplace. With a touch point to nearly every market participant, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital solutions provide. As these new customers come onto our network, we have the opportunity to expand the customer relationship over time as they adopt additional solutions. Just as we've seen in our other markets, this flywheel effect gives us confidence that we can grow our business that today is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that's in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Thank you, Ben. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 9. At ICE, our mission for more than 20 years has been to drive transparency and create workflow efficiencies for our customers. We do this by building and operating mission critical digital networks that leverage our technology, data and operating expertise. At the time of our IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005, we were purely an energy exchange offering only a handful of products to a narrow customer base. Since then, our focus has been building a global platform that has the asset class breadth to enable us to pursue growth opportunities quickly and efficiently as they emerge around the world and deliver all weather results. While we're known for some of our larger scale acquisitions, we have also completed a wide range of smaller bolt-on transactions. We reimagine these businesses by leveraging technology and crafting significant product development to drive organic growth, further bolstering the content on our networks and accelerating our broadening into new asset classes. Operating marketplaces with strong network effects is a core expertise at ICE, and today we do so across an array of asset classes, geographies and customer types. Optimizing the operation of financial services databases helps drive market transparency and this transparency attracts additional participant, which in turn improves market liquidity. It's a virtuous cycle that continuously expands the network while strengthening the market. Starting with our commodities business in 2001, we acquired the International Petroleum Exchange, which brought us both proprietary content in the form of the Brent Crude Index, as well as connectivity to a broad network of energy traders and commercial customers. Building on that foundation, we organically developed and grew hundreds of precise hedging instruments to serve the evolving needs of this commercial customer base. Today, the original Brent crude contract trades alongside our Midland WTI, Cushing WTI, Platts Dubai and Middle East Murban grades of crude to additionally support over 800 related commodity products developed by ICE, giving participants the ability to manage the price of energy at the point of consumption or production around the world.\nNYBOT: Starting from a simple idea, we have grown it into one of the largest clearinghouses in the world. Our experience in building, trading, clearing and settlement infrastructure highlighted for us the importance of analytics, indices and trade valuation services and in 2015, we broadened our addressable market moving into fixed income with the acquisition of Interactive Data Corporation. IDC's pricing and reference data businesses are key to transparent price formation in the fixed income markets. They laid the foundation for our expansion into the adjacent index business and the development of a comprehensive platform that today we've grown to nearly 500 unique institutional grade data products. Another example of ICE leveraging our technology and infrastructure is our June 24 announcement to apply our proven track record, our expertise in central clearing and our connectivity to the fixed income markets to launch a clearing service for U.S. treasury securities and repurchase agreements. The U.S. treasury and repo markets are critical to the global collateral management infrastructure and we are significant users of these treasury products across our six clearinghouses. A new SEC rule beginning in 2025 sheds light on the fact that no existing clearing offering is compliant with the rule, opening an opportunity for ICE. We look forward to working with our clients and the entire treasury ecosystem to deliver on this innovation. Following the proven playbook we've applied across futures and fixed income markets and by leveraging our expertise in building new technology, we've expanded into the U.S. consumer interest rate markets by developing a digital financing infrastructure for home mortgages. In 2016, we acquired a majority position in the Mortgage Electronic Registry System. We applied ICE's technology expertise to rebuild and modernize its platform and database, allowing us to buy the remaining business stake in 2018. We've since bought and built our way into further market exposure that culminated with the completion of our acquisition of Black Knight last year. Today, these assets are part of our broader ICE Mortgage Technology business that we believe is uniquely positioned at the center of an asset class that is moving from analog to digital. The breadth and depth of what we have assembled touches nearly every home mortgage in the United States and includes the largest network of partners that every day ensure that our thousands of customers can efficiently engage, originate, close, finance, value and sell consumer home loans. Our approach to overlaying organic growth on our strategic acquisitions is deliberate and comprehensive, allowing us to construct a platform that not only generates strong returns and healthy cash flows, but is also positioned to continue to leverage our core strengths to generate future growth. Our first half results are another example of strong execution of this proven strategy. We delivered record revenues, record adjusted operating income and record adjusted earnings per share. These record setting results reflect the strength of our network and the all-weather nature of our business model. As we've grown and diversified, we've broadened our opportunity set and our expertise has grown, yielding new markets to grow into and new ways to deliver innovative solutions to our customers. Our evolution has been intentional, diversifying across asset classes and geographies and increasing our mix of recurring revenues with a goal of building a business that today generates compounding earnings growth. Looking to the second half of the year and beyond, we're excited about the many growth opportunities that are in front of us, and we remain focused on delivering innovative solutions for our customers while driving compounding all-weather growth for our stockholders. Before I end my prepared remarks, I'd like to say thank you to our customers for their business and for their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contribution to both the best single quarter and the best first half in our company's history. With that, I'll turn the call back to our moderator, Drew, and we'll conduct a question and answer session until 09:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\nNYBOT's: Starting from a simple idea, we have grown it into one of the largest clearinghouses in the world.

[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Craig Siegenthaler from Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nCraig Siegenthaler: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Our question is on the fixed income business. So we've seen a nice acceleration in fixed income ASV this year. What's driving this? Which channels are seeing the most growth and to what extent is the growth stemming from pricing versus cross-sell versus new clients?\nWarren Gardiner: Hey, Craig, I'll start that one off. This is Warren. So it's been pretty broad based across the recurring revenue base within that segment and so we've seen some improvements in the PRV [ph] business. As you know, last few years, the fixed income ecosystem has been facing a number of headwinds given the sharp rise in interest rates and so as we've seen that taper off, we've seen a reengagement from that customer base which has helped on the new sales front and we've seen some improvements there, certainly over the last couple of quarters it's helped. The other area that's been helpful as well is on the index side, where the last year or so we had faced some headwinds there, largely just due to markets and things of that nature, where we've seen that now reverse and obviously fund flows into fixed income funds as well has been a helpful component of that from a growth perspective. And then I'd also say within the Other Data Network services, within our desktop business, our fees business, which you heard us highlight, we've seen some really strong trends there as well and that's really a result of some of the investments we've made over the last number of years to get those into better positions. So we've been pretty pleased with that progress. I think we certainly did face some headwinds last year at a macro level and as you've seen those abate, you've seen improvement in the revenue trends and the ASV trends. And I think one thing that ASV doesn't necessarily always pick up or doesn't pick up, I mean, it's a good metric, it's not perfect, is that sales that we've made that have not yet implemented. And so as we mentioned last quarter, we do think on the connectivity side related to some of our data center investments, we'll see some of those sales start to implement in the third and the fourth quarter. That will be a little bit of help as well. So we're encouraged by that as we look into the back half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ken Worthington from JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nKen Worthington: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. You mentioned that you expanded the Chase relationship as another win this quarter. So maybe first, how does the institutional pipeline look for Encompass in MSP? Is it building? Is it stable or is ICE just really working through that existing pipeline? And then second, ICE has a number of larger mortgage wins that you've announced over the last 18 months. What is the magnitude of the impact we should expect as these clients go live on transaction and recurring revenue over the second half of this year or maybe into the first six months of next year as these new larger relationships are launched?\nJeffrey Sprecher: Thanks, Ken. I'll start and then Warren will pick up on the second part of that question. So we're very pleased with the expansion of the relationship with JPMorgan Chase. Obviously, they're been a longtime MSP client. They've added Encompass across all channels and have added DDA for the origination side and now are leveraging DDA as that integration point to automatically onboard loans from Encompass into MSP. So that's a great win for us and it's really in line with the vision of why we put together all these assets is to provide the efficiency that these platforms provide for institutions. And in terms of the funnel behind that, we continue, as you've seen each quarter, announcing new wins. And whether it's MSP wins for clients that have historically been on Encompass, and we've had a great relationship with or the other way around, clients that have been on MSP that are signing on to Encompass, we're very pleased with the success that we've had out of the gate, and we continue to see that funnel building and it's building in a couple of different ways. It's building from clients that realize they don't need to have their own in-house bespoke systems. That's oftentimes what we're replacing in particular on the very large institutional side for this. And really the secret sauce should be how do they cross-sell to their clients and understand more about that overall relationship across the institutional enterprise that those banks have with the clients, as opposed to coming up with some unique way to run a loan origination system or a servicing system. So that funnel continues to build. We feel good about that on both sides, on both MSP and Encompass, and with a number of the wins that we've had and that you've even referenced in your question, we have a lot of those going through implementations, and as you can appreciate, we have a large backlog of those implementations. They're going very well. They just take time. They're very complex. There's a lot of compliance aspects in and around mortgage in fact in most areas that these banks work. Mortgage is probably one of the most heavily compliance -- areas of compliance they have to comply with. So those implementations take time. And I'll hand the second part of it off to Warren.\nWarren Gardiner: Yeah. So Ken, on your question around the size of some of the wins and maybe how the cadence of how those will kind of come into the run rate, so I think, look, back in the fourth quarter, we talked about revenue synergies around $30 million. I can tell you that we've continued to add to that number and made progress against that number. That's something I'll probably give more on an annual basis in terms of the actual number, but I can tell you that we have been making progress over the last couple of quarters there. Like I said back then as well, we wouldn't expect, we don't expect a material impact this year from those revenue synergies. MSP products Encompass, they can tend to take six to 18 months, if not longer, particularly for ones that are larger, which is what a lot of these wins that we've talked about are. And so it does take time to implement that technology and that's part of why you're seeing those kind of take some time to get into the run rate. And so we'll expect those to start to come in 2025 and 2026, as obviously those companies come online and that will flow into recurring revenue at that point.\nOperator: Our next question is from Dan Fannon from Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nDan Fannon: Thanks. Good morning. So another question on mortgage. I was hoping you could flush out a little bit of what transpired, I think in the quarter with you talked about a client leaving, so we wanted to get a bit of an update more broadly on the kind of renegotiations and where you are, you think, in the overall customer base for the new minimums. And as you think about the recurring revenue mix, is that, I guess, do you anticipate more kind of fluctuations and/or fits and starts as you kind of go through that process, as we look kind of prospectively from here?\nBenjamin Jackson: Sure, Dan, this is Ben. I'll take this one. So I'll start with the second part of it on the renegotiations and Warren mentioned it in his prepared remarks as well. We continue on the Encompass side to see the majority of the clients. So the number of clients that are renewing are renewing at higher subscriptions. And when that happens, we have a lower foreclosed loan fee is typically the trade-off there, but we do have a percent that we've seen in similar the last few quarters that are choosing to renew at lower minimums, lower subscription fees. And the trade-off there is higher foreclosed loan fees. And as the market normalizes, the algorithm that we have is the total contract value going to go up and that's what we're consistently targeting and executing against. So we're seeing that trend in terms of renegotiation continue. And it's been very much in line with what we've seen in past quarters. On the attrition that Warren mentioned in his prepared remarks that was on the DDA side. So with that data and document automation platform, this is a platform that Ellie Mae acquired a number of years ago, and there are some legacy clients on that platform that don't utilize the automation capabilities that that platform has in line with Encompass or with MSP. They're using it in isolation and that's where we saw the attrition happened with one client that Warren referenced. The other opportunity that we see here though, is that we had another client that was very similarly situated to that one that we engaged with very deeply and convinced them to change their loan origination provider from where they were in the past to moving over to Encompass and couple that with the DDA platform and we were successful in doing that. And in the second quarter, that's the Citizens Bank win that I had referenced was exactly that. We renegotiated a DDA contract, brought them on to Encompass, and have a much more longer term strategic relationship with the client.\nWarren Gardiner: And then Dan, just a comment on recurring revenue. I think that starts to stabilize around here as we move through the back half. Obviously the market environment is weighed versus what we were thinking later last year when we spoke to you guys about or early this year when we spoke to you guys about what we thought the recurring revenue would look like for the year. I noted a few points in my script supporting that. We've seen some stabilization in those fundamentals and actually more directly related to us through the first half of this year, we've seen an increase in loans originated on Encompass. We've seen an increase in apps on Encompass, and that's encouraging. That's the first time we've seen a year-over-year increase since early 2021. Some early signs that things are stabilizing and I think a more stable market is going to give people a little bit more reason to start to think about the future, plan for the future, and start to invest in some of these products, like a DDA, which I said had its best quarter in two years for sales. And so look M&A like we had a few quarters ago or last quarter, cancellations like we had this quarter on the DDA side that can be tough to predict. But for instance, that is, I think, as Ben said, there's a small amount of customers that are on DDA that don't use Encompass or MSP now. So attrition like we saw this quarter in that way, kind of seems less likely to be ahead when moving forward. And also, as I said, we won't expect to see some of those revenue synergies come in until next year. So at this point, it feels like we see some stabilization and looking forward to 2025 as those start to hit.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nKyle Voigt: Hey, good morning. Maybe just sticking on mortgage tech, in the past you've spoken about the significant kind of data exhaust that's generated by this combined Mortgage Technology business. I guess with Black Knight now having been closed for, I guess, roughly ten months, can you just speak a bit of more about how your thinking has evolved around the best ways to potentially monetize this mortgage data, whether that's new product launches or other areas of opportunity?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Kyle. This is Ben. So we see a number of different opportunities in this area and I'll describe a few. Some that are very near-term and I mentioned this in my script as well, is that we saw an opportunity to take a bunch of data sets that Black Knight's data business had and integrate them onto Encompass. We had that as part of our plan even before we closed as part of the integration strategy. That was one of the first things we were going to do. We executed on that. We just closed last September, got all those data sets onto Encompass for the first time. And in the first half of this year, we've had 200 cross-sells of flood data and fees, data sets that traditionally were not on Encompass to our Encompass customer base. So that's -- and there's a long runway to go on that when you think of 3000 Encompass customers and each of those data sets being cross-sell opportunities, there's a good runway ahead of us on that. The second thing that we executed on and we're very pleased with is, there's a data set within Black Knight that are AVMs, so they're valuations on homes. And with the trend right now with the amount of equity built up in homes, we've built a straight through service around home equity lines of credit that take our AVMs. So you can take the current valuation on a home, the servicer can take that information plus the data they know on the customer, present an offer for a home equity line of credit for a client and then feed that information directly into the origination platform as our Encompass platform handles home equity lines of credit seamlessly and then as those loans are originated, pass those straight through into servicing. So the AVMs are definitely a key component of that and home equity lines of credit is something that we're seeing are very popular right now. Longer term one of the things that we did strategically when we integrated these businesses, we took that Black Knight data business and we moved it into our Fixed Income and Data Services business with Chris and we just did that at the beginning of this year. The reason for that is we believe there's a lot of data sets within there, within Black Knight that traditionally have been sold to mortgage specific companies that have a lot of capital markets applicability and those are data sets like they're called McDash. There's another one called AFT, and another one EMBS. And all of them in a sense are predicting prepayments on loans or portfolio of loans or portfolios of mortgage backed securities. And obviously with our Fixed Income and Data Services business, we have a very significant business in pricing and reference data around mortgage backed securities. We have a whole community of customers with thousands of them that consume our Fixed Income and Data Services products. And that's where we're introducing the products as they are today, but also engaging with clients to get feedback on new services that we can build for more of a medium term opportunity. So those are some of the ones off the top of my head.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Allen from Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nChris Allen: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping we could dig into the growth in energy OI seemed really impressive growth since the middle of 2023. Any color, just in terms of whether it's new commercials coming on, hedging by existing market participants taking up maybe impact of macro funds. And also could you dig in a little bit on North American options OI which is up very nicely. What's been driving that? Does that have to, is that factoring into the complexity, increasing complexity, which Ben referenced earlier?\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks for the question. So you've heard us over a number of different calls in a number of different years, point to the fact that the major difference that you see in the way that we've developed our energy markets, whether you're talking oil, gas and also the products like power and environmentals, we have focused on the commercial customer at the core. And that's why we've built out and not dependent on just one benchmark for the growth of our business. We've built out thousands of hedging products around the world across oil, gas, power emissions, is that our customers want to be able to hedge at the point of production or consumption, as Jeff referred to even in his prepared remarks today. And it's those customers that we've really been building open interest around our platform. And obviously as open interest builds, as liquidity builds the platform, that's when you start to get also people that are taking more of a directional view on the market start to come in as well. But the leading people are the commercials and when we talk about even the success that we've had in our natural gas markets that started with a heavy, heavy commercial base. Our sweet spot in the U.S. has been the regional basis markets. Customers utilize those. And when they're trading that as a package with Henry Hub, that's what's helped to build out our Henry Hub market, because they want to do both of those trades in the same location. The same is true with the development of TTF and now with U.S natural gas moving around the world in the form of LNG and Europe consuming more U.S. LNG than from any other source and then also that coal switching opportunity that I mentioned in my prepared remarks across Asia being the size of North America itself, all of this is pointed at the commercial market participants that started in JKM and TTF has built up open interest in those products. And then we've obviously had directional traders flow in behind that. So that's a little color on that front. And on the options front, we're pleased with our options growth across the entire portfolio. Today there are a lot of risks that people need to manage. You have geopolitical risk with multiple wars going on. You've got political risks with elections pending and what that's going to mean for energy policy. And you have financial risks around what's going to happen with interest rates and all these have an impact. And options can be a very efficient way to hedge and manage risk in those situations.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ben Budish from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBenjamin Budish: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking the question. Ben, I was wondering if you could unpack the Asia opportunity a little bit more and maybe talk about the historical correlation between consumption of electricity and energy and trading volumes. When we look at sort of the European data, it looks like consumption of natural gas is pretty flat over a long period of time, but your volumes are up very meaningfully over a similar period of time. Presumably a pickup in consumption, really anywhere, would be quite positive. But how do you think about the correlation? How much could that drive volumes versus things like price volatility? How much those relative factors matter? Thank you.\nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Ben. Yes, those dynamics definitely matter. When people are looking at and whether you're a power producer or a consumer, the mix of things that you need to think about in trading is not only the power, the price of power itself, but also what's producing it, whether it's coal or switching to natural gas as a much cleaner fuel. And then also the dynamic around the world of also having to put a price on carbon emissions that are also a part of that. So traders that are thinking about this, hedgers that are thinking about their exposure in the energy markets have to think about all four of those dynamics. And we for many years have thought from engaging with our clients that that's the mix of risks that need to be managed. And that's why we've built out a business that includes all of those aspects to enable traders to hedge and manage that risk in one platform. And I'll even use the U.S. as a good example. I mean, if you look at the U.S., there has been a shift towards cleaner sources in gas. It's clear if you talk to any of the analysts out there that power consumption is going to continue to grow in the U.S. And one of the underlying reasons for that is data center demand. It's analysts' estimates that U.S. power is expected to increase. Power demand is going to increase over the next decade. And data center demand alone associated to that is likely 19 gigawatts last year to growing to up to 35 gigawatts by the end of this decade. And then underneath that you have natural gas demand that's linked to power generation. That today is around 35 billion cubic feet is expected from analysts estimates to grow to 45 billion cubic feet by the end of this decade. And then obviously you have markets like our environmental markets that continue to do well. Like our Reggie markets and our California carbon emissions. So I think that's a good story to tell because we see that story developing in Europe. We see that story developing in Asia and the mix of having U.S. basis markets, power, Henry and environmental markets all in one place and enabling customers to hedge and manage this risk in an efficient basis is what enables us to do this and provide those services to clients.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Kramm from UBS. Please go ahead.\nAlex Kramm:\nMr:\nCooper:\nWarren Gardiner: Thanks Alex, I'll start. So in particular in the servicing business you do have mortgage servicing rights that trade and move between clients and we're a beneficiary if those mortgage servicing rights move to servicers that are on MSP and it's the opposite if they're nothing. We -- and I think I've mentioned this on the last call, the first half this year we did see some impact on the servicing side of the business where there was a major bank had been very public about the fact that they were exiting their correspondent business and selling those MSRs. So that had some headwinds to us that hit us the first half of this year.\nRoundPoint: These tend to ebb and flow on us and off of us. On the Mr. Cooper question that you had, we have a deep relationship with Mr. Cooper. They've been a customer of ours for a number of years on Encompass. They also use our foreclosure and bankruptcy solutions within servicing. So we have a good relationship with them and we look forward to seeing what their plans are in the future. But as it relates to customers leaving us and choosing a different platform, we're not seeing that type of impact.\nBenjamin Jackson: And then Alex, just to give you on Flagstar our total ICE mortgage technology revenues.\nAlex Kramm: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Alex Blostein from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open, please go ahead.\nAlex Blostein: Hi, good morning. Thanks for the question. So maybe just zooming out on energy for a second, revenue growth up 30% or something like that this year, OI is trending something similar to that. I think we talked a lot about some of the structural tailwinds that are supporting this growth. But as you guys sort of zoom out and you extrapolate this further out, how do you think about the energy revenue growth algorithm over the next couple of years? And is 2024 a good base in your view, to build off of? I know the market tends to mean revert some of the dynamics and the trading space, but it doesn't feel like that's exactly what's happening here. Thanks.\nBenjamin Jackson: Hi Alex, it's Ben. Thanks for the question. What we always look at is the health of open interest across our markets as the barometer and really the predictor for future volumes and future volume potential for our markets. And if you look across our marketplace now, overall across all of our futures business, open interest versus last year is up 20%. In energy it's up 25%. So to us those are great indicators that we're doing the right things, partnering with our customers, developing out all of these very new innovations and new products and more precision in the way that customers can manage and hedge their risk around the world. The development of new products in oil have been really exciting for us with what we've innovated with our HOU contract, pricing Midland WTI basis, Houston, which is now flowing into dated Brent. And that market is growing phenomenally for us up 400% in open interest. You look at the development of our Murban contract that we innovated three years ago, pricing Middle Eastern crude going to Asia, ADVs in that contract are up 160%. All of our swaps to futures markets, these are all refined products and base markets continue to grow really nice for us in oil. In natural gas we continue to innovate and continue to introduce new contracts, new LNG contracts. We've talked about the development of JKM, the development of our TTF contract. All of these in our minds create a flywheel effect because anybody that's trading in these energy markets wants to put a price on oil, power, gas emissions, and it's so much more efficient for them to do that all in one place. So I'd point to the innovation that we've had. The open interest growth there has also fed into the growth of our benchmark contracts as well.\nOperator: That concludes today's Q&A session. I will now hand back over to Jeff Sprecher for closing remarks.\nJeffrey Sprecher: Well, thank you, Drew, for managing the call. And I want to thank you all for joining us this morning. And we look forward to updating you again very soon as we continue to innovate for our customers and build our all-weather business model to continue to drive growth. With that, I hope you'll have a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect your line.",

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our record quarterly results. Second quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.3 billion. Pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight, total revenue increased by 7% versus last year and is up 6% through the first half of 2024. Second quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $947 million, up 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis. As a result of this strong performance, adjusted pro forma operating income increased by 11% versus the prior year reaching a record $1.4 billion, with record adjusted earnings per share totaling $1.52. Moving to the balance sheet, adjusted leverage ended the second quarter at approximately 3.7 times pro forma EBITDA, a reduction from 3.9 times at the end of the first quarter and 4.3 upon the completion of Black Knight in the third quarter of 2023. Before I move to our segment results, I will note a few third quarter guidance items. We expect third quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $955 million to $965 million or at the midpoint, an increase of roughly 1% year-over-year on a pro forma basis, with growth across our Exchange and FID segments largely offset by expense synergies, which we now anticipate will exit 2024 at an annualized run rate of over $150 million, up from prior expectations of $135 million. Relative to the second quarter, we expect the sequential increase to be driven by higher occupancy costs, slightly higher compensation, including an accrual for our strong performance year-to-date and higher depreciation expense as revenue related data center investments continue to come online. Moving below the line, adjusted non-operating expense is expected to be between $190 million to $195 million, driven by lower interest expense as we continue to direct free cash flows to reducing debt outstanding. Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segment. Second quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.2 billion, up 14% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of $884 million were up 20%, driven by a 40% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues, which grew 33% year-over-year. This strong energy performance included a 30% increase in our oil complex, 32% growth in global natural gas revenues and 64% growth in our environmental business. In addition, as of the end of July, open interest is up 20% year-over-year, including 21% growth in global interest rates and 25% growth in our energy markets. Shifting to recurring revenues, which include our exchange data services and our NYSE listings business, revenues totaled $362 million in the second quarter. Mid-single-digit growth in our broader exchange data services was underpinned by high-single-digit growth in futures data, in part driven by the continued expansion of our global energy and environmental network. In our listings business, SPAC delistings and the rolling off of 2021 admission fees offset a solid quarter for new listings. Through the first half and despite only half of IPOs eligible to list, the NYC has helped raise $12 billion in new proceeds, welcoming 30 new operating companies, including seven of the top ten IPOs. Absent a sharp recovery in IPOs in the second half, we would expect the listings revenues to trend around current levels through the balance of this year. Turning now to Slide 6, I'll discuss our fixed income and Data Services segment. Second quarter revenues totaled $565 million. Transaction revenues totaled $108 million. Transaction revenue growth at ICE bonds was once again driven by strong growth across both corporates and munis, particularly our institutional channel, which grew double-digits year-over-year. Record recurring revenues totaled $457 million and grew by 5% year-over-year, slightly ahead of expectations. In our Fixed Income Data and Analytics business, record second quarter revenues of $293 million increased by 6% year-over-year and was driven by growth in pricing and reference data, another quarter of double-digit growth in our index business, and higher than anticipated one-time revenue. Other Data and Network Services grew 5% in the second quarter, driven by our consolidated fees business and continued strength in our oil and gas desktop solutions, both of which are products that we have invested in organically enhancing both content and functionality. Total ASV or annual subscription value, exited the quarter up 4% year-over-year, coupled with visibility into our sales pipeline for the balance of this year and assuming flat markets, we are on track to grow total Fixed Income and Data Services recurring revenue around the middle of our mid-single-digit guidance range, an improvement from 3% growth in 2023. Please flip to Slide 7, where I'll discuss the results of our Mortgage Technology segment. ICE Mortgage Technology revenues were over $506 billion in the second quarter. Recurring revenues totaled $387 million. Relative to the first quarter, revenue from new customers coming online was offset by attrition within our data and document automation product or DDA, and was primarily related to non-encompassed customer on our legacy platform, who was not utilizing DDA's full capabilities. Despite this attrition, quarterly sales of DDA were the strongest since early 2022, including the signing of JPMorgan Chase, a current user of DBA on the origination side, to utilize the platform for their servicing business, a win that is a testament to past investments and synergies with MSP. In addition, while the majority of customers continue to renew at higher minimums, similar to the last few quarters, we also saw customers renew lower. It's important to note that lower minimums are paired with a higher transaction fee or price per closed loan and net total contract value, assuming normal market conditions continues to increase upon renewal. Transaction revenues totaled $119 million in the second quarter, while revenues related to encompass closed loans, applications and MERS registrations increased in the low single-digits on a year-over-year basis and increased well into the double-digits sequentially. Growth was somewhat offset by transaction revenues related to the aforementioned DNA attrition, as well as lower default management revenues within our servicing business. While the mortgage origination market is trending below historical levels and refinance ways can be difficult to predict, we are seeing encouraging signs that fundamentals are stabilizing. According to ICE Mortgage Technology Data, while still below pre-COVID levels, the number of homes on the market continues to grow, up nearly 40% versus this time last year. In addition, tappable home equity hit record levels at the end of June, reaching $11.5 trillion with over 30 million homeowners with at least $100,000 to draw down upon. And we estimate that the number of borrowers with an incentive to refinance at current rates is at its highest level in two years, driven by slightly lower interest rates and a building backlog of higher rate purchase loans. And so we continue to invest in product development and enhancement and we continue to expand our existing network, all which further position our platform to realize accelerating growth when market conditions normalize. In summary, we delivered a record first half. We once again delivered revenue growth, operating income growth and free cash flow growth. We continue to invest across our business to meet the needs of our customers and to position our business to continue to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our stockholders into the future. I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A, but for now I'll hand it over to Ben. Hey, Craig, I'll start that one off. This is Warren. So it's been pretty broad based across the recurring revenue base within that segment and so we've seen some improvements in the PRV [ph] business. As you know, last few years, the fixed income ecosystem has been facing a number of headwinds given the sharp rise in interest rates and so as we've seen that taper off, we've seen a reengagement from that customer base which has helped on the new sales front and we've seen some improvements there, certainly over the last couple of quarters it's helped. The other area that's been helpful as well is on the index side, where the last year or so we had faced some headwinds there, largely just due to markets and things of that nature, where we've seen that now reverse and obviously fund flows into fixed income funds as well has been a helpful component of that from a growth perspective. And then I'd also say within the Other Data Network services, within our desktop business, our fees business, which you heard us highlight, we've seen some really strong trends there as well and that's really a result of some of the investments we've made over the last number of years to get those into better positions. So we've been pretty pleased with that progress. I think we certainly did face some headwinds last year at a macro level and as you've seen those abate, you've seen improvement in the revenue trends and the ASV trends. And I think one thing that ASV doesn't necessarily always pick up or doesn't pick up, I mean, it's a good metric, it's not perfect, is that sales that we've made that have not yet implemented. And so as we mentioned last quarter, we do think on the connectivity side related to some of our data center investments, we'll see some of those sales start to implement in the third and the fourth quarter. That will be a little bit of help as well. So we're encouraged by that as we look into the back half. Yeah. So Ken, on your question around the size of some of the wins and maybe how the cadence of how those will kind of come into the run rate, so I think, look, back in the fourth quarter, we talked about revenue synergies around $30 million. I can tell you that we've continued to add to that number and made progress against that number. That's something I'll probably give more on an annual basis in terms of the actual number, but I can tell you that we have been making progress over the last couple of quarters there. Like I said back then as well, we wouldn't expect, we don't expect a material impact this year from those revenue synergies. MSP products Encompass, they can tend to take six to 18 months, if not longer, particularly for ones that are larger, which is what a lot of these wins that we've talked about are. And so it does take time to implement that technology and that's part of why you're seeing those kind of take some time to get into the run rate. And so we'll expect those to start to come in 2025 and 2026, as obviously those companies come online and that will flow into recurring revenue at that point. And then Dan, just a comment on recurring revenue. I think that starts to stabilize around here as we move through the back half. Obviously the market environment is weighed versus what we were thinking later last year when we spoke to you guys about or early this year when we spoke to you guys about what we thought the recurring revenue would look like for the year. I noted a few points in my script supporting that. We've seen some stabilization in those fundamentals and actually more directly related to us through the first half of this year, we've seen an increase in loans originated on Encompass. We've seen an increase in apps on Encompass, and that's encouraging. That's the first time we've seen a year-over-year increase since early 2021. Some early signs that things are stabilizing and I think a more stable market is going to give people a little bit more reason to start to think about the future, plan for the future, and start to invest in some of these products, like a DDA, which I said had its best quarter in two years for sales. And so look M&A like we had a few quarters ago or last quarter, cancellations like we had this quarter on the DDA side that can be tough to predict. But for instance, that is, I think, as Ben said, there's a small amount of customers that are on DDA that don't use Encompass or MSP now. So attrition like we saw this quarter in that way, kind of seems less likely to be ahead when moving forward. And also, as I said, we won't expect to see some of those revenue synergies come in until next year. So at this point, it feels like we see some stabilization and looking forward to 2025 as those start to hit."

            "name": "Benjamin Jackson",
            "content": "Thank you, Warren and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. In the more than 20 years ICE has been building its global energy platform. We have strategically positioned our energy business for the globalization of natural gas and the societal demand for a transition to clean energies. Our long-term strategic direction and the value of our diverse, deep and liquid markets contributed to record trading volumes across our energy complex in the second quarter. This was a key driver to another quarter of record energy revenues, up 33% year-over-year and growing double-digits on average over the past five years. This strong performance is a testament to our customers continued confidence in ICE as the global energy hedging venue of choice. And with open interest continuing to set records into July, up 25% year-over-year, our energy complex appears poised for continued strength. As the world evolves, market participants are constantly adjusting and weighing the price impact of an array of macroeconomic, geopolitical and regulatory forces, as well as externalities such as climate risk and the emergence of new renewable fuel sources. In essence, the price formation process is increasingly becoming more complex, and that additional complexity is driving customer demand for more precise risk management tools. It is also driving demand for customers to come to a single place to manage risk across oil, gas, power and environmentals because of the efficiency and deep liquid markets that we provide. Across natural gas, the evolution of a global market is accelerating. This acceleration is underpinned by the rise of liquefied natural gas, market based pricing and more recently, Europe's renewed openness to gas imports after the elimination of Russia as a key supplier and the emergence of North America as a leading natural gas exporter. Alongside this, as an important partner fuel, emitting about half as much carbon dioxide as coal to produce, natural gas continues to benefit from demand for cleaner fuels as countries move to reduce their carbon emissions. Additionally, the natural gas markets were historically regional oriented, each characterized by distinct pricing and supply dynamics. All these factors underpin the emergence of three key benchmarks for natural gas across North America, Europe and Asia, with these becoming increasingly interconnected. In Europe, our Title Transfer Facility contract or TTF is a central trading point for natural gas, just as Brent is the global benchmark for oil pricing. As a result, TTF is increasingly being used by global commercial participants, traders and investors, with a record number of market participants in the second quarter that has doubled since 2019. This has been accompanied by volumes and open interest increasing, with both setting new highs in the second quarter and each are growing double-digits on average over the past five years. In Asia, our Japan, Korea Marker, or JKM, reflects the spot market value of cargoes delivered into the region that represents a key demand center for LNG, underpinned by surging economic growth and increasing focus on environmental concerns. In 2023, global coal consumption reached its highest level in history driven by continued growth in Asia. While coal continues to be replaced by natural gas and other cleaner energy sources in Europe and North America, it still accounts for 47% of primary energy consumption in Asia. In absolute terms, the coal switching opportunity in Asia alone represents more energy than the total energy consumption in North America across all primary energy sources. Today, the relationship between our TTF and JKM benchmarks drives global price formation. Reflecting this dynamic, ICE's JKM volumes have shifted from being roughly 50% composed of the JKM TTF spread to closer to two thirds. This dynamic also illustrates market confidence in relying on TTF as a benchmark for global gas and LNG prices as participants draw assurance from its deep liquidity, rather than relying on the Asian marker in isolation. In North America, we began preparing for the liberalization of natural gas and its evolution beyond the Henry Hub benchmark more than a decade ago. Through close collaboration with our customers, we created ICE's electronic regional basis markets, a suite of precise risk management tools reflecting the commercially relevant supply and demand dynamics of 70 hubs across North America. These hubs are priced at a differential to Henry hub to reflect U.S. regional market conditions, transportation costs and transmission capacity between locations. Alongside this, many market participants seeking to manage exposure to U.S. natural gas price dynamics, gravitate towards ICE's Henry Hub contracts for liquidity and the linkage to our exclusive basis markets. As the global landscape of LNG exports, geopolitical forces and shifts to cleaner energy sources all continue to evolve, we see these dynamics underpinning the strong momentum for this business and we see these trends continuing to favor our growing global gas complex well into the future. The importance of the evolution of energy markets extends to our global environmental markets where the number of market participants has nearly doubled since 2019, setting an all-time high in the second quarter and increasing 18% year-over-year. At the same time, volumes increased 61% in the quarter, including growth across our regional greenhouse gas initiative allowances, California carbon allowances as well as our EU and UK allowances. This strong performance has contributed to a 43% increase in environmental revenues year-to-date, including 64% growth in the second quarter. In parallel, across our power markets, volumes increased 32% in the first half, including 51% growth in the second quarter. With AI and data center build outs expected to drive meaningful power demand into the next decade, our platform is uniquely positioned to capture this tailwind and help market participants manage this potentially volatile growth story, given that ICE is the most comprehensive platform that offers U.S. regional gas markets alongside deep and liquid power and environmental markets. In summary, for market participants seeking to manage their risk, ICE's global energy platform offers over 1000 futures and options contracts across natural gas, power, environmental and oil markets, supporting the growing complexity of energy markets and uniquely positioning us to benefit from both near-term volatility and secular growth trends occurring across these markets. Moving to our Fixed Income and Data Services business, our quality pricing and reference data, combined with over 40 years of price history, serve as the foundation for what is today one of the largest providers of fixed income indices globally. Year-to-date, revenue in our index business is up double digits, with passive ETF assets under management benchmark to our indices growing to a record $616 billion through the end of the second quarter, from less than $100 billion in 2017 and doubling since 2020. In addition, we continue to see returns on past investments made to enhance content and functionality across our other data and network services business. As an example, within our consolidated fees business, investments we've made to elevate and enhance our offering have directly contributed to the double-digit revenue growth in this area year-to-date. With content from over 600 data sources, our offering gives customers access to a broad universe of low latency financial information with full depth of market data. As firms seek more high quality data from a range of different sources in a cost efficient manner, our competitive and comprehensive offering stands to benefit. While our consolidated fees and index businesses are smaller components of our comprehensive data platform today, they're both well positioned to continue to grow and capture market share while also serving an important role in our broader enterprise sales strategy. Turning now to our mortgage business, the secular shift towards the adoption of an electronic workflow continues. With a life of loan offering that spans from point of consumer acquisition all the way through to the secondary market, our platform is uniquely positioned to play a fundamental role. In the second quarter, we closed on 29 new Encompass clients as customers focus on modernizing their infrastructure and on workflow efficiencies. Building on wins announced last quarter, such as Citizens Bank and Webster Bank, we are pleased to announce that mortgage Solutions of Colorado has signed on to Encompass expanding on the MSP win we announced late last year. We have also just signed another top 15 home builder in the U.S. to Encompass and our DDA platform, making them the 9th homebuilder of the top 15 to join our community. In addition, as mentioned last quarter, we've been integrating our tax, flood and closing fees data into Encompass, providing customers with more choice of service providers on our platform. In that regard, we're encouraged by the early traction in our cross-sell efforts across these offerings, executing on 200 data cross-sells to Encompass clients in the first half. While these offerings are small components of our business today, these wins give us confidence in our ability to execute on the synergy targets that we laid out at the time of the Black Knight transaction. Along the same lines, following the first integration of Encompass to MSP by leveraging our data and document automation platform for loan onboarding straight from origination through to servicing, we are pleased to announce that we signed JPMorgan Chase onto this service. For our traditional DDA business we also had 12 new wins to new and existing Encompass clients in the second quarter alone. In summary, we are pleased to see the value of our platform and solutions are providing by our comprehensive technology platform that it's resonating in the marketplace. With a touch point to nearly every market participant, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital solutions provide. As these new customers come onto our network, we have the opportunity to expand the customer relationship over time as they adopt additional solutions. Just as we've seen in our other markets, this flywheel effect gives us confidence that we can grow our business that today is only a fraction of the $14 billion addressable market that's in the early days of an analog to digital conversion. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Sure, Dan, this is Ben. I'll take this one. So I'll start with the second part of it on the renegotiations and Warren mentioned it in his prepared remarks as well. We continue on the Encompass side to see the majority of the clients. So the number of clients that are renewing are renewing at higher subscriptions. And when that happens, we have a lower foreclosed loan fee is typically the trade-off there, but we do have a percent that we've seen in similar the last few quarters that are choosing to renew at lower minimums, lower subscription fees. And the trade-off there is higher foreclosed loan fees. And as the market normalizes, the algorithm that we have is the total contract value going to go up and that's what we're consistently targeting and executing against. So we're seeing that trend in terms of renegotiation continue. And it's been very much in line with what we've seen in past quarters. On the attrition that Warren mentioned in his prepared remarks that was on the DDA side. So with that data and document automation platform, this is a platform that Ellie Mae acquired a number of years ago, and there are some legacy clients on that platform that don't utilize the automation capabilities that that platform has in line with Encompass or with MSP. They're using it in isolation and that's where we saw the attrition happened with one client that Warren referenced. The other opportunity that we see here though, is that we had another client that was very similarly situated to that one that we engaged with very deeply and convinced them to change their loan origination provider from where they were in the past to moving over to Encompass and couple that with the DDA platform and we were successful in doing that. And in the second quarter, that's the Citizens Bank win that I had referenced was exactly that. We renegotiated a DDA contract, brought them on to Encompass, and have a much more longer term strategic relationship with the client. Thanks, Kyle. This is Ben. So we see a number of different opportunities in this area and I'll describe a few. Some that are very near-term and I mentioned this in my script as well, is that we saw an opportunity to take a bunch of data sets that Black Knight's data business had and integrate them onto Encompass. We had that as part of our plan even before we closed as part of the integration strategy. That was one of the first things we were going to do. We executed on that. We just closed last September, got all those data sets onto Encompass for the first time. And in the first half of this year, we've had 200 cross-sells of flood data and fees, data sets that traditionally were not on Encompass to our Encompass customer base. So that's -- and there's a long runway to go on that when you think of 3000 Encompass customers and each of those data sets being cross-sell opportunities, there's a good runway ahead of us on that. The second thing that we executed on and we're very pleased with is, there's a data set within Black Knight that are AVMs, so they're valuations on homes. And with the trend right now with the amount of equity built up in homes, we've built a straight through service around home equity lines of credit that take our AVMs. So you can take the current valuation on a home, the servicer can take that information plus the data they know on the customer, present an offer for a home equity line of credit for a client and then feed that information directly into the origination platform as our Encompass platform handles home equity lines of credit seamlessly and then as those loans are originated, pass those straight through into servicing. So the AVMs are definitely a key component of that and home equity lines of credit is something that we're seeing are very popular right now. Longer term one of the things that we did strategically when we integrated these businesses, we took that Black Knight data business and we moved it into our Fixed Income and Data Services business with Chris and we just did that at the beginning of this year. The reason for that is we believe there's a lot of data sets within there, within Black Knight that traditionally have been sold to mortgage specific companies that have a lot of capital markets applicability and those are data sets like they're called McDash. There's another one called AFT, and another one EMBS. And all of them in a sense are predicting prepayments on loans or portfolio of loans or portfolios of mortgage backed securities. And obviously with our Fixed Income and Data Services business, we have a very significant business in pricing and reference data around mortgage backed securities. We have a whole community of customers with thousands of them that consume our Fixed Income and Data Services products. And that's where we're introducing the products as they are today, but also engaging with clients to get feedback on new services that we can build for more of a medium term opportunity. So those are some of the ones off the top of my head. Thanks for the question. So you've heard us over a number of different calls in a number of different years, point to the fact that the major difference that you see in the way that we've developed our energy markets, whether you're talking oil, gas and also the products like power and environmentals, we have focused on the commercial customer at the core. And that's why we've built out and not dependent on just one benchmark for the growth of our business. We've built out thousands of hedging products around the world across oil, gas, power emissions, is that our customers want to be able to hedge at the point of production or consumption, as Jeff referred to even in his prepared remarks today. And it's those customers that we've really been building open interest around our platform. And obviously as open interest builds, as liquidity builds the platform, that's when you start to get also people that are taking more of a directional view on the market start to come in as well. But the leading people are the commercials and when we talk about even the success that we've had in our natural gas markets that started with a heavy, heavy commercial base. Our sweet spot in the U.S. has been the regional basis markets. Customers utilize those. And when they're trading that as a package with Henry Hub, that's what's helped to build out our Henry Hub market, because they want to do both of those trades in the same location. The same is true with the development of TTF and now with U.S natural gas moving around the world in the form of LNG and Europe consuming more U.S. LNG than from any other source and then also that coal switching opportunity that I mentioned in my prepared remarks across Asia being the size of North America itself, all of this is pointed at the commercial market participants that started in JKM and TTF has built up open interest in those products. And then we've obviously had directional traders flow in behind that. So that's a little color on that front. And on the options front, we're pleased with our options growth across the entire portfolio. Today there are a lot of risks that people need to manage. You have geopolitical risk with multiple wars going on. You've got political risks with elections pending and what that's going to mean for energy policy. And you have financial risks around what's going to happen with interest rates and all these have an impact. And options can be a very efficient way to hedge and manage risk in those situations. Thanks, Ben. Yes, those dynamics definitely matter. When people are looking at and whether you're a power producer or a consumer, the mix of things that you need to think about in trading is not only the power, the price of power itself, but also what's producing it, whether it's coal or switching to natural gas as a much cleaner fuel. And then also the dynamic around the world of also having to put a price on carbon emissions that are also a part of that. So traders that are thinking about this, hedgers that are thinking about their exposure in the energy markets have to think about all four of those dynamics. And we for many years have thought from engaging with our clients that that's the mix of risks that need to be managed. And that's why we've built out a business that includes all of those aspects to enable traders to hedge and manage that risk in one platform. And I'll even use the U.S. as a good example. I mean, if you look at the U.S., there has been a shift towards cleaner sources in gas. It's clear if you talk to any of the analysts out there that power consumption is going to continue to grow in the U.S. And one of the underlying reasons for that is data center demand. It's analysts' estimates that U.S. power is expected to increase. Power demand is going to increase over the next decade. And data center demand alone associated to that is likely 19 gigawatts last year to growing to up to 35 gigawatts by the end of this decade. And then underneath that you have natural gas demand that's linked to power generation. That today is around 35 billion cubic feet is expected from analysts estimates to grow to 45 billion cubic feet by the end of this decade. And then obviously you have markets like our environmental markets that continue to do well. Like our Reggie markets and our California carbon emissions. So I think that's a good story to tell because we see that story developing in Europe. We see that story developing in Asia and the mix of having U.S. basis markets, power, Henry and environmental markets all in one place and enabling customers to hedge and manage this risk in an efficient basis is what enables us to do this and provide those services to clients. And then Alex, just to give you on Flagstar our total ICE mortgage technology revenues. Hi Alex, it's Ben. Thanks for the question. What we always look at is the health of open interest across our markets as the barometer and really the predictor for future volumes and future volume potential for our markets. And if you look across our marketplace now, overall across all of our futures business, open interest versus last year is up 20%. In energy it's up 25%. So to us those are great indicators that we're doing the right things, partnering with our customers, developing out all of these very new innovations and new products and more precision in the way that customers can manage and hedge their risk around the world. The development of new products in oil have been really exciting for us with what we've innovated with our HOU contract, pricing Midland WTI basis, Houston, which is now flowing into dated Brent. And that market is growing phenomenally for us up 400% in open interest. You look at the development of our Murban contract that we innovated three years ago, pricing Middle Eastern crude going to Asia, ADVs in that contract are up 160%. All of our swaps to futures markets, these are all refined products and base markets continue to grow really nice for us in oil. In natural gas we continue to innovate and continue to introduce new contracts, new LNG contracts. We've talked about the development of JKM, the development of our TTF contract. All of these in our minds create a flywheel effect because anybody that's trading in these energy markets wants to put a price on oil, power, gas emissions, and it's so much more efficient for them to do that all in one place. So I'd point to the innovation that we've had. The open interest growth there has also fed into the growth of our benchmark contracts as well."

            "name": "Jeffrey Sprecher",
            "content": "Thank you, Ben. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 9. At ICE, our mission for more than 20 years has been to drive transparency and create workflow efficiencies for our customers. We do this by building and operating mission critical digital networks that leverage our technology, data and operating expertise. At the time of our IPO on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005, we were purely an energy exchange offering only a handful of products to a narrow customer base. Since then, our focus has been building a global platform that has the asset class breadth to enable us to pursue growth opportunities quickly and efficiently as they emerge around the world and deliver all weather results. While we're known for some of our larger scale acquisitions, we have also completed a wide range of smaller bolt-on transactions. We reimagine these businesses by leveraging technology and crafting significant product development to drive organic growth, further bolstering the content on our networks and accelerating our broadening into new asset classes. Operating marketplaces with strong network effects is a core expertise at ICE, and today we do so across an array of asset classes, geographies and customer types. Optimizing the operation of financial services databases helps drive market transparency and this transparency attracts additional participant, which in turn improves market liquidity. It's a virtuous cycle that continuously expands the network while strengthening the market. Starting with our commodities business in 2001, we acquired the International Petroleum Exchange, which brought us both proprietary content in the form of the Brent Crude Index, as well as connectivity to a broad network of energy traders and commercial customers. Building on that foundation, we organically developed and grew hundreds of precise hedging instruments to serve the evolving needs of this commercial customer base. Today, the original Brent crude contract trades alongside our Midland WTI, Cushing WTI, Platts Dubai and Middle East Murban grades of crude to additionally support over 800 related commodity products developed by ICE, giving participants the ability to manage the price of energy at the point of consumption or production around the world. Thanks, Ken. I'll start and then Warren will pick up on the second part of that question. So we're very pleased with the expansion of the relationship with JPMorgan Chase. Obviously, they're been a longtime MSP client. They've added Encompass across all channels and have added DDA for the origination side and now are leveraging DDA as that integration point to automatically onboard loans from Encompass into MSP. So that's a great win for us and it's really in line with the vision of why we put together all these assets is to provide the efficiency that these platforms provide for institutions. And in terms of the funnel behind that, we continue, as you've seen each quarter, announcing new wins. And whether it's MSP wins for clients that have historically been on Encompass, and we've had a great relationship with or the other way around, clients that have been on MSP that are signing on to Encompass, we're very pleased with the success that we've had out of the gate, and we continue to see that funnel building and it's building in a couple of different ways. It's building from clients that realize they don't need to have their own in-house bespoke systems. That's oftentimes what we're replacing in particular on the very large institutional side for this. And really the secret sauce should be how do they cross-sell to their clients and understand more about that overall relationship across the institutional enterprise that those banks have with the clients, as opposed to coming up with some unique way to run a loan origination system or a servicing system. So that funnel continues to build. We feel good about that on both sides, on both MSP and Encompass, and with a number of the wins that we've had and that you've even referenced in your question, we have a lot of those going through implementations, and as you can appreciate, we have a large backlog of those implementations. They're going very well. They just take time. They're very complex. There's a lot of compliance aspects in and around mortgage in fact in most areas that these banks work. Mortgage is probably one of the most heavily compliance -- areas of compliance they have to comply with. So those implementations take time. And I'll hand the second part of it off to Warren. Well, thank you, Drew, for managing the call. And I want to thank you all for joining us this morning. And we look forward to updating you again very soon as we continue to innovate for our customers and build our all-weather business model to continue to drive growth. With that, I hope you'll have a great day."

        "content": "Operator: Hello, everyone, and welcome to the ICE's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call and Webcast. My name is Emily, and I'll be facilitating your call today. [Operator Instructions]  \n I will now hand over to Katia Gonzalez, Manager of ICE's Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nKatia Gonzalez: Good morning. ICE's first quarter 2024 earnings release and presentation can be found in the Investors section of ice.com. These items will be archived and our call will be available for replay. \n Today's call may contain forward-looking statements. These statements, which we undertake no obligation to update, represent our current judgment and are subject to risks, assumptions and uncertainties. For a description of the risks that could cause our results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, please refer to our 2023 Form 10-K, 2024 first quarter Form 10-Q and other filings with the SEC. \n In our earnings supplement, we refer to certain non-GAAP measures. We believe our non-GAAP measures are more reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. You'll find a reconciliation to the prevailing GAAP terms in our earnings materials. When used on this call, net revenue refers to revenue net of transaction-based expenses and adjusted earnings refers to adjusted diluted earnings per share.  \n Throughout this presentation, unless otherwise indicated, references to revenue growth are on a constant currency basis. Please see the explanatory notes on the second page of the earnings supplement for additional details regarding the definition of certain items. \n With us on the call today are Jeff Sprecher, Chair and CEO; Warren Gardiner, Chief Financial Officer; Ben Jackson, President; Lynn Martin, President of the NYSE; and Chris Edmonds, President of Fixed Income & Data Services.  \n I'll now turn the call over to Warren. \nWarren Gardiner: Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our strong first quarter results.  \n First quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.3 billion. and pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight, increased by 5% versus last year. First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $930 million, at the low end of our guidance range, driven by an acceleration of planned expense synergies and a few onetime benefits within compensation costs.  \n Moving to the balance of the year. We expect second quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $945 million to $955 million, with a sequential increase driven in part by a full quarter of merit increases across the organization, planned investments and the modernization of MSP and higher D&A as recent revenue-related data center investments go live.  \n In addition and in part due to synergies being realized sooner than previously expected, we are lowering our full year expense guidance to $3.79 billion to $3.82 billion. \n This strong first quarter performance helped to drive record adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year on a pro forma basis and a record earnings per share of $1.48. First quarter free cash flow totaled $877 million, enabling us to reduce debt outstanding by roughly $600 million in the first quarter. Since we completed our acquisition of Black Knight in September,  we've reduced debt by roughly $2 billion. And as a result, adjusted leverage ended the first quarter approximately 3.9x pro forma EBITDA, with first quarter interest expense down $10 million from the fourth quarter.  \n Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segments. First quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of $866 million were up 16%, in part driven by a 12% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues, which grew 32% year-over-year. This strong performance included a 28% increase in our oil complex, 42% growth in global natural gas revenues driven by another record-setting quarter for TTF, and 26% growth in our environmental business. In addition, as of the end of April, open interest is up 23% year-over-year, including 22% growth in our global commodities and 25% growth in our energy markets.  \n Shifting to recurring revenues, which include our Exchange data services and our NYC Listings business, revenue totaled $357 million in the first quarter. Similar to last quarter, growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data was partially offset by the rolling off of initial listing fees related to the strong IPO market in 2021 and lower exchange data revenue at the NYSE. It's worth noting that the IPO market has shown signs of improvement so far in 2024, with the NYSE capturing nearly 70% of total proceeds raised and welcoming 6 of the top 7 IPOs year-to-date, despite more than 50% of new listings not meeting our gold standard of qualification criteria.  \n Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income & Data Services segment. First quarter revenues totaled a record $568 million. Transaction revenues of $119 million were driven by growth in corporate bond trading, which was in part driven by strong growth within our institutional channel. This is offset by lower treasury and CD volumes as well as lower levels of CDS clearing activity. Record recurring revenues totaled $449 million and grew by 4% year-over-year. In our fixed income and data analytics business, record first quarter revenues of $288 million increased by 4%. \n Growth was once again driven by improving trends in our PRD business and another quarter of double-digit growth in our index business. Importantly, fixed income data and analytics ASV, or annual subscription value, improved from the 2% range experienced through much of 2023 to 4% exiting the first quarter as we continue to see customer reengagement and investment across the fixed income ecosystem.  \n Other Data & Network Services grew 4% in the first quarter, driven by our feeds business and continued strength in our oil and gas desktop solutions, both of which grew double digits year-over-year. Importantly, demand for our connectivity solutions remains strong with the backlog of signatures related to our ICE Global Network offering expected to come online and into both ASV and revenue in early July following the build-out of additional data center capacity. As a result, we expect second quarter year-over-year growth in overall recurring revenue to be similar to the first quarter, with year-over-year growth improving in the second half, driven by continued strong trends across fixed income data and analytics, and an acceleration in growth in our other data and network services businesses.  \n Please flip to Slide 7, where I will discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments are on a pro forma basis. ICE Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $499 million in the first quarter. Recurring revenues totaled $390 billion (sic) [$390 million]. As we noted last quarter, recurring revenues were impacted by both industry consolidation and continued pressure on renewals within our origination technology business. It's worth noting that while current macro conditions are putting pressure on minimums at renewal, and thus, our recurring revenues, customers are overwhelmingly remaining on our platform.  \n And while yet to manifest in our results, lower minimums upon renewal are paired with a higher price per transaction, a dynamic that will provide an incremental tailwind when industry volumes normalize. Said differently, total contract value in a normal market is on average increasing upon renewal. \n Transaction revenues totaled $109 million in the first quarter. While closed loans increased slightly, this was offset by lower professional services fees and lower default management revenues within our servicing business. Importantly, as I previously indicated, we have realized expense synergies faster than originally anticipated, which, when coupled with a relatively stable top line on a year-over-year basis, has helped to drive an 8% increase in segment operating income.  \n Looking to the full year and after factoring in the dramatic shift in interest rate expectations for 2024 relative to just 3 months ago, we now expect total revenue growth in our Mortgage Technology business to be flat to down in the low single-digit range, with revenues unlikely to improve materially from the first quarter levels until the second half. The high end of the range is underpinned by a flat-to-modest improvement in industry origination volumes or the lower end of the range anticipates a more conservative decline in the mid- to high single-digit range relative to 2023.  \n Despite these macro pressures, we continue to invest in product development and enhancement. We continue to expand our existing network and we are executing on our synergy targets, all of which further position our platform to realize accelerating growth when market conditions normalize.  \n In summary, we delivered another very strong start to the year. We once again delivered strong revenue, operating income, free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share growth. And we continue to invest across our business to meet both the needs of our customers and to position our business to continue to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our stockholders into the future.  \n I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben. \nBenjamin Jackson: Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Our customers continue to rely on our leading technology, mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to navigate uncertainty while managing risk. Across our global Futures and Options business, total average daily volumes increased 16% to a record 8.1 million lots in the first quarter, including records across commodities, energy and total options. This strong performance drove record futures and options revenues, with energy revenues nearly tripling since the same period in 2010 and growing double digits on average over that time frame. And through April, open interest across our global commodities and energy markets remains at all-time highs, up 22% and 25%, respectively, versus last year. A direct benefit from the long tail of secular growth trends unfolding across global oil, natural gas and environmental markets.  \n A number of years ago, we recognized the importance of investing in an energy platform that is truly global, one that better serves the needs of an evolving and growing commercial customer base. Today, as a result of organic and inorganic investments, trading on our network is not tied to any single product or limited to any one region. Instead, we have built a diversified energy network, delivering comprehensive risk management solutions, providing capital efficiencies and positioned to grow alongside the continued evolution of global markets. \n In our oil markets, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers seek not only liquidity in the global -- major global benchmarks, but also in products that provide for greater hedging precision. Reflecting this dynamic, our other crude and refined products continue to set records with ADV growing double digits on average over the past 5 years. This portfolio increased 47% year-over-year in the first quarter alone, while open interest is up 27% through the end of April.  \n In the more than 20 years that ICE has been building its global energy platform, we have created hundreds of precise hedging instruments, driven by collaboration with our customers. All of these instruments are underpinned by the deep liquidity in our benchmarks such as Brent. In March 2021, in partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and 9 of the world's largest energy traders as founding partners, we launched ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, or IFAD. This new exchange enabled for the first time, market participants to come together and contribute to the price formation of a new innovation, the Murban Futures contract, an important benchmark for oil flowing to Asia.  \n In the first quarter, as IFAD marked its third anniversary, our Murban Futures reached new highs, surpassing over 1 million contracts traded along with a series of open interest records in April. Similarly, our Platts Dubai contract had another quarter of record volumes, increasing 58% year-over-year. \n Another innovation that we launched 2 years ago, the Midland WTI contract known as HOU, is a deliverable crude grade of Midland oil based in Houston. This contract is fast becoming the most accurate representation of the Houston oil market as evidenced by HOU reaching record volumes during the quarter. Further supporting the growth of this new risk management innovation is that this oil has been added into the ICE Brent basket, which creates new opportunities for clients to manage risk by hedging with this contract. Collectively, this strong performance drove another quarter of record oil revenues, up 28% year-over-year.  \n In our natural gas markets, the globalization of gas and the rise of LNG are secular trends we began investing in over a decade ago, beginning with our index investment, an investment that has established us as a leader in European gas trading. Today, with Asia as the largest buyer of global LNG, the relationship between our European TTF and Asian JKM benchmarks drives global price formation. In the first quarter, the number of market participants in each market grew double digits versus last year, with both reaching record volumes.  \n This strong performance drove record natural gas revenues, up 42% year-over-year in the first quarter. Importantly, open interest trends for TTF and JKM remained strong through April, up 90% and 50% year-over-year, respectively. The globalization of natural gas alongside a global focus on decarbonization is critical to environmental markets, built off of our acquisition of the Climate Exchange more than a decade ago, we operate the world's largest and most liquid environmental markets. Here, we have seen the number of active market participants grow double digits on average over the past 5 years, including record participation in the first quarter.  \n At the same time, ADV across our environmental portfolio increased 22% year-over-year, with open interest up 27% through the end of April. Price transparency across the energy spectrum is critical as companies look to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner. By combining the network and liquidity of our global energy platform with our leading environmental portfolio, we are well positioned to help our customers navigate this transition across global energy markets.  \n In summary, the evolution of our energy markets is one example of how we continuously invest and develop customer-driven solutions across asset classes, as well as the creative approach we've taken to leverage our infrastructure, technology and expertise to drive value creation. Our record performance is a product of these investments, some that we've made more than a decade ago, and our commitment to staying close to our customers, an approach that permeates this organization, helping to drive effective and efficient product innovation.  \n This approach is also important to our data business, where we are uniquely positioned to leverage our distribution and our infrastructure to create new content and to expand the breadth of our offering. Our position as a leading provider of price and reference data have served as the foundation for what is today one of the largest providers of fixed income indices globally. The accelerating growth of passive investing and the efforts we've made to increase the breadth of our offering, and the flexibility of our approach to index construction, has contributed to the double-digit average annual growth in our index business since we acquired the Bank of America Merrill Lynch franchise in 2017.  \n A key driver of this growth is the increase in the passive ETF assets under management benchmarked to our indices, growing to a record of $593 billion through the end of the first quarter from less than $100 billion in 2017. \n While critical, our pricing data and index businesses are only components of what we offer to this growing industry. As a leading provider of such proprietary data services, we have developed deep expertise in gathering and cleansing unstructured data, skills in building the database that serves as the foundation for developing actionable insights and identifying opportunities not only in the fixed income markets, but across many other asset classes.  \n This is an expertise we're starting to leverage across a number of mortgage data initiatives. For example, in April, we announced the integration of our property and loan-level mortgage data sets with our property-level climate risk metrics covering more than 100 million U.S. homes. This integration improves transparency and facilitates risk management throughout the housing finance and property insurance sector, allowing customers to apply ICE's climate metrics to individual loans, properties and entire portfolios, improving the visibility to the inherent climate risks in each.  \n In addition, we are leveraging these insights to enhance asset-level climate risk modeling for existing municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities products. As we move forward, there is significant opportunity to continue to expand and evolve the products and services within our Fixed Income & Data Services business.  \n Turning now to our mortgage business. Following the proven playbook we've applied across our global energy and fixed income businesses, in mortgages, we are leveraging market-leading technology, mission-critical data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that improve workflow efficiencies. With a touch point to nearly every market participant, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital solutions provide.  \n In this regard, we're pleased to share that we closed 20 new Encompass clients in the first quarter. Building on the wins we announced last year with banks such as M&T and JPMorgan Chase and the announcement earlier this year of adding Fifth Third Bank to Encompass on top of their move to MSP announced late last year, we are pleased to now announce that Citizens Bank and Webster Bank, both existing MSP clients, are moving to Encompass. Just like many of the other recent wins that we are implementing, these clients see the significant value that we can provide through our complete front-to-back offering.  \n For MSP, building on the capital mortgage solutions of Texas and CapEd Credit Union wins mentioned on the last call, we closed Lennar, a long-time Encompass client. \n Our growing customer relationships serve as a validation of our vision, bringing together a complete front-to-back experience for our customers and their clients through one trusted platform. Our clients seek a solution provider that supports digital workflows throughout the home-ownership life cycle, starting with matching a consumer to the right lending product at the right time on the loan origination, closing, servicing in the capital markets. This is directly in line with our long-term vision and the journey we have been on.  \n Importantly, we remain focused on executing on our strategy of relieving the pain points and inefficiencies that exist across the mortgage workflow, and remain committed to investing behind secular growth while enhancing the value proposition of our network. For example, we have completed the evolution of Encompass to a new web user experience, with new automation tools and more ways to partner and extend the platform to serve our customers' business needs. In parallel, we're executing on our investment commitments to continue to advance our market-leading MSP servicing platform. \n A perfect example of this execution is the recently announced rollout of our MSP Digital Experience, or MSP DX. This service is an intuitive and conversational new interface, leveraging natural language processing for our servicing system designed to streamline workflows, increase efficiencies and expedite training of new servicing personnel. Along the same lines, we've completed our first integration of Encompass to MSP. \n This integration leverages our data and document automation platform, and our neural network large language model for the classification and extraction of data from documents to automate loan onboarding from Encompass straight to MSP, reducing errors and providing significant efficiencies to clients that have our front-to-back solution set. Simultaneously, we've been integrating our tax, flood and closing fees into Encompass, providing lenders more choice in service providers for these important underwriting data assets. \n In summary, as we move through 2024 and beyond, we are excited about the many opportunities for growth that lie ahead. Opportunities that we're able to capture because of the investments we've made in the past and the strategic investments we will continue to make across our networks into the future. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. \nJeffrey Sprecher: Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 9. We are increasingly being asked how ICE is incorporating artificial intelligence into our business. So while I'm not here to discuss the financial impact, I thought I'd touch on some of the AI investments across ICE. \n Like many large corporations, we have developers working on how to integrate AI models into our products, on how we better contract for and monetize our proprietary data sets and on how we improve our own productivity. Along those lines, we created an internal R&D group that we're calling our AI Center of Excellence, where we're testing novel use cases and working to build appropriate governance card guardrails to reduce or eliminate the risks inherent to AI. We are focused on getting it right, while working towards a goal of bringing AI-enabled enhancements and new products to our customers. \n Ben just spoke about investing in our mortgage data and document automation product, which is an extension of the product formerly called AIQ that we acquired with Ellie Mae. We've also mentioned investing in our commodity chat platform called, ICE Chat, to improve upon actionable insights and market data. And we've commented on our work using artificial intelligence models for pattern recognition in our regulatory compliance activities. Today, I'd like to further speak to some of the lesser-known, second-order impacts of the market's current energetic focus on AI that we see feeding growth to ICE. \n If you think back to the start of ICE, the prevalent financial exchanges were largely open outcry venues, and both listed and over-the-counter trading involve significant involvement of human intermediaries. Our thesis of using digital networks to connect people and broaden access to risk management pushed us to create and manage our own data centers and network channels. Today, we operate from 14 global data centers, and we've built out the ICE Cloud, a managed network, connecting our data centers to many third-party trading and data venues, and interconnecting major players across the global financial services industry. \n We've made the determination that managing our own IT infrastructure and making it available to our customers directly and through an ICE-managed cloud offers us a competitive advantage while providing for better intellectual property protection and creating an avenue for our connectivity and data revenue growth. One service that we offer our customers is the ability to utilize their code and equipment within the ICE global network and transmit the digital output across the ICE-managed cloud. This ICE strategy has resulted in requests from customers to incorporate their AI models inside our network, and it's driving increasing demand for ICE Data Center and ICE Cloud access. \n We've already received customer deposits for much of our planned year 2025 and year 2026 network build-outs, and we've been working with our vendors to plan for its continued expansion. This customer interest in artificial intelligence modeling should provide a multiyear tailwind to revenue growth in our data and connectivity business. Another second-order revenue impact from the current interest in AI is the attention that our listed emissions offset markets and our listed renewable energy markets are receiving from power companies and third-party data center developers as they plan for their future growth, given that ICE is a major host of the world's tradable emission and renewable energy markets. \n Our subsidiary, ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers regulated benchmarks, manages our carbon market data service that provides validated data to companies seeking information about the voluntary markets for carbon credits. Interest in these markets is surging as evidenced by corporate involvement more than doubling over the past 6 months to more than 250 firms. And last month, the United Nations Science-based Target Initiative, the world's main verifier of emissions targets, said that it will permit the use of emission offset credits to count towards reducing emissions against Scope 3 targets. \n Coupled with the European Commission's aim to increase its emissions reductions beginning in 2024, plus the EU's inclusion of new industrial sectors that will be subject to these targets, we believe the backdrop for revenue growth in ICE's environmental and renewable markets attributable to AI model demand remains bright. \n Shifting now to our strong results. In the first quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share, yet again delivering the best quarter in our company's history. Our consistent results are a testament to the value of our mission-critical data, leading market technology and the strength of our strategic business model. ICE is a company that has deliberately grown through curated acquisition and entrepreneurship. We have targeted an interrelated collection of markets to help our customers manage risk due to both acts of nature and acts of man. \n Typically, we think of our global commodity-oriented businesses is being levered to acts of nature, such as issues that affect supply chain flows. And we think of our global financially oriented risk management businesses as being levered to acts of man, such as Central Bank and cross-border trade policies. We purposely have targeted providing a mix of these businesses to find growth somewhere in the world in varying underlying conditions. And we have intentionally positioned our company to provide customer solutions to facilitate all-weather results, such as those we are reporting for this record quarter. \n I'd like to end my prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to our best-ever quarterly results. \n And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Emily, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Ken Worthington with JPMorgan. \nKenneth Worthington: I wanted to dig a bit more into the globalization of gas. So a couple of questions here. OI is surging in TTF. Volume growth remains very strong. How far along is this period of rapid growth for TTF? And is it really being driven by the globalization of gas? Or is there something else driving this most recent surge? And then can you address the extent to which the Biden administration pause of LNG export licenses could impact the globalization of gas? It feels like a speed bump along the way, but does a Republican president change the equation? \nBenjamin Jackson: Ken, it's Ben. Thanks for the question. And I'll take the first part of your question first, and then I'll hit the second part. In terms of natural gas, we believe that TTF is a long, long runway to go. And what really fundamentally changed is that natural gas has been liberalized. It's no longer wedded to just pipeline flows, and it can now move freely around the world in the form of LNG. And there have been massive investments in LNG terminals and regasification terminals around the world that have really changed and evolved gas into a global commodity, and TTF has emerged as the global way to hedge that risk. \n And if you look at all the risks around the world right now and across Europe and the U.S., we believe that you need to have not only benchmark products, but you also have to have products that enable people to manage risk at more precise hedging locations as well in parallel to products like TTF. I mean, right now, you look at the dynamics, the European gas markets have recovered to some degree, with U.S. LNG now flowing into Europe. You've got regasification terminals that have come online in Germany and the Netherlands that have helped. Storage has been at high levels this past winter. We had a mild winter in Europe. But you still have a backdrop of geopolitical risks that introduced tail risk and ongoing risk to energy supply that are going to continue to evolve supply chains around the natural gas market. \n And now that gas can move freely, we think there's going to be a tremendous amount of opportunities for clients to use our products to hedge all of those risks, the confluence of those risks and as those things change and evolve. And as you pointed out, TTF has had a tremendous runway here. Our open interest is up 90% year-over-year and volumes are up 60%. \n In terms of the White House pausing on new permits for LNG exporters from the U.S., we see this as just another speed bump, you used the right word, along the way, that market participants have to look at and determine what risk does this introduce to me. It takes years for this to have an impact. Permits that are in place now, take years to come online. So it's more of a longer-term implication for the market to absorb. But on the same token, you have a new LNG terminal coming online in Canada soon. So you're going to continue to see LNG as it's been liberalized move around the world. That risk needs to be managed, and TTF is the fundamental place that it's done. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Benjamin Budish with Barclays. \nBenjamin Budish: I was wondering if you could touch on the IMT revised guidance. To what extent is your view on the transaction-based opportunity dependent on -- or based on changes in the MBA forecast? Or Warren, I think you mentioned the change in the interest rate outlook over the course of the year. How much is that -- are those two pieces sort of impacting what that business could look like the supply and demand for house versus interest rates making the environment less affordable? \n And then on the recurring revenue side, it sounds like negotiations are a little bit tougher in terms of minimum contract levels. Any commentary on the overall health of the customer base? It sounds like churn is quite low, but any other color there would be helpful. \nWarren Gardiner: Sure, Ben. Let me start on that transaction. I'm going to turn it to Ben to give you some color more on what's going on with the customer front. So yes, you're correct. I mean when we thought about guidance last quarter and we gave you that guidance, the high end of that range really was taking in what some of the forecasters were giving you in terms of what they thought the year was going to look like. And we wanted to build in towards the lower end of that range, a little bit more of a conservative outlook.\n You've seen that they brought those down as well, and that actually now -- so that same framework was how we were thinking about this as we revised guidance this quarter because we've now taken it down sort of similar -- at least at the high end towards where they're sitting at the moment and that we wanted to put a little bit more of a conservative bent on it towards the lower end of that range as we move forward. There's obviously a lot of uncertainty around what the trajectory of interest rates and, therefore, mortgage bonds are going to look like as we move through the balance of the year. And so that was how we were thinking about it from an origination standpoint and just the macro impact that, that has on the customer base as they think about making decisions and things of that nature. \nBenjamin Jackson: Ben, I'll follow up on the second part of your question there. We have 100% conviction on the ability for this business to grow over the long term. And we continued quarter-over-quarter to just give more and more evidence to the fact with just customer wins that are coming on board. So we feel great that even in this volume environment, that is an environment that hasn't been seen almost in a generation since 1991, that we're continuing to bring customers onto our platform into our ecosystem and continuing to gain in that area.\n A couple of things. Obviously, in this past quarter, the industry shifted from a rate cut expectation of 5 to 6 cuts in 2024 to what seems like now is 1, maybe 2, and this happened rapidly. So we're watching and monitoring what's happening with our clients as a result of that. The couple of things I'd point out. Customers are renewing and renewing at very high levels. \n On the renewal front, we're seeing almost a repeat of what we've seen and what I've talked about in several quarters now that the majority of our customers are renewing and they're renewing at higher minimums, higher subscription levels. But we are seeing some percentage of those customers that are choosing to renew with lower minimums, lower subscriptions. But the trade-off there is consistently a higher foreclosed loan fee. And our objective on all of these renewals, which we're achieving, is to increase the total contract value that these customers are, regardless of which way that go in that negotiation based on the value that we're continuing to provide with all the new innovation that we're introducing into the marketplace. \n So in terms of renewals, we're not really seeing a significant change. On the sales front, we continue to have great sales success. I just mentioned several new wins on top of other wins that we've announced recently with Citizens Bank and Webster Bank. So we feel good about the funnel. What's unknown and what we're just watching closely is that just given how fast rate expectations changed, a lot of our market participants want market stability and want a view as to when they're going to get return on investments. So we're watching closely to see our sales cycles going to potentially lengthen. But for the most part, we are seeing customers continuing to take this time while the tide is out to invest in this critical infrastructure, so that when the tide comes back in, they're well-positioned to capitalize on them. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Patrick Moley with Piper Sandler. \nPatrick Moley: I was hoping that you could just provide an overview or a progress update on your efforts to build out institutional connectivity in the Fixed Income & Data Services business. And then secondly, can you help us understand the institutional opportunity there and your strategy just from an inorganic and organic standpoint? \nLynn Martin: This is Lynn Martin. Thanks so much for the question. So we are incredibly excited at the opportunity to continue to build out the institutional connectivity across our Fixed Income & Data Services segment. Now part of the reason why we're so excited is because we have seen the adoption on the institutional side in our muni execution business, in particular, continued to grow with a CAGR over the last 2 years. And because of the way we have deliberately curated our data assets, we think there is still room to continue to grow given the success we've had with institutional adoption, particularly in our index business. \n Our index business, as Ben mentioned earlier in his prepared remarks, is now at a record roughly $600 billion in AUM that benchmarks against our index business. Going to turn it to my colleague, Chris, to give you some more color on the progress he's made since he stepped into the role. \nChristopher Edmonds: Yes. Thanks, Lynn. And Patrick, thanks for the question. What I've seen from being in the role since January 1, is this opportunity on the execution side for us to draw closer what we're seeing in the development of SMA or separate managed accounts to the institutional trading that's going on there. There's a deep desire across the street that get closer to those 2 pools of liquidity, and we're uniquely positioned to provide that opportunity. And as Lynn mentioned, bringing the data, so everyone is looking at exactly the same marks and valuations for those transaction values has been an important way for us to step up to the plate and provide that solution that is unique across the street and available to us and our clients. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Dan Fannon with Jefferies. \nDaniel Fannon: I wanted to follow up on mortgage. You guys obviously are having a lot of success in signing up large financial institutions over the last several quarters. How do we think about the on-ramp and the revenue contribution of some of these larger firms? And is -- and also separately on the servicing side, there was some declines both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. And I wanted to understand why the recurring portion of some of that business that's legacy Black Knight is also under a bit of pressure. \nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Dan. It's Ben. In terms of these large clients that we've signed, it does take time to implement them. These systems are core to their operations. There's a high amount of compliance that's managed through these applications. So it takes time to bed them down in highly regulated companies. So it is going to take time for those to flow through. But many of them, as they -- as we've been announcing a lot of these wins through last year, is going to start playing out towards the latter part of this year. And into next year, you'll start seeing contribution of those. \n On the servicing side, the servicing business is doing very well. From our perspective, we -- and we mentioned it on last call, there has been some industry consolidation that did impact a little bit in Q1. You do have MSRs, mortgage servicing rights, that do switch at times between subservicers, some that are on MSP and some that are not on MSP. And we saw some of that again in Q1, but the net effect is it basically nets out. \n One change we did see was -- in this past quarter was we did see an acceleration from one of the large depositories that's been very public about wanting to sell some of what they saw as their nonstrategic MSRs that came through their correspondent channel. So we saw an acceleration of that. We see that as a temporary thing. But overall, on MSP, we have a record number of clients that are on MSP with 94 clients, and we have 13 clients that are going through implementation. Many of these are ones that we've announced since we closed on Black Knight and have they really accelerated the ability to pick up a lot of these clients. \n The second thing I'd point out is that on the servicing side, I'm really pleased with our execution in terms of modernizing that technology stack. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the new natural language processing-based platform and MSP DX, so the whole interface that the clients use to interface that with the servicing system has been overhauled already. As I mentioned on our prior call, we've embedded the Simplifile platform into the back end of MSP to automate the process of releasing liens, so really unique position we are in to automate that with the platform that we have in Simplifile. \n We've -- as mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've integrated Encompass to MSP, leveraging our data and document automation platform. And the last thing I'd point out is a lot of these Encompass wins that I keep mentioning are clients that are on MSP. Webster and Citizens Bank are 2 perfect examples, where they're on MSP and the clients see the efficiency and the vision -- the efficiency that we provide and the vision of where we're going is really helping us pull through Encompass wins. So we feel great about the positioning of it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Chris Allen with Citi. \nChristopher Allen: I wanted to dig in a little bit more on the Fixed Income business. I believe you noted in the prepared remarks investments by clients in the business. So maybe some color there. And I believe you -- with the new leadership in the business, you were taking efforts to kind of reinvigorate the sales process. Just wondering where you are with that. Do you think you're fully up to speed and have improved the kind of the sales and retention focus that you've spoken to before? \nChristopher Edmonds: It's Chris. I -- what I would say, I've seen since taking on the role is two really things, one macro and one, I think, related to us. Certainly, there's a focus on the client base to find the most comprehensive solution set that's available, and they're looking for opportunities around there to tie that into single or very few vendors to provide that. And we also made a change in how we have service to clients since January. And so we moved to a different structure within the team itself, and I'm very proud of the team and the results they produced from that because they're much closer to the client these days. \n And those two things come together, we've seen a shortened sales cycle on some of the products that we have historically had great success with. We've also seen a much more robust discussion on future strategic plans on the client base. So I think we're well positioned going into the rest of the year to bring that to bear. \nLynn Martin: And then just to follow that up, this is Lynn. On the macro side, we've seen a reengagement on the fixed income fund side of the business with the amount of fixed income funds having increased by about 7% versus the prior year, which again, makes us incredibly well positioned given the suite of assets that we have, both on the end of day pricing, the reference data, the years of history there, plus on the more modern tools that we have rolled out to the market, like CEP, where we see continued strong adoption and continued strong demand. And then obviously, the fixed income index business that I referenced earlier in my comments. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Craig Siegenthaler with Bank of America. \nCraig Siegenthaler: Our question is on the acceleration in ASV in the fixed income business. We're curious which channels are driving upside to wins? Has there been any noticeable changes in attrition? And how will this translate into future revenue growth? \nWarren Gardiner: Craig, it's Warren. So I think Chris and Lynn just covered kind of what we were seeing on the customer front, and that's a big part of why you're seeing that pickup in ASV in the Fixed Income & Data and Analytics business. So -- and so we've seen pretty stable retention trends. We're seeing an improvement in the sales cycle. We're seeing, as I said in my prepared remarks, more of a reengagement from the customer base within the fixed income ecosystem around those products, whether it's the pricing and reference data business or the index business. And that's really a big reason of why we're seeing the improvement there. \n And it's really -- as we spoke to you guys throughout the course of last year, we were having some pressures on that business. We mentioned that it was because we had a really sharp move on higher in interest rates. There was sort of a period of time there where customers were sitting on their hands trying to -- sort of licking their wounds, if you will, in a way. And now that we've seen somewhat of a stabilization here at these kinds of interest rates, fixed income becomes a fairly attractive asset class. And I think that's a lot of the reason you're seeing that reengagement, you're seeing some growth, you're seeing index purchases, things of that nature, that's really starting to help that business pick up versus where it was a couple of quarters ago. \nOperator: The next question comes from Kyle Voigt with KBW. \nKyle Voigt: Maybe just on the Exchange segment. I think the recurring revenues there were flat, and I think only 1% growth on the data and connectivity side. I guess are you still expecting low single-digit growth in recurring fees for the full year in that segment. And then if so, is that dependent on the IPO environment opening up further? Or would you expect some acceleration in the data and connectivity line into the back half of the year and that could still drive full-year growth into that low single-digit range? \nWarren Gardiner: It's Warren. So yes, we still expect that to be in the low single-digit range. Really, what happened this quarter, I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks with more on the New York Stock Exchange data side, where in the prior year we had -- the administrator takes kind of overbilled people and our allocation was a little bit higher, and so we had to reverse some of that in the first quarter. You'll see revenue in the second quarter pick back up as that kind of is no longer the case for us. And so I think you start to see a little bit better growth as we kind of move to the balance of the year within that segment because the underlying trends there are still the same as what we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters. \n Certainly, on the exchange data side, things are positive. We're seeing some momentum in listings for sure. But at the same time, there is M&A. There is still an element of delisting on the stack side that's weighing a little bit. So to get to that low single-digit, I don't think you necessarily need to see a big acceleration in listings. But certainly, we are seeing some positive things that I think are encouraging on that front. And I think the trends on the Exchange data side, particularly on the Futures side, I think we'll continue to be strong through the balance of the year. \nOperator: The next question comes from Brian Bedell with Deutsche Bank. \nBrian Bedell: Maybe just a two-parter on mortgage for Warren and Ben, just on the guidance for the segment. Maybe just your view on the trend of recurring revenue throughout the year as we progress sequentially each quarter. Just generally the trend, given the pullback in some of the renewals, the Black Knight servicing headwinds, contrasted with, and this links into probably, Ben, but contrasted with the really good progress you're making on the new business wins. And then if you could update us on the -- I think you were at $30 million out of the $125 million revenue synergy goal at the end of fourth quarter, if you could update that number on a run rate basis. \nWarren Gardiner: That sounds like three questions, Brian. I'll take 1 and 3, then Ben will take 2. So I think towards the higher end of that of the total -- of the range for total revenue, where we're talking about originations down more in the higher single-digit, mid- to high single-digit range versus 2023, which was also, by the way, the worst year for originations in probably about 30 years, I think you'd expect recurring revenues to be down a little bit year-over-year. I mean renewals will come in a little bit -- will be under a little bit of pressure, continue to be under a little bit of pressure. I would imagine decisions get pushed out a little bit, things of that nature.\n Towards the higher end, I think flat to maybe potentially a little bit softer versus last year's there and really for the same reasons, but is not really to the same magnitude that would see probably in the higher single-digit range, if you will on that front. So look, I think importantly, through all of this and what's kind of driving some of this, is just uncertainty across this asset class and certainly across a number of asset classes. And that uncertainty is helping to propel a lot of growth in other areas of our business. We've seen some better trends in both bonds. We've seen better trends in CDS in April. Obviously, our Futures business is doing really well. \n And so this mortgage is part of a bigger and broader business that has proven to continue to compound through a lot of different environments. And I think that will continue to be the case despite what is kind of a really a generational low in industry origination volumes for the mortgage market at the moment. Quickly on -- just on the revenue synergies, we continue to make progress there. As we said, we're sort of around that $30 million or so range last quarter. We continue to make progress on that front. We'll give you guys more of an update as we kind of move into -- closer to next year though. \nBenjamin Jackson: And I'll pick up on some of the comments that I made earlier around sales. So we continue to have great sales success. We're really happy with the success that we're having with our clients and the fact that even this environment, and I use the analogy, when the tides are out, we're so pleased to see that clients right now are making investments at this point in time to be able to better position that when the tide comes in and when volumes start to return that they don't have to just throw bodies to the business in a very inefficient way that they can actually leverage technology and automation that we're providing to help them grow. So we're very pleased in what we're seeing there. \n We're actually using it as also, Brian, as an opportunity to help our clients. So I'll give you an example. In our D&A business, we had some noise in our D&A line this past quarter, where we had some clients that were legacy clients of our data and document automation platform that were not on Encompass, and they were struggling in terms of volumes and in this environment. We took it as an opportunity to restructure their agreement to, in some cases, get them onto Encompass coupled with DDA so that they can get the full value that, that combined solution provides by having the loans originated on Encompass and then the automation capabilities to flow straight through, because we have wedded that DDA platform directly into the Encompass platform. \n So we're using it as an opportunity, that even though we now have to implement that client, it's going to take time to get them implemented. From a strategic perspective, we're in a much better situation with that client to continue to grow with them and provide value to that client going forward. And that example is specifically Citizens Bank, as they're now on Encompass, they have the DDA platform and they have MSP as a complete front-to-back solution set for them. So we're using it as an opportunity for clients as well. \nOperator: The next question comes from Alex Blostein with Goldman Sachs. \nAlexander Blostein: I wanted to pivot a little bit, maybe focus on the energy markets for a couple of minutes. And specifically just zoning in on oil. Now volatility has been a little bit more conducive to the environment here. But it looks like the open interest has been growing really nicely north of 20% or so year-over-year. So a couple of questions here. I guess, what is driving, I guess, the accelerated growth in oil for you guys across the board? It's not just brand and WTI, but it seems a little bit broader. And then how do you think about the sort of the structural versus cyclical benefits in that market? Are we in a kind of higher run rate growth from here? And if so, why? And maybe you can just expand out sort of the sources of growth there. \nBenjamin Jackson: Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. And for us, we see it as a long-term growth trend for us, to answer the tail end of that question that you asked there because in our view, the trends within energy broadly as well as within oil specifically, are still that there's been underinvestment in legacy energy infrastructure. The markets are still electronifying. The market wants the efficiency that can be provided by the electronification. You have energy markets that are more global. Supply chains are continuing to evolve. Clients want more precision in their ability to manage risk at the point of production and consumption. And the world is moving more green. So you have that confluence of issues. \n And we've been managing our portfolio across energy as a portfolio that helps to solve all of those problems. So we've built deep liquid products across our gas business, hundreds of locations and benchmark products within our gas business. We've done the same exact thing within our oil business, and we've done the same thing in our environmental business. So there's a relationship between all of those that we think is strong and you can't discount that as an underlying thing that's growing our overall complex because customers want to manage all this risk in one place. \n So we continue to be very well positioned. You have Brent as the cornerstone of this business. I went through in my prepared remarks, and we've talked about a lot of the innovation that we've introduced to this market over the last 3 years with our Murban contract growing significantly, with our HOU contract which now has Midland WTI oil basis, Houston flowing into the Brent contract, we are so well positioned across that complex to grow as our clients need the precision of these risk management tools that it's fantastic for us. \n And even in oil, I'd point out that we've been, from an environmental perspective, investing in new contracts like our RINs contracts, renewable identification numbers, as the EPA continues to raise the number of -- the amount of renewable fuels that needs to be blended into gasoline. And that used to be a very much an OTC opaque market. And we've introduced futures into that, and it's been growing very nicely for us as well. So we continue to innovate in this space, not only within oil, but I think it's important to look at it in the broader context of our energy business. \nOperator: We have no further questions, so I hand back to Jeff Sprecher, CEO, for closing remarks. \nJeffrey Sprecher: Well, thank you, Emily. Thanks all for joining us this morning, and I want to thank my colleagues again for a record first quarter and our customers for their continued business and trust. And we look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to try to innovate and build out this all-weather business model. Have a good day. \nOperator: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. This concludes our call, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Warren Gardiner",
            "content": "Thanks, Katia. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'll begin on Slide 4 with a summary of our strong first quarter results.  \n First quarter net revenues totaled a record $2.3 billion. and pro forma for the acquisition of Black Knight, increased by 5% versus last year. First quarter adjusted operating expenses totaled $930 million, at the low end of our guidance range, driven by an acceleration of planned expense synergies and a few onetime benefits within compensation costs.  \n Moving to the balance of the year. We expect second quarter adjusted operating expenses to be in the range of $945 million to $955 million, with a sequential increase driven in part by a full quarter of merit increases across the organization, planned investments and the modernization of MSP and higher D&A as recent revenue-related data center investments go live.  \n In addition and in part due to synergies being realized sooner than previously expected, we are lowering our full year expense guidance to $3.79 billion to $3.82 billion. \n This strong first quarter performance helped to drive record adjusted operating income of $1.4 billion, up 8% year-over-year on a pro forma basis and a record earnings per share of $1.48. First quarter free cash flow totaled $877 million, enabling us to reduce debt outstanding by roughly $600 million in the first quarter. Since we completed our acquisition of Black Knight in September,  we've reduced debt by roughly $2 billion. And as a result, adjusted leverage ended the first quarter approximately 3.9x pro forma EBITDA, with first quarter interest expense down $10 million from the fourth quarter.  \n Now let's move to Slide 5, where I'll provide an overview of the performance of our Exchange segments. First quarter net revenues totaled a record $1.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Record transaction revenues of $866 million were up 16%, in part driven by a 12% increase in our interest rate business and record energy revenues, which grew 32% year-over-year. This strong performance included a 28% increase in our oil complex, 42% growth in global natural gas revenues driven by another record-setting quarter for TTF, and 26% growth in our environmental business. In addition, as of the end of April, open interest is up 23% year-over-year, including 22% growth in our global commodities and 25% growth in our energy markets.  \n Shifting to recurring revenues, which include our Exchange data services and our NYC Listings business, revenue totaled $357 million in the first quarter. Similar to last quarter, growth in the number of customers consuming our global energy and environmental data was partially offset by the rolling off of initial listing fees related to the strong IPO market in 2021 and lower exchange data revenue at the NYSE. It's worth noting that the IPO market has shown signs of improvement so far in 2024, with the NYSE capturing nearly 70% of total proceeds raised and welcoming 6 of the top 7 IPOs year-to-date, despite more than 50% of new listings not meeting our gold standard of qualification criteria.  \n Turning now to Slide 6. I'll discuss our Fixed Income & Data Services segment. First quarter revenues totaled a record $568 million. Transaction revenues of $119 million were driven by growth in corporate bond trading, which was in part driven by strong growth within our institutional channel. This is offset by lower treasury and CD volumes as well as lower levels of CDS clearing activity. Record recurring revenues totaled $449 million and grew by 4% year-over-year. In our fixed income and data analytics business, record first quarter revenues of $288 million increased by 4%. \n Growth was once again driven by improving trends in our PRD business and another quarter of double-digit growth in our index business. Importantly, fixed income data and analytics ASV, or annual subscription value, improved from the 2% range experienced through much of 2023 to 4% exiting the first quarter as we continue to see customer reengagement and investment across the fixed income ecosystem.  \n Other Data & Network Services grew 4% in the first quarter, driven by our feeds business and continued strength in our oil and gas desktop solutions, both of which grew double digits year-over-year. Importantly, demand for our connectivity solutions remains strong with the backlog of signatures related to our ICE Global Network offering expected to come online and into both ASV and revenue in early July following the build-out of additional data center capacity. As a result, we expect second quarter year-over-year growth in overall recurring revenue to be similar to the first quarter, with year-over-year growth improving in the second half, driven by continued strong trends across fixed income data and analytics, and an acceleration in growth in our other data and network services businesses.  \n Please flip to Slide 7, where I will discuss the results in our Mortgage Technology segment. Please note that my comments are on a pro forma basis. ICE Mortgage Technology revenues totaled $499 million in the first quarter. Recurring revenues totaled $390 billion (sic) [$390 million]. As we noted last quarter, recurring revenues were impacted by both industry consolidation and continued pressure on renewals within our origination technology business. It's worth noting that while current macro conditions are putting pressure on minimums at renewal, and thus, our recurring revenues, customers are overwhelmingly remaining on our platform.  \n And while yet to manifest in our results, lower minimums upon renewal are paired with a higher price per transaction, a dynamic that will provide an incremental tailwind when industry volumes normalize. Said differently, total contract value in a normal market is on average increasing upon renewal. \n Transaction revenues totaled $109 million in the first quarter. While closed loans increased slightly, this was offset by lower professional services fees and lower default management revenues within our servicing business. Importantly, as I previously indicated, we have realized expense synergies faster than originally anticipated, which, when coupled with a relatively stable top line on a year-over-year basis, has helped to drive an 8% increase in segment operating income.  \n Looking to the full year and after factoring in the dramatic shift in interest rate expectations for 2024 relative to just 3 months ago, we now expect total revenue growth in our Mortgage Technology business to be flat to down in the low single-digit range, with revenues unlikely to improve materially from the first quarter levels until the second half. The high end of the range is underpinned by a flat-to-modest improvement in industry origination volumes or the lower end of the range anticipates a more conservative decline in the mid- to high single-digit range relative to 2023.  \n Despite these macro pressures, we continue to invest in product development and enhancement. We continue to expand our existing network and we are executing on our synergy targets, all of which further position our platform to realize accelerating growth when market conditions normalize.  \n In summary, we delivered another very strong start to the year. We once again delivered strong revenue, operating income, free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share growth. And we continue to invest across our business to meet both the needs of our customers and to position our business to continue to deliver consistent and compounding growth for our stockholders into the future.  \n I'll be happy to take your questions during Q&A. But for now, I'll hand it over to Ben. Sure, Ben. Let me start on that transaction. I'm going to turn it to Ben to give you some color more on what's going on with the customer front. So yes, you're correct. I mean when we thought about guidance last quarter and we gave you that guidance, the high end of that range really was taking in what some of the forecasters were giving you in terms of what they thought the year was going to look like. And we wanted to build in towards the lower end of that range, a little bit more of a conservative outlook.\n You've seen that they brought those down as well, and that actually now -- so that same framework was how we were thinking about this as we revised guidance this quarter because we've now taken it down sort of similar -- at least at the high end towards where they're sitting at the moment and that we wanted to put a little bit more of a conservative bent on it towards the lower end of that range as we move forward. There's obviously a lot of uncertainty around what the trajectory of interest rates and, therefore, mortgage bonds are going to look like as we move through the balance of the year. And so that was how we were thinking about it from an origination standpoint and just the macro impact that, that has on the customer base as they think about making decisions and things of that nature. Craig, it's Warren. So I think Chris and Lynn just covered kind of what we were seeing on the customer front, and that's a big part of why you're seeing that pickup in ASV in the Fixed Income & Data and Analytics business. So -- and so we've seen pretty stable retention trends. We're seeing an improvement in the sales cycle. We're seeing, as I said in my prepared remarks, more of a reengagement from the customer base within the fixed income ecosystem around those products, whether it's the pricing and reference data business or the index business. And that's really a big reason of why we're seeing the improvement there. \n And it's really -- as we spoke to you guys throughout the course of last year, we were having some pressures on that business. We mentioned that it was because we had a really sharp move on higher in interest rates. There was sort of a period of time there where customers were sitting on their hands trying to -- sort of licking their wounds, if you will, in a way. And now that we've seen somewhat of a stabilization here at these kinds of interest rates, fixed income becomes a fairly attractive asset class. And I think that's a lot of the reason you're seeing that reengagement, you're seeing some growth, you're seeing index purchases, things of that nature, that's really starting to help that business pick up versus where it was a couple of quarters ago. It's Warren. So yes, we still expect that to be in the low single-digit range. Really, what happened this quarter, I mentioned a little bit in my prepared remarks with more on the New York Stock Exchange data side, where in the prior year we had -- the administrator takes kind of overbilled people and our allocation was a little bit higher, and so we had to reverse some of that in the first quarter. You'll see revenue in the second quarter pick back up as that kind of is no longer the case for us. And so I think you start to see a little bit better growth as we kind of move to the balance of the year within that segment because the underlying trends there are still the same as what we've been seeing in the last couple of quarters. \n Certainly, on the exchange data side, things are positive. We're seeing some momentum in listings for sure. But at the same time, there is M&A. There is still an element of delisting on the stack side that's weighing a little bit. So to get to that low single-digit, I don't think you necessarily need to see a big acceleration in listings. But certainly, we are seeing some positive things that I think are encouraging on that front. And I think the trends on the Exchange data side, particularly on the Futures side, I think we'll continue to be strong through the balance of the year. That sounds like three questions, Brian. I'll take 1 and 3, then Ben will take 2. So I think towards the higher end of that of the total -- of the range for total revenue, where we're talking about originations down more in the higher single-digit, mid- to high single-digit range versus 2023, which was also, by the way, the worst year for originations in probably about 30 years, I think you'd expect recurring revenues to be down a little bit year-over-year. I mean renewals will come in a little bit -- will be under a little bit of pressure, continue to be under a little bit of pressure. I would imagine decisions get pushed out a little bit, things of that nature.\n Towards the higher end, I think flat to maybe potentially a little bit softer versus last year's there and really for the same reasons, but is not really to the same magnitude that would see probably in the higher single-digit range, if you will on that front. So look, I think importantly, through all of this and what's kind of driving some of this, is just uncertainty across this asset class and certainly across a number of asset classes. And that uncertainty is helping to propel a lot of growth in other areas of our business. We've seen some better trends in both bonds. We've seen better trends in CDS in April. Obviously, our Futures business is doing really well. \n And so this mortgage is part of a bigger and broader business that has proven to continue to compound through a lot of different environments. And I think that will continue to be the case despite what is kind of a really a generational low in industry origination volumes for the mortgage market at the moment. Quickly on -- just on the revenue synergies, we continue to make progress there. As we said, we're sort of around that $30 million or so range last quarter. We continue to make progress on that front. We'll give you guys more of an update as we kind of move into -- closer to next year though."

            "content": "Thank you, Warren, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Please turn to Slide 8. Our customers continue to rely on our leading technology, mission-critical data and transparent and accessible markets to navigate uncertainty while managing risk. Across our global Futures and Options business, total average daily volumes increased 16% to a record 8.1 million lots in the first quarter, including records across commodities, energy and total options. This strong performance drove record futures and options revenues, with energy revenues nearly tripling since the same period in 2010 and growing double digits on average over that time frame. And through April, open interest across our global commodities and energy markets remains at all-time highs, up 22% and 25%, respectively, versus last year. A direct benefit from the long tail of secular growth trends unfolding across global oil, natural gas and environmental markets.  \n A number of years ago, we recognized the importance of investing in an energy platform that is truly global, one that better serves the needs of an evolving and growing commercial customer base. Today, as a result of organic and inorganic investments, trading on our network is not tied to any single product or limited to any one region. Instead, we have built a diversified energy network, delivering comprehensive risk management solutions, providing capital efficiencies and positioned to grow alongside the continued evolution of global markets. \n In our oil markets, as trade dynamics evolve and become increasingly complex, customers seek not only liquidity in the global -- major global benchmarks, but also in products that provide for greater hedging precision. Reflecting this dynamic, our other crude and refined products continue to set records with ADV growing double digits on average over the past 5 years. This portfolio increased 47% year-over-year in the first quarter alone, while open interest is up 27% through the end of April.  \n In the more than 20 years that ICE has been building its global energy platform, we have created hundreds of precise hedging instruments, driven by collaboration with our customers. All of these instruments are underpinned by the deep liquidity in our benchmarks such as Brent. In March 2021, in partnership with the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company and 9 of the world's largest energy traders as founding partners, we launched ICE Futures Abu Dhabi, or IFAD. This new exchange enabled for the first time, market participants to come together and contribute to the price formation of a new innovation, the Murban Futures contract, an important benchmark for oil flowing to Asia.  \n In the first quarter, as IFAD marked its third anniversary, our Murban Futures reached new highs, surpassing over 1 million contracts traded along with a series of open interest records in April. Similarly, our Platts Dubai contract had another quarter of record volumes, increasing 58% year-over-year. \n Another innovation that we launched 2 years ago, the Midland WTI contract known as HOU, is a deliverable crude grade of Midland oil based in Houston. This contract is fast becoming the most accurate representation of the Houston oil market as evidenced by HOU reaching record volumes during the quarter. Further supporting the growth of this new risk management innovation is that this oil has been added into the ICE Brent basket, which creates new opportunities for clients to manage risk by hedging with this contract. Collectively, this strong performance drove another quarter of record oil revenues, up 28% year-over-year.  \n In our natural gas markets, the globalization of gas and the rise of LNG are secular trends we began investing in over a decade ago, beginning with our index investment, an investment that has established us as a leader in European gas trading. Today, with Asia as the largest buyer of global LNG, the relationship between our European TTF and Asian JKM benchmarks drives global price formation. In the first quarter, the number of market participants in each market grew double digits versus last year, with both reaching record volumes.  \n This strong performance drove record natural gas revenues, up 42% year-over-year in the first quarter. Importantly, open interest trends for TTF and JKM remained strong through April, up 90% and 50% year-over-year, respectively. The globalization of natural gas alongside a global focus on decarbonization is critical to environmental markets, built off of our acquisition of the Climate Exchange more than a decade ago, we operate the world's largest and most liquid environmental markets. Here, we have seen the number of active market participants grow double digits on average over the past 5 years, including record participation in the first quarter.  \n At the same time, ADV across our environmental portfolio increased 22% year-over-year, with open interest up 27% through the end of April. Price transparency across the energy spectrum is critical as companies look to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective manner. By combining the network and liquidity of our global energy platform with our leading environmental portfolio, we are well positioned to help our customers navigate this transition across global energy markets.  \n In summary, the evolution of our energy markets is one example of how we continuously invest and develop customer-driven solutions across asset classes, as well as the creative approach we've taken to leverage our infrastructure, technology and expertise to drive value creation. Our record performance is a product of these investments, some that we've made more than a decade ago, and our commitment to staying close to our customers, an approach that permeates this organization, helping to drive effective and efficient product innovation.  \n This approach is also important to our data business, where we are uniquely positioned to leverage our distribution and our infrastructure to create new content and to expand the breadth of our offering. Our position as a leading provider of price and reference data have served as the foundation for what is today one of the largest providers of fixed income indices globally. The accelerating growth of passive investing and the efforts we've made to increase the breadth of our offering, and the flexibility of our approach to index construction, has contributed to the double-digit average annual growth in our index business since we acquired the Bank of America Merrill Lynch franchise in 2017.  \n A key driver of this growth is the increase in the passive ETF assets under management benchmarked to our indices, growing to a record of $593 billion through the end of the first quarter from less than $100 billion in 2017. \n While critical, our pricing data and index businesses are only components of what we offer to this growing industry. As a leading provider of such proprietary data services, we have developed deep expertise in gathering and cleansing unstructured data, skills in building the database that serves as the foundation for developing actionable insights and identifying opportunities not only in the fixed income markets, but across many other asset classes.  \n This is an expertise we're starting to leverage across a number of mortgage data initiatives. For example, in April, we announced the integration of our property and loan-level mortgage data sets with our property-level climate risk metrics covering more than 100 million U.S. homes. This integration improves transparency and facilitates risk management throughout the housing finance and property insurance sector, allowing customers to apply ICE's climate metrics to individual loans, properties and entire portfolios, improving the visibility to the inherent climate risks in each.  \n In addition, we are leveraging these insights to enhance asset-level climate risk modeling for existing municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities products. As we move forward, there is significant opportunity to continue to expand and evolve the products and services within our Fixed Income & Data Services business.  \n Turning now to our mortgage business. Following the proven playbook we've applied across our global energy and fixed income businesses, in mortgages, we are leveraging market-leading technology, mission-critical data and our network expertise to build innovative solutions that improve workflow efficiencies. With a touch point to nearly every market participant, we have connectivity to a customer base in need of the automation that our digital solutions provide.  \n In this regard, we're pleased to share that we closed 20 new Encompass clients in the first quarter. Building on the wins we announced last year with banks such as M&T and JPMorgan Chase and the announcement earlier this year of adding Fifth Third Bank to Encompass on top of their move to MSP announced late last year, we are pleased to now announce that Citizens Bank and Webster Bank, both existing MSP clients, are moving to Encompass. Just like many of the other recent wins that we are implementing, these clients see the significant value that we can provide through our complete front-to-back offering.  \n For MSP, building on the capital mortgage solutions of Texas and CapEd Credit Union wins mentioned on the last call, we closed Lennar, a long-time Encompass client. \n Our growing customer relationships serve as a validation of our vision, bringing together a complete front-to-back experience for our customers and their clients through one trusted platform. Our clients seek a solution provider that supports digital workflows throughout the home-ownership life cycle, starting with matching a consumer to the right lending product at the right time on the loan origination, closing, servicing in the capital markets. This is directly in line with our long-term vision and the journey we have been on.  \n Importantly, we remain focused on executing on our strategy of relieving the pain points and inefficiencies that exist across the mortgage workflow, and remain committed to investing behind secular growth while enhancing the value proposition of our network. For example, we have completed the evolution of Encompass to a new web user experience, with new automation tools and more ways to partner and extend the platform to serve our customers' business needs. In parallel, we're executing on our investment commitments to continue to advance our market-leading MSP servicing platform. \n A perfect example of this execution is the recently announced rollout of our MSP Digital Experience, or MSP DX. This service is an intuitive and conversational new interface, leveraging natural language processing for our servicing system designed to streamline workflows, increase efficiencies and expedite training of new servicing personnel. Along the same lines, we've completed our first integration of Encompass to MSP. \n This integration leverages our data and document automation platform, and our neural network large language model for the classification and extraction of data from documents to automate loan onboarding from Encompass straight to MSP, reducing errors and providing significant efficiencies to clients that have our front-to-back solution set. Simultaneously, we've been integrating our tax, flood and closing fees into Encompass, providing lenders more choice in service providers for these important underwriting data assets. \n In summary, as we move through 2024 and beyond, we are excited about the many opportunities for growth that lie ahead. Opportunities that we're able to capture because of the investments we've made in the past and the strategic investments we will continue to make across our networks into the future. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jeff. Ken, it's Ben. Thanks for the question. And I'll take the first part of your question first, and then I'll hit the second part. In terms of natural gas, we believe that TTF is a long, long runway to go. And what really fundamentally changed is that natural gas has been liberalized. It's no longer wedded to just pipeline flows, and it can now move freely around the world in the form of LNG. And there have been massive investments in LNG terminals and regasification terminals around the world that have really changed and evolved gas into a global commodity, and TTF has emerged as the global way to hedge that risk. \n And if you look at all the risks around the world right now and across Europe and the U.S., we believe that you need to have not only benchmark products, but you also have to have products that enable people to manage risk at more precise hedging locations as well in parallel to products like TTF. I mean, right now, you look at the dynamics, the European gas markets have recovered to some degree, with U.S. LNG now flowing into Europe. You've got regasification terminals that have come online in Germany and the Netherlands that have helped. Storage has been at high levels this past winter. We had a mild winter in Europe. But you still have a backdrop of geopolitical risks that introduced tail risk and ongoing risk to energy supply that are going to continue to evolve supply chains around the natural gas market. \n And now that gas can move freely, we think there's going to be a tremendous amount of opportunities for clients to use our products to hedge all of those risks, the confluence of those risks and as those things change and evolve. And as you pointed out, TTF has had a tremendous runway here. Our open interest is up 90% year-over-year and volumes are up 60%. \n In terms of the White House pausing on new permits for LNG exporters from the U.S., we see this as just another speed bump, you used the right word, along the way, that market participants have to look at and determine what risk does this introduce to me. It takes years for this to have an impact. Permits that are in place now, take years to come online. So it's more of a longer-term implication for the market to absorb. But on the same token, you have a new LNG terminal coming online in Canada soon. So you're going to continue to see LNG as it's been liberalized move around the world. That risk needs to be managed, and TTF is the fundamental place that it's done. Ben, I'll follow up on the second part of your question there. We have 100% conviction on the ability for this business to grow over the long term. And we continued quarter-over-quarter to just give more and more evidence to the fact with just customer wins that are coming on board. So we feel great that even in this volume environment, that is an environment that hasn't been seen almost in a generation since 1991, that we're continuing to bring customers onto our platform into our ecosystem and continuing to gain in that area.\n A couple of things. Obviously, in this past quarter, the industry shifted from a rate cut expectation of 5 to 6 cuts in 2024 to what seems like now is 1, maybe 2, and this happened rapidly. So we're watching and monitoring what's happening with our clients as a result of that. The couple of things I'd point out. Customers are renewing and renewing at very high levels. \n On the renewal front, we're seeing almost a repeat of what we've seen and what I've talked about in several quarters now that the majority of our customers are renewing and they're renewing at higher minimums, higher subscription levels. But we are seeing some percentage of those customers that are choosing to renew with lower minimums, lower subscriptions. But the trade-off there is consistently a higher foreclosed loan fee. And our objective on all of these renewals, which we're achieving, is to increase the total contract value that these customers are, regardless of which way that go in that negotiation based on the value that we're continuing to provide with all the new innovation that we're introducing into the marketplace. \n So in terms of renewals, we're not really seeing a significant change. On the sales front, we continue to have great sales success. I just mentioned several new wins on top of other wins that we've announced recently with Citizens Bank and Webster Bank. So we feel good about the funnel. What's unknown and what we're just watching closely is that just given how fast rate expectations changed, a lot of our market participants want market stability and want a view as to when they're going to get return on investments. So we're watching closely to see our sales cycles going to potentially lengthen. But for the most part, we are seeing customers continuing to take this time while the tide is out to invest in this critical infrastructure, so that when the tide comes back in, they're well-positioned to capitalize on them. Thanks, Dan. It's Ben. In terms of these large clients that we've signed, it does take time to implement them. These systems are core to their operations. There's a high amount of compliance that's managed through these applications. So it takes time to bed them down in highly regulated companies. So it is going to take time for those to flow through. But many of them, as they -- as we've been announcing a lot of these wins through last year, is going to start playing out towards the latter part of this year. And into next year, you'll start seeing contribution of those. \n On the servicing side, the servicing business is doing very well. From our perspective, we -- and we mentioned it on last call, there has been some industry consolidation that did impact a little bit in Q1. You do have MSRs, mortgage servicing rights, that do switch at times between subservicers, some that are on MSP and some that are not on MSP. And we saw some of that again in Q1, but the net effect is it basically nets out. \n One change we did see was -- in this past quarter was we did see an acceleration from one of the large depositories that's been very public about wanting to sell some of what they saw as their nonstrategic MSRs that came through their correspondent channel. So we saw an acceleration of that. We see that as a temporary thing. But overall, on MSP, we have a record number of clients that are on MSP with 94 clients, and we have 13 clients that are going through implementation. Many of these are ones that we've announced since we closed on Black Knight and have they really accelerated the ability to pick up a lot of these clients. \n The second thing I'd point out is that on the servicing side, I'm really pleased with our execution in terms of modernizing that technology stack. I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the new natural language processing-based platform and MSP DX, so the whole interface that the clients use to interface that with the servicing system has been overhauled already. As I mentioned on our prior call, we've embedded the Simplifile platform into the back end of MSP to automate the process of releasing liens, so really unique position we are in to automate that with the platform that we have in Simplifile. \n We've -- as mentioned in my prepared remarks, we've integrated Encompass to MSP, leveraging our data and document automation platform. And the last thing I'd point out is a lot of these Encompass wins that I keep mentioning are clients that are on MSP. Webster and Citizens Bank are 2 perfect examples, where they're on MSP and the clients see the efficiency and the vision -- the efficiency that we provide and the vision of where we're going is really helping us pull through Encompass wins. So we feel great about the positioning of it. And I'll pick up on some of the comments that I made earlier around sales. So we continue to have great sales success. We're really happy with the success that we're having with our clients and the fact that even this environment, and I use the analogy, when the tides are out, we're so pleased to see that clients right now are making investments at this point in time to be able to better position that when the tide comes in and when volumes start to return that they don't have to just throw bodies to the business in a very inefficient way that they can actually leverage technology and automation that we're providing to help them grow. So we're very pleased in what we're seeing there. \n We're actually using it as also, Brian, as an opportunity to help our clients. So I'll give you an example. In our D&A business, we had some noise in our D&A line this past quarter, where we had some clients that were legacy clients of our data and document automation platform that were not on Encompass, and they were struggling in terms of volumes and in this environment. We took it as an opportunity to restructure their agreement to, in some cases, get them onto Encompass coupled with DDA so that they can get the full value that, that combined solution provides by having the loans originated on Encompass and then the automation capabilities to flow straight through, because we have wedded that DDA platform directly into the Encompass platform. \n So we're using it as an opportunity, that even though we now have to implement that client, it's going to take time to get them implemented. From a strategic perspective, we're in a much better situation with that client to continue to grow with them and provide value to that client going forward. And that example is specifically Citizens Bank, as they're now on Encompass, they have the DDA platform and they have MSP as a complete front-to-back solution set for them. So we're using it as an opportunity for clients as well. Thanks, Alex. It's Ben. And for us, we see it as a long-term growth trend for us, to answer the tail end of that question that you asked there because in our view, the trends within energy broadly as well as within oil specifically, are still that there's been underinvestment in legacy energy infrastructure. The markets are still electronifying. The market wants the efficiency that can be provided by the electronification. You have energy markets that are more global. Supply chains are continuing to evolve. Clients want more precision in their ability to manage risk at the point of production and consumption. And the world is moving more green. So you have that confluence of issues. \n And we've been managing our portfolio across energy as a portfolio that helps to solve all of those problems. So we've built deep liquid products across our gas business, hundreds of locations and benchmark products within our gas business. We've done the same exact thing within our oil business, and we've done the same thing in our environmental business. So there's a relationship between all of those that we think is strong and you can't discount that as an underlying thing that's growing our overall complex because customers want to manage all this risk in one place. \n So we continue to be very well positioned. You have Brent as the cornerstone of this business. I went through in my prepared remarks, and we've talked about a lot of the innovation that we've introduced to this market over the last 3 years with our Murban contract growing significantly, with our HOU contract which now has Midland WTI oil basis, Houston flowing into the Brent contract, we are so well positioned across that complex to grow as our clients need the precision of these risk management tools that it's fantastic for us. \n And even in oil, I'd point out that we've been, from an environmental perspective, investing in new contracts like our RINs contracts, renewable identification numbers, as the EPA continues to raise the number of -- the amount of renewable fuels that needs to be blended into gasoline. And that used to be a very much an OTC opaque market. And we've introduced futures into that, and it's been growing very nicely for us as well. So we continue to innovate in this space, not only within oil, but I think it's important to look at it in the broader context of our energy business."

            "content": "Thank you, Ben. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Please turn to Slide 9. We are increasingly being asked how ICE is incorporating artificial intelligence into our business. So while I'm not here to discuss the financial impact, I thought I'd touch on some of the AI investments across ICE. \n Like many large corporations, we have developers working on how to integrate AI models into our products, on how we better contract for and monetize our proprietary data sets and on how we improve our own productivity. Along those lines, we created an internal R&D group that we're calling our AI Center of Excellence, where we're testing novel use cases and working to build appropriate governance card guardrails to reduce or eliminate the risks inherent to AI. We are focused on getting it right, while working towards a goal of bringing AI-enabled enhancements and new products to our customers. \n Ben just spoke about investing in our mortgage data and document automation product, which is an extension of the product formerly called AIQ that we acquired with Ellie Mae. We've also mentioned investing in our commodity chat platform called, ICE Chat, to improve upon actionable insights and market data. And we've commented on our work using artificial intelligence models for pattern recognition in our regulatory compliance activities. Today, I'd like to further speak to some of the lesser-known, second-order impacts of the market's current energetic focus on AI that we see feeding growth to ICE. \n If you think back to the start of ICE, the prevalent financial exchanges were largely open outcry venues, and both listed and over-the-counter trading involve significant involvement of human intermediaries. Our thesis of using digital networks to connect people and broaden access to risk management pushed us to create and manage our own data centers and network channels. Today, we operate from 14 global data centers, and we've built out the ICE Cloud, a managed network, connecting our data centers to many third-party trading and data venues, and interconnecting major players across the global financial services industry. \n We've made the determination that managing our own IT infrastructure and making it available to our customers directly and through an ICE-managed cloud offers us a competitive advantage while providing for better intellectual property protection and creating an avenue for our connectivity and data revenue growth. One service that we offer our customers is the ability to utilize their code and equipment within the ICE global network and transmit the digital output across the ICE-managed cloud. This ICE strategy has resulted in requests from customers to incorporate their AI models inside our network, and it's driving increasing demand for ICE Data Center and ICE Cloud access. \n We've already received customer deposits for much of our planned year 2025 and year 2026 network build-outs, and we've been working with our vendors to plan for its continued expansion. This customer interest in artificial intelligence modeling should provide a multiyear tailwind to revenue growth in our data and connectivity business. Another second-order revenue impact from the current interest in AI is the attention that our listed emissions offset markets and our listed renewable energy markets are receiving from power companies and third-party data center developers as they plan for their future growth, given that ICE is a major host of the world's tradable emission and renewable energy markets. \n Our subsidiary, ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers regulated benchmarks, manages our carbon market data service that provides validated data to companies seeking information about the voluntary markets for carbon credits. Interest in these markets is surging as evidenced by corporate involvement more than doubling over the past 6 months to more than 250 firms. And last month, the United Nations Science-based Target Initiative, the world's main verifier of emissions targets, said that it will permit the use of emission offset credits to count towards reducing emissions against Scope 3 targets. \n Coupled with the European Commission's aim to increase its emissions reductions beginning in 2024, plus the EU's inclusion of new industrial sectors that will be subject to these targets, we believe the backdrop for revenue growth in ICE's environmental and renewable markets attributable to AI model demand remains bright. \n Shifting now to our strong results. In the first quarter, we once again grew revenues, grew adjusted operating income and grew adjusted earnings per share, yet again delivering the best quarter in our company's history. Our consistent results are a testament to the value of our mission-critical data, leading market technology and the strength of our strategic business model. ICE is a company that has deliberately grown through curated acquisition and entrepreneurship. We have targeted an interrelated collection of markets to help our customers manage risk due to both acts of nature and acts of man. \n Typically, we think of our global commodity-oriented businesses is being levered to acts of nature, such as issues that affect supply chain flows. And we think of our global financially oriented risk management businesses as being levered to acts of man, such as Central Bank and cross-border trade policies. We purposely have targeted providing a mix of these businesses to find growth somewhere in the world in varying underlying conditions. And we have intentionally positioned our company to provide customer solutions to facilitate all-weather results, such as those we are reporting for this record quarter. \n I'd like to end my prepared remarks by thanking our customers for their continued business and for their trust. And I'd like to thank my colleagues at ICE for their contributions to our best-ever quarterly results. \n And with that, I'll now turn the call back to our moderator, Emily, and we'll conduct a question-and-answer session until 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time. Well, thank you, Emily. Thanks all for joining us this morning, and I want to thank my colleagues again for a record first quarter and our customers for their continued business and trust. And we look forward to updating you again soon as we continue to try to innovate and build out this all-weather business model. Have a good day."

            "content": "Yes. Thanks, Lynn. And Patrick, thanks for the question. What I've seen from being in the role since January 1, is this opportunity on the execution side for us to draw closer what we're seeing in the development of SMA or separate managed accounts to the institutional trading that's going on there. There's a deep desire across the street that get closer to those 2 pools of liquidity, and we're uniquely positioned to provide that opportunity. And as Lynn mentioned, bringing the data, so everyone is looking at exactly the same marks and valuations for those transaction values has been an important way for us to step up to the plate and provide that solution that is unique across the street and available to us and our clients. It's Chris. I -- what I would say, I've seen since taking on the role is two really things, one macro and one, I think, related to us. Certainly, there's a focus on the client base to find the most comprehensive solution set that's available, and they're looking for opportunities around there to tie that into single or very few vendors to provide that. And we also made a change in how we have service to clients since January. And so we moved to a different structure within the team itself, and I'm very proud of the team and the results they produced from that because they're much closer to the client these days. \n And those two things come together, we've seen a shortened sales cycle on some of the products that we have historically had great success with. We've also seen a much more robust discussion on future strategic plans on the client base. So I think we're well positioned going into the rest of the year to bring that to bear."
