[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Ashish Saran, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO. I would like to remind everyone that certain comments today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and which could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review these cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our website in the Investor Relations section. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. \nMatthew Murphy: Great. Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a quick recap of Marvell's financial highlights for fiscal year 2020. Our GAAP revenue was $2.7 billion, GAAP gross margin was 50.3%, and GAAP income per diluted share was $2.34. On a non-GAAP basis, our gross margin was 63.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.66. Fiscal 2020 was clearly a challenging year for the semiconductor industry. But against this backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty, Marvell continues to take bold steps towards becoming a leader in infrastructure solutions. Not only did we achieve the complete realization of synergies from the integration of Cavium in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 2 quarters ahead of schedule, we announced and closed 3 additional strategic transactions within the year. We acquired Aquantia and Avera and divested our Wi-Fi business. In fact, the integration of Aquantia and Avera is well ahead of plan and this is reflected in our lower OpEx expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which Jean will discuss in her section. Implementing all the key learnings from the Cavium acquisition, our IT and operations team did an amazing job in completing the ERP integration of Aquantia in 1 day and Avera within 5 days of closing the transactions. \n In addition to the portfolio transformation, we won a number of key designs in fiscal 2020, which we expect will fuel multiple years of revenue growth for the company. In wireless infrastructure, we started ramping our first-generation of 5G processors at Samsung, won their next-generation 5G baseband processor; and yesterday, we announced an even deeper collaboration with them. During the last year, we also won a fronthaul interface chip and entered into the radio head with processors from massive MIMO. \n Equally exciting, earlier today, Nokia announced an expanded relationship with Marvell on 5G infrastructure solutions, which I will discuss later in the call. \n In Ethernet connectivity, we won a number of designs at leading networking OEMs with our switch and PHY solutions. In storage, we started to ship and ramp preamps and controllers into high capacity 16-terabyte near line drives and secured the follow-on controller for the next-generation platform, targeting higher capacity points, well into the 20-plus terabyte range. \n We released our NVMe over Fabric Ethernet SSD controller and a family of PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD controllers, which are also powering our first major DIY win. As we start fiscal 2021, we are excited about a number of product ramps, but are also trying to assess the near-term impact from the coronavirus. \n Clearly, the safety and well-being of our employees is our highest concern, and I want to express my sincere support for all our people in China who have been the most impacted. Prior to the outbreak gaining intensity, our bookings and backlog were getting stronger going into fiscal year 2021, driven by our own product cycles, such as the start of our 5G product ramp, our success in nearline drives and a recovery in our core business. In addition, the signing of the Phase 1 trade deal between the U.S. and China was helpful in erasing trade tensions, which had affected our business last year. But recently, as the virus impact has become broader, we have started to see supply chain-related impacts to our business. \n It is impossible for us to fully quantify the effect of the situation as our business -- on our business as it remains fluid. However, our revenue guidance for the first quarter includes a 5% reduction based on what we know so far. In addition, given the ongoing uncertainty, we have also temporarily widened our guidance range on revenue from plus or minus 3% to plus or minus 5%. \n Let's move on to our quarterly performance. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered solid results and achieved $718 million in revenue, above the midpoint of the revised guidance we had provided on December 6, after we completed the divestiture of our Wi-Fi business. Our GAAP income per share was $2.62, and our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.17. \n First, in our networking business, revenue during the quarter was $377 million and grew 14% sequentially. The double-digit growth was primarily due to full quarter contributions from the Avera and Aquantia acquisitions, partially offset by the divestiture of Wi-Fi. Both of our recent acquisitions were off to a running start with the Avera ASIC business delivering a solid quarter, and Aquantia's revenue trajectory continuing to improve as those customers completed inventory digestion. The bookings trends for both of these acquisitions support the full year expectations we had communicated last year. \n While the Avera design team continues to work on completing designs they had won prior to the acquisition, they are also engaging with existing Marvell customers who had not worked with them in recent years. The overall opportunity pipeline for Avera is very healthy and continues to broaden. Outside of the 2 acquisitions, wireless infrastructure shipments remain strong and enterprise performed as expected. In addition, we experienced strong booking trends in networking before the recent coronavirus impact clouded the outlook. While we assess the impact from this event, we continue to make progress on securing additional design wins in a number of key end markets. \n I'll start with the wireless infrastructure market. Yesterday, we announced an extension of our long-term collaboration with Samsung across additional segments of the radio access network. We have been working with Samsung closely to deliver multiple generations of baseband and Control Plane solutions for both 4G and now 5G base stations, incorporating their intellectual property with Marvell's OCTEON and Fusion processors. More recently, we have also been partnering with them on innovative radio unit architectures designed to meet the dramatic increase in compute power required for the complex beamforming algorithms inherent to massive MIMO deployments. \n Equally exciting, earlier today, Nokia announced that we are broadening our relationship for the development of multiple generations of custom and multi-core ARM-based infrastructure processors for 5G. This is another example of the partnership model we offer, which enables our customers such as Nokia to integrate their unique technology into our programmable processor platform to develop customized products. It's really the best of both worlds, as our customers can focus their internal resources on their differentiated technology and embed that IP into the chipset. This significantly accelerates their time-to-market by utilizing other parts of the SoC subsystem from Marvell, such as the processor complex, which we have already developed and hardened for base stations. \n We are able to deliver this degree of customization with our field-proven, flexible SoC architecture in our Fusion products comprised of ARM cores, a variety of DSP cores tailored to our customers' requirements and customer developed IP blocks stitched together very efficiently by our unique interconnect to maximize performance. This programming model enables our customers to differentiate their solutions to their own IP and algorithms. In addition to providing the underlying architecture for our customized Fusion solutions, our OCTEON multi-core ARM-based infrastructure processors also provide control and data plane processing. \n We are looking forward to growing our business with Nokia as they benefit from the growing 5G wireless infrastructure market. We expect to start shipping the first custom product later this fiscal year, and we are also starting development of the next-generation of infrastructure processors and custom SoCs. In addition to the progress we are making at multiple Tier 1 wireless customers with our existing platforms, we are continuing to innovate in this market and are working with analog devices to pair their world-class RF transceiver technology with our broad digital 5G platform. \n We both recognized the growing complexity in 5G radio units with the proliferation of technologies, such as massive MIMO, which is driving an increased need for the very close collaboration between the RF and mixed-signal portion with the compute domain. This unique collaboration between the 2 best-of-breed suppliers will provide customers with significant improvements in size, power and performance within the increasingly complex radio unit. \n Before I move on from the wireless infrastructure market, let me spend a couple of minutes going over our perspective on the rollout of 5G, including the key drivers, the frequency bands in play such as sub-6 gigahertz versus millimeter wave and the pace of deployment. \n First, Why 5G? Very simply, it significantly lowers the cost per bit of wirelessly transporting data, which benefits both carriers from an OpEx perspective and consumers by enabling a better user experience. Our base assumption is that for the next few years the overall wireless CapEx envelope will remain similar to historical patterns, but the better economics of 5G will inevitably transition wireless CapEx away from legacy 4G technologies. Even under this flattish CapEx assumption, we expect to drive significant revenue growth as our content and share in 5G is considerably higher than what we had in 4G. Over time, we expect that 5G will also create newer opportunities beyond the handset, which could drive an upward inflection in CapEx, and that would represent an upside to our base case. On the subject of sub-6 gigahertz versus millimeter wave, while we believe that both modes of deployment will see significant activity over the next few years, our view is that the vast majority of 5G base station CapEx will be spent on sub-6 deployment. \n A leading industry analyst has a similar forecast projecting that over 95% of the spend to go towards sub-6 deployment. Accordingly, we expect our wireless infrastructure revenue to follow a similar pattern and primarily derive from macro base stations. Having said that, as the small cell market develops in 5G, especially for millimeter wave applications, we are ideally situated to address these opportunities with our multi-core processor architecture, which can easily be scaled down to the relatively lower power and performance footprint needed in small cells. Our platform also enables significant software reuse for our customers as they scale down their macro solutions. We have a full set of capabilities for the wireless infrastructure market, including baseband, transport, Ethernet connectivity and DFE ASICs, making us the ideal chip provider for small cells, which are likely to require the integration of multiple functions in a single-chip or package for power and space considerations. \n In terms of timing, this is an infrastructure business where shifts from one technology to another are typically over a multi-year period, with the rate of adoption constrained by flattish CapEx budgets. We're at the very beginning of a multiyear transition to 5G, and the vast majority of this opportunity is in front of us. As you are aware, Korea is the only major geography, which started 5G deployments in earnest in calendar 2019. And while Korea is an important region for our lead customer, most of their base station shipments in 2019 used FPGAs for processing, and they only started to transition to our solutions late in the year. As a result, we expect significant revenue growth this fiscal year from deployments by Korean operators, and these deployments will continue for a number of years. \n Additional growth opportunities are also in front of us from geographies such as Japan and the U.S., when they start to deploy 5G later this year. With respect to China, Marvell historically had very limited exposure to their wireless infrastructure market; however, with the Avera acquisition, and our own organic efforts, we are now better positioned to also participate in China's 5G deployments. \n In summary, the wireless industry is starting to see a convergence of factors important for 5G adoption, including a more mature supply ecosystem, both on handsets and base stations and the opening up of additional spectrum, especially in the important sub-6 gigahertz bands. This combined with the better economics of the newer technology is increasingly driving carriers to shift their CapEx to 5G base stations, especially in regions where they are considering turning on 5G services in the near future. \n New 5G base stations are, of course, backward compatible with 4G and allow carriers to future-proof their networks rather than continue spending on legacy technologies. So as a result, we expect that wireless CapEx will continue to accelerate to 5G on the infrastructure side. Now let me shift gears from the 5G deep dive. We just announced our next-generation of ARM-based infrastructure processors, our OCTEON TX2 family, targeting a wide variety of networking equipment, including switches, routers, secure gateways, firewalls, network monitoring, smartNICs and base stations. This portfolio delivers 2.5x performance improvement over the prior generation and can scale up to 200 gigabits per second of packet processing, scaling from 4 cores at the low end to 36 cores for the most demanding applications. \n Compared to solutions processing data only on CPU cores, OCTEON's configurable and programmable hardware accelerator blocks, which include security, packet processing, traffic management functions provide a much better balance between power and performance in networking applications. In fact, we have already started shipping production -- we started production shipments of our OCTEON TX2 processors into our lead wireless infrastructure customer. \n Our Ethernet switch and PHY products continue to win new designs in their target markets. As a reminder, our Ethernet switch strategy has been to expand beyond our enterprise campus position into the enterprise core and aggregation layers and into service providers. We play to our strengths in offering feature-rich products and do not target the pure speeds and feed sockets in the hyperscale data center market where there was already strong incumbency and a large networking OEM that announced their plan to offer internal ASICs directly to cloud customers. Our ARM server products and our automotive products also remain well positioned for growth later this year. \n Now let me discuss our projection for our networking business in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, as compared to fourth quarter results. Please keep in mind that our fourth quarter results included approximately 5 weeks of revenue from the now divested Wi-Fi business. Therefore, I'll first provide you with our revenue expectation for the continuing networking business, which we project to grow sequentially by approximately low single digits on a percentage basis from fourth quarter results adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi. We expect this growth to be led by new product ramps in enterprise and cloud data center applications while we project flattish revenue from the wireless infrastructure market. Please note that this growth outlook includes the negative impacts currently known from coronavirus-related issues. \n To help you clearly model this outlook, let me also provide you with the projection for first quarter results as compared to our reported fourth quarter networking revenue of $377 million, which included the 5 weeks of Wi-Fi. Compared to this reported result, we expect networking revenue in our first quarter to decline in the low to mid-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. \n Now let me turn to our storage business. Storage revenue for the fourth quarter was $296 million and grew 3% sequentially, stronger than our expectations. The sequential growth was driven by an increase in demand for both of our storage controller product lines. Specifically, our HDD business continued to benefit from our growing position in the nearline market and our enterprise and data center SSD business continued to recover in the fourth quarter. These data center-led growth drivers more than offset the expected decline in the client market. Our fiber channel business remains strong and stable from the third quarter. \n As you may recall, at our prior investor days in 2017 and then again in 2018, we had articulated a storage strategy to focus on the enterprise and data center market and become less reliant on the client market. \n In our HDD business, we projected the client business to secularly decline as the shift towards SSDs and PCs accelerated and that we plan to focus on the growing nearline market. In addition, we shifted investment in our SSD business towards higher performance and stickier enterprise and data center solutions and DIY opportunities and away from the commodity client market, where margins were less attractive, and some of our customers were increasingly in-sourcing controllers. At this point in time, we believe that the bulk of the decline in exposure to the client market, including the impact of client SSD controller in-sourcing at some customers, is mostly behind us. We estimate that our total client revenue exposure collectively across both HDD and SSD controllers, starting fiscal 2021, is only 5% of the entire company's revenue. For context, at our Investor Day in October 2018, client storage was approximately 14% of total company revenue. \n In fact, sequential storage revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was driven by our enterprise and data center products. The next phase of our storage growth strategy we had outlined was the emergence of the DIY market for custom SSD controllers, and we are now a couple of quarters away from mass production of our first major design win. \n We also expect to continue to ramp our preamplifiers for HDDs over the next couple of years. Our recently introduced 12-nanometer PCIe Gen 4 SSD controller continues to receive strong interest from multiple customers, including several NAND OEMs for its optimized blend of high-performance and low power in a small form factor. \n Our Ethernet-based storage solutions are gaining momentum, and we just announced we are partnering with leading ODMs, Accton and Foxconn to bring our Ethernet Bunch of Flash or EBOF technology solutions to market. As you may recall, at FMS 2019, we demonstrated our NVMe over Fabric Ethernet SSD controller. This product enables a disruptive new data center architecture by directly connecting SSDs through a switch to an Ethernet network, without the need to go through a host, such as a server. These EBOF platforms will start sampling the spring and incorporate Marvell's NVMe over Fabric SSD controllers, Prestera Ethernet switches and up to 48 SSDs in a single chassis. \n In aggregate, we believe the growing footprint of our enterprise and data center storage controllers and preamps, upcoming ramp of our SSD DIY controllers and progress of our Ethernet-based storage initiatives, collectively positions our storage business for long-term success. Looking to the first quarter for our storage business, which is generally a seasonally down quarter for this end market, coupled with virus-related impacts to this business, we expect revenue to decline sequentially in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis. \n Let me close by thanking the more than 5,500 Marvell employees around the world for executing extremely well under difficult macroeconomic conditions. I am looking forward to an exciting fiscal 2021 to capitalize on the multiple growth initiatives we have been investing in over the last few years. Fiscal 2021 also marks an important milestone for Marvell, as we celebrate our 25th year anniversary. It has been a long and eventful journey, most recently punctuated with the company's transformation as we pivoted towards the infrastructure market. The financial community has been well aware of our journey, and we have now started to share our story with a broader audience. We held our first industry Analyst Day in early December, and the reception was outstanding. We received clear feedback that our story needs to be told more broadly as they see Marvell in the midst of multiple major trends, including 5G, AI, cloud and connected autos. \n We will continue to spread the message and are scheduling our next Investor Day for October 6 in New York, where we will provide an update on our progress towards our long-term goals. I look forward to seeing many of you at that event. \n And with that, I will turn over the call to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. \nJean Hu: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, our guidance for the fourth quarter provided on December 3, 2019 assumed full quarter of results from the Wi-Fi business. Subsequently, we completed divestiture of our Wi-Fi business on December 6, approximately 5 weeks into the fourth quarter. So our results reflect the partial quarter contributions from the Wi-Fi business. We then updated only our revenue guidance to reflect the closing of the Wi-Fi sale. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $718 million, better than our updated guidance of $710 million at the middle point. Networking represented 52% of our revenue in the fourth quarter and the storage contributing 41%. Revenue from our other business was $44 million in the fourth quarter below expectations and accounted for 7% of our revenue. \n As a reminder, this business consist of products such as the printer solutions and application processes, we have stopped investing, so they will continue to decline over time. In fact, our guidance for the first quarter for fiscal 2021 anticipate sequential decline in revenue in the high teens on a percentage basis from the other business. GAAP gross margin was 42.5%, which included the amortization of both Aquantia and Avera inventory step-up cost. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.3% of revenue. Our gross margin results in the fourth quarter reflect the negative impact from certain onetime transition costs related to the Avera acquisition, as we discussed last quarter. \n GAAP operating expenses were $419 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $306 million. GAAP operating loss was $114 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $141 million or 19.6% of revenue. During the quarter, to better align the global economic ownership of our intellectual property rights with our current and future business operations, we transferred certain intellectual property to our subsidiary in Singapore. This internal IP transfer resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $763 million for the fourth quarter, which primarily capture the tax effect for future deductions in Singapore. \n In addition, the change in the tax structure will result in a small 50 basis point increase to our non-GAAP tax rate from 4.5% to 5%. For the fourth quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $2.62, which included a gain from the sale of the Wi-Fi business and the income tax benefits related to the IP transfer. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.17. \n Now turning to our balance sheet. Our long-term debt was $1.45 billion, declining from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we completed divestiture of Wi-Fi business and used the sale proceeds to payoff the $600 million bridge loan we entered into in connection with the Avera acquisition. And also, we paid off $350 million revolver we drawn to fund the Aquantia acquisition as well as $250 million of our term loan. We also resumed our share repurchase program and returned $340 million to shareholders through $300 million in share repurchases and $40 million in dividends. \n In fiscal 2020, we returned a total of $524 million in cash to shareholders. We exit the quarter with $648 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $209 million from the prior quarter. \n Now moving on to our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Please note, we have built into the guidance a 5% reduction in revenue due to the risks associated with the coronavirus. Although the situation remains fluid, and the ultimate impact is still unknown and assessing the magnitude at this point is not feasible. Given the ongoing uncertainty, we have also temporarily widened the guidance range on revenue. Specifically, we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $680 million, plus or minus 5%. We anticipate our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 47.5%, and the non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 63%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $410 million, plus or minus $3 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $310 million plus or minus $2.5 million. The sequential seasonal increase in payroll taxes and the reset of bonus accruals have been significantly offset by early than expected synergy achievement and the disciplined OpEx management. \n From this high point in the fiscal year, we continue to expect our non-GAAP operating expenses will come down to approximately $300 million by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. We expect net interest expenses to be approximately $16 million and expect non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. As a result, we anticipate a GAAP loss per diluted share in the range of $0.12 to $0.20 and the non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.11 to $0.17. \n Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Atif Malik from Citi. [Operator Instructions] \nAtif Malik: A nice job on the results and guide. And congratulations on the expanded Nokia relationship. Matt, the team has talked about $750 million pipeline of site 5G infrastructure sales; $600 million across Samsung, Nokia and then $150 million from Avera, about 20% of the $4 billion opportunity. Can you just talk about with the new expanded Nokia relationship and then the Samsung collaboration, how is the team tracking to those numbers? \nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Great. Thanks, Atif. Yes, I think you got it exactly right. Just for everybody on the phone, we started off with a base case that we outlined pre-Avera, which was $600 million, which included the pipeline that we had identified of one business at that point. We successfully closed Avera, which brought in numbers in that approximate range you mentioned about roughly half of that business was 5G exposed. And so the way I would think about it is that the announcements that you've seen clearly add additional revenue on top of that. I think what we're excited about is, we really have now multiple customers for our 5G solutions, multiple products that we're selling to those customers, and that actually layer in over multiple generations, including existing business we're shipping today, new product ramps happening this year. And then as you referenced, even on our announcement with Nokia, a multigenerational agreement where we have products ramping later this year, but then even ongoing partnership to do more in the coming years on a spectrum of products. \n So I think, overall, it's very positive and clearly represents the announcements we've made, certainly a substantially higher number to what we've already communicated. \nAtif Malik: And as a follow-up, Jean, the 5% reduction from the virus, can you just talk about storage versus networking? Is it more storage-related than networking? \nJean Hu: Yes. So very high level, a lot of things are unknown. So our estimate right now is more like 40% is related to storage side, 60% is related to networking side. Matt can give you more color on the networking side. We have some part of business, which there's a component shortage that impacted our networking business. And storage side, a similar thing. Our customers, they have some supply chain disruption, so that's what we know right now. \nMatthew Murphy: Yes. I think, just to conclude, we've tried to size the impact as best we can. And as Jean mentioned, from our side, there's really 2 types of supply chain disruptions: There's disruption to some of our products, which are -- the bulk of the products that we ship every quarter are integrated circuits, but we do have some board business, both in Ethernet NICs and host bus adapters for fiber channel as well as some of the board-level products for smartNICs. And so even though our supplier base is actually outside of China and some of the impacted regions, they're having some challenges in sourcing some of the components. So that's one dynamic we see, but we're working through that. And then the second is, obviously, many of our end customers, factories or subcons are not at full capacity. So it's a fluid situation. But right now, what we're sizing is really what we see as supply chain-related impacts, both to us as well as our customers. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. \nVivek Arya: Matt, my first question is on 5G. So the opportunity on the base station side, I think, has been clear, and you've articulated that very well. I wanted to ask on the radio side. What's the opportunity to leverage this kind of beachhead you have with Avera? And I think recently, you also announced a partnership with Analog Devices for some integrated radio solutions, and there's obviously a lot more radios, heightened complexity on that side and perhaps the chance to displace more FPGAs. So talk to us about the radio opportunity for Marvell in 5G. \nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Thanks. And I think we very much see our opportunity. It's both in the base station or the base BBU as well as the radio head, and we started to indicate that in the last few calls and even in some of my comments today, where, as an example, with Samsung, we're doing some very customized things with them in the radio head itself, which is really bringing our processing capability up from the base station unit into the radio head. And on top of that, so you sort of pick up, one trend is being processing power, processing, compute, moving up closer to the antenna. But the second is that, at least in some of the initial deployments of 5G, Korea was one example, but there's others. There's quite a high-density of massive MIMO radio heads attached to each base station. And so you sort of think about the idea that there's more processing power moving to the radio head, and then there's more radio heads attached per base station. It does create a significant opportunity. And that's a trend, by the way, that we see more broadly and not just is limited to one customer. So I think that's certainly exciting. \n I think the second is with respect to Analog Devices, we're sort of seeing each other now in these types of applications, starting with our DFE business that we have, but also in some of these applications where we're being asked to do more customized things in massive MIMO. And if you think about the architecture, where they have one of the leading positions, obviously, in the RF transceiver market and data converter market and us having a very strong position in the DFE, which is basically the digital chip that interfaces with the analog and mixed-signal functions. The coupling of those 2 is becoming even more and more important and so how do -- there's questions from how do we do things like co-packaging products together? How do we align on what the most ideal interfaces are for the chips to communicate with each other? What are the best architectures that we can pursue? And since the 2 companies are extremely complementary in their offerings, we see it as a great opportunity to actually innovate together and provide optimized solutions for our customers who really want to differentiate their products. And so the ADI team has got tremendous experience in this area. We, obviously, have a very experienced team of architects and technologists. And so really, the basis of the collaboration is to be able to address customers jointly and do that in a coordinated manner. So that's what we're doing. So I think the bottom line is we're as excited about the radio head opportunities as we are in the rest of the entire base station system. \nVivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, Matt, thanks for the color on the storage side. I think you mentioned client is now only about 5% of that business. I forgot whether you mentioned it just for storage or of the entire company. But my question really is, what is the right way to think about your storage business on a 2- to 3-year basis. Is it still kind of a flattish business? Is it a low single-digit growth business? What is the right conceptual way to think about the storage business for Marvell? \nMatthew Murphy: Yes. So yes, just to clarify. So yes, I was pretty explicit, but I'll say it again. The 5% number I gave you was for entire company. And so -- and for those of you who that have followed us from the beginning of our journey, I mean, I don't know exactly what this number was, Jean, but it was probably 30%, 40% of company back in 2016, so we've really worked on this one. And certainly, 2019 probably accelerated some of this transition that we already saw happening. So as we look forward, I think a couple of things: One is, we're very excited about our growth drivers. We did pivot the engineering 2 or 3 years ago to this nearline and enterprise-type of market for cloud capacity. I think there's a view that, that's going to continue to grow in terms of demand for those types of drives and we've increased our position both on the controller side as well as the addition of preamps. So that's a nice growth driver for us. The second is in SSD, as we've made the pivot from sort of supplying commodity client controllers to NAND OEMs to doing very sophisticated products that are doing things like Ethernet-attached storage or and, certainly, this trend of this do-it-yourself model, where we partner directly with the end OEM to define really an SSD, SOC, if you will. That trend is going very well and that we expect revenue growth from that. And so there's a number of exciting growth initiatives. And so I think, although a lot of the decline in client has occurred, clearly, on the HDD side, there will still be more to go as PCs transition. So the way we think about this business is we do think about it as certainly looking forward, given the exposure we have to client, it's something that can grow, it would be very modest. And we think keeping this in the low single-digit range is a very achievable goal. And given the strategic nature of this business to Marvell and the profitability profile, it's -- I think we got the right balance of investment and growth for this particular segment of our company. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. \nTore Svanberg: Yes. Congratulations on the strong results. First of all, coming back to the radio head opportunity. Obviously, it depends a lot on the kind of MIMO architecture, but should we think of content here kind of being in the several hundred dollars range? If you could just add some color there, that would be great. \nMatthew Murphy: Well, look, I think, as was indicated in the prior questions, we do have a footprint today in radio head in a number of the applications. Some of those are from DFE or some of those are -- or actually, we indicated this also that certain customers have started using our fusion-based products to do massive MIMO processing while transitioning to more customized solutions. So those are there, and you should assume that these are large, advanced node digital chips. And so we're not calling out ASP specifically, but they're clearly high ASP devices in that, I don't know, call it, $100-ish plus range, and you can go -- you can sort of go multiples of that depending on the complexity and how many units, et cetera. So yes, these are normal large digital chips. And then, obviously, I know from your past, you're quite -- even today, you're still very knowledgeable about the analog market. So I think you know what that TAM looks like. And I think you also understand the interdependencies of the 2 and how critical that is to system design. So yes, it's really about the 2 companies working together and helping pull each other into mutually beneficial opportunities where we can work together. But yes, as far as ASPs goes, they're bigger digital chips. \nTore Svanberg: Very good. And as my follow-up, you've talked in the past about the programmable approach really creating a lot of stickiness for you in your design wins, as we look at these next partnerships that you've announced, especially the additional one with Samsung and also with Nokia, should we think about that, that stickiness still prevailing in a pretty meaningful way? \nMatthew Murphy: Very much so, and I would argue that was one of the key technical value props that we've been able to deliver. I think if you sort of think about this OCTEON-based architecture based on ARM present at all hops within the base station, whether it's massive MIMO processing in the radio head, whether it's the transport processing for layer 2, whether it's the baseband processing, it's very efficient when a customer actually goes all in with us. And certainly, these designs by nature are quite sticky because these base station designs are quite complex. It's not a second source business. Once you get in, they last a long time. But clearly, that's one of the key differentiators that our processor team has delivered consistently for 5 generations now of product. So that's absolutely how you should think about it. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. \nBlayne Curtis: Nice result. I'm just kind of curious, a lot of questions on 5G. Maybe in networking and everything, but 5G, just curious an update on kind of the enterprise channel and that business returning to sequential and year-over-year growth, do you have any thoughts on the -- for the rest of the year? \nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Yes, no, thanks. And I think -- thanks, Blayne. So in 2019 and certainly in the midst of the dynamics around the trade war, we saw a number of the enterprise OEMs, our customers get whipped around a little bit. And we certainly felt that in our results in a couple of different quarters. We were certainly encouraged after the signing of the Phase I deal that things seem to stabilize. And in fact, we had very strong order momentum, certainly, and bookings momentum in Q4. I think as that situation stabilized and we started to see a very strong recovery in our core business, which I think, as you know, is a very healthy business for us, and it's one that, prior to the trade war, we had actually been growing at a pretty significant rate. I think we had 6 quarters of double-digit growth in that business before we had the pause in 2019. So we were encouraged to see that return to growth, which was more of a, I call it a, restabilizing, but also actually growth. And then certainly, understanding now we're dealing with the coronavirus situation, but it certainly hasn't diminished at all our longer-term outlook, especially as we look through later this year with continued new product ramps. And what we brought in Aquantia, as an example, we paired up their multi-gate technology with our Prestera switches. We see multi-gig is a very clear trend that's happening. Our design win position has been very good there. We've actually brought in new customers, both on the PHY and the switch side in the last few years, which we believe will start bearing fruit. \n And then finally, what's embedded today in our networking number is also our automotive business, which is our automotive Ethernet. And while those are still smaller numbers today on a relative basis, they're growing every quarter and they're incrementally adding revenue, and we anticipate seeing acceleration in that business as we exit calendar '20, heading into model year '21 where a number of the vehicles we were designed into going back 1 and 2 years ago will start to ramp. So we actually have -- I'm glad you asked the networking question because it's a very large and important part of our business with some very exciting growth drivers to, I think, complement our also equally exciting 5G opportunities. So I think both of those are still in front of us. \nBlayne Curtis: And then just maybe a quick one for Jean. It looks like you did a combination of buybacks and retiring debt. Just how are you thinking about use of cash? And are you going to retire any more debt going forward? Any help there will be great. \nJean Hu: Yes. I think, certainly, our number one objective is to invest in the business after we close all 3 acquisitions -- 2 acquisitions and 1 divestiture. Right now, we really shifted our focus to return excess cash to shareholders through buyback. Of course, we are very focused on our investment-grade rating, but we think we can generate sufficient cash flow to do both. So priority is to return cash to shareholders and then we'll return -- pay down the debt over time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. \nRoss Seymore: Congrats, especially, on the guide. Going back to the 5G side of things, Matt, maybe a clarification before a question. The Nokia announcement from today there's been a lot of investors debating whether that's just a formalization of the formerly unnamed second customer or an expansion. And I guess the question is, if it is the latter side in an expansion, can you just go a little bit into what's the incremental aspect to it? And forgive me if you captured that in your 5G discussion earlier. \nMatthew Murphy: Yes, got it, Ross, and that's not a problem to clarify on Nokia. So first, we're obviously thrilled to have a public announcement about something like this. It clearly makes it a little bit easier to talk about this. And what I would say is, we've had a very good experience in the partnership so far with Nokia. We're very impressed by the team. And I think together, we've really executed well on this first product. And so as you think about what this means, what I would say is kind of 2 things: One is, I would think of it as a broadening of the opportunity and the relationship on the existing program we have, which means, obviously, multiple generation and then broadening our exposure within their products. And then, what the announcement also references is partnering around embedded processing and multi-core -- with our multi-core OCTEON family. So it's really a broadening of one and expansion as well. So we're -- it's a big deal for us. We're fully committed to execute with them to make them successful. And we think it's a great validation of the strategy we put in place a few years ago and the investments we've made. It's very rewarding to see this. We still have a lot of hard work in front of us because these are extremely complex chips and extremely demanding applications, but we're honored to be working with them and, certainly, to have an expanded opportunity set with them is a very good thing. \nRoss Seymore: Thanks a ton for that clarification. And then my follow-up would be one for Jean and it would be on the gross margin side of things. You're very helpful on the OpEx side talking about where that would end the fiscal year. Tons of puts and takes on mix businesses that you sold coming out, et cetera. On the gross margin side of things, how do you think about that progressing over time, especially as the mix of the wireless infrastructure side seemingly would grow as a percentage of the company? \nJean Hu: Yes, Ross, thanks for the question. I think to just take it from a very high level, right? If you go back to Q3 fiscal '20, our gross margin was 63.5%, which included Wi-Fi, but not Avera. Then, of course, at that time, the revenue is at almost the trough of the company's revenue level. So our gross margin, if we think about is 2 factors: one is product mix; one is revenue level. Once we close all the transaction, when you look at both Aquantia, Avera and also the Wi-Fi business, the way to think about it is Avera and the Wi-Fi business, they have a very similar financial profile, right? Revenue level, gross margins around 50%. I would say right now that's the major product mix driver for the near term is, when you think about these -- our gross margin should be go back to 63% to 64% level. Going forward, we actually are quite confident about sustaining our strong gross margin, especially with wireless infrastructure side because fundamentally, right, gross margin is a reflection of the IP value you provide to customers and we have a very unique value proposition to our customers across all our product lines and platforms. So once the revenue level is going up, we also get leverage from the revenue level of the company. So overall, of course, we think in the near term, it's going to be 63% to 64%. But in the longer term, we are quite confident about sustaining strong gross margin going forward. \nMatthew Murphy: Yes and, maybe I'll just add, I think that was captured to Jean, but I would just add, with respect to Avera, there's a couple of additional things to point out. I think one is the team is laser-focused on that particular segment. And we even highlighted it last quarter that there were some margin-related transition impact when we brought the business over. So there's a lot of specific work going on to improve that gross margin. What I would say, just to add to what Jean said on the relative trade we made between Avera and Wi-Fi, while the revenue levels, you call them similar, and margins were similar from a gross margin standpoint, the operating margin profile is quite different because with -- and that's something that we consciously got our heads around. And we're okay with Avera and the nature of that business comes with NRE funding for the projects, which offsets R&D. So it's a fundamentally higher operating margin business. And I would say, on top of that, it addresses a much larger SAM than we were going after with Wi-Fi, and we think that business has a much higher potential to grow in line with the company over time. And so yes, that was just my few extra comments on Avera. \nJean Hu: Yes. Our long-term objective, of course, is to drive profitable growth, right, and margin pool expansion in the longer term. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo Securities. \nGary Mobley: Wanted to go back to the Nokia topic and delve a little bit deeper into Ross' question. When you're sizing up the opportunity for 5G you're roughly citing $600 million in potential peak opportunity, I think what perhaps was underpinning the Nokia assumption was that you will split that ASIC business and their implementation in the ReefShark architecture 3 ways, maybe 2 other ASIC suppliers as well. The way I read today's press release is that maybe you have some exclusivity with Nokia and perhaps better-than-expected market share at Nokia. Am I reading that correctly? \nMatthew Murphy: I think the right way to read it is kind of for what it says, which is the companies have entered into a multi-generation, multi-product collaboration and partnership, where we're going to be working together. We think, as I said earlier, we think that's good for Marvell. We think that's going to mean more business for us over time, if we execute and prove ourselves, then we think it's good for them because of the nature of the solutions we're providing. So I mean, if you think about -- as more and more of Nokia's business shifts to 5G and that becomes more important for them and, certainly, we hope to be part of the equation and helping them achieve their goals, we'll then benefit from the content gain that we have. And so I think that's the best way to think about it is, it's an extended relationship. There's new products we're working on. Teams are working really well together. This is a multiyear thing. And certainly, as 5G takes off for the industry and for Nokia, we'll -- we should be a big beneficiary of that with this rollout. \nGary Mobley: For my follow-up, I don't think there was any mention about ThunderX2 in the prepared remarks or in the Q&A. So maybe you can just give us an update on where you stand with respect to timing and perhaps magnitude of your first big marquee design win there for ThunderX2? \nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Yes. No, it was -- I did have in my prepared remarks, but these were a little bit longer than normal just given all the challenges with corona and the various 5G things. So I apologize for that, but it was in there. What we said was that we -- our ARM server program was on track to ramp in the second half, as we've been indicating before. So we didn't really have a big change there. I think it's pretty consistent with what we've been saying so far. And I think that's the only update I've got on that, that program will -- we continue to work closely with the lead customer, and we're hoping that they ramp us in the second half. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Nice job on the quarterly execution. As NAND storage kind of finds its way into new applications such as gaming, I think, you guys have good exposure to this upcoming game console refresh cycle, partnered up with one of the leading SSD suppliers. Does the ramp for you here on the SSD controller side start here in the April quarter? Or is it more likely the July quarter? And if you can just give us some color on the performance differentiators that enabled you to win with your controller solution for this high-volume design win? \nMatthew Murphy: Yes, Harlan, I think the way I think about it is, you're right. I think NAND flash is very much making its way into new use cases and it's replacing conventional or traditional storage media. And certainly, that is one example that you mentioned. I think all we've said so far is we think that, that transition in that market is going to be positive for Marvell. We -- and I think that's probably it. As you can imagine, there's -- on that particular market, there's sort of tremendous confidentiality and sensitivity around that. So all I'd say is net-net, in that particular transition, I think that -- I know Marvell will do. It will be a net positive for Marvell. \nHarlan Sur: Absolutely. And then on the networking side, on the strength of the networking business outside of 5G, specifically on the service side, your lead customer partner here, Intel has seen strong growth in their server business into data centers. And I believe that Aquantia had a strong partnership with Intel on the service side. And I think that core Marvell side, you guys also have some strong PHY and NIC partnerships with Intel as well on servers. Is this server exposure, driving some of the networking strength here in the April quarter, just given the strong demand outlook for this part of the market? \nMatthew Murphy: Yes. I think you're right. We've -- both companies Aquantia and Marvell have been -- had partnerships with Intel for some time. And what I would say is that the networking strength that we saw with bookings in Q4 and certainly our Q1 outlook was broad-based, but I would say for sure that the dynamics you mentioned, and that the server recovery and growth was quite strong, and that's certainly benefiting those particular businesses for us, both the Aquantia piece as well as us on the NIC side. \nOperator: Our final question for today comes from the line of John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nJohn Pitzer: Thanks for sneaking me in. Matt, I guess my first question is just on the radio opportunity. I'm just kind of curious, how do we think about kind of the timing to sort of meaningful revenue? And you guys have been doing stuff pre to collaboration with ADI or at least the announcement. Is the ADI stuff later on as we think about the radio opportunity? And of the $750 million kind of outlined for 5G, how do we think base station versus radio head? And then I have a follow-up. \nMatthew Murphy: Yes, I think the way to think about it is the announcement with ADI was really a desire for us to just make the market aware, all the stakeholders in the ecosystem, that the 2 companies, the teams were working together. We are already sort of jointly getting pulled into things, so I wouldn't sort of tie an ADI engagement to a new design win per se. I would say that we're pursuing opportunities, they're pursuing opportunities. We tend to show up in the same place. So this is a way for us to add value to our customers. But as I mentioned, as far as silicon for radio head, we have Fusion-based processors, right, that are shipping today. We have next-generation parts, which we've done a bunch of customization on with our customer IP. We see that trend continuing. We also have digital front-end ASIC-related content. So there's actually quite a bit that's going on there. So I would just think of it as an ongoing trend that we will see both growth in the digital unit as well as the radio heads. And to the extent that massive MIMO influx, and it becomes a major trend globally, and you think about the out years as our content grows both in the DUs and the radio heads, we think it just adds to the opportunity for Marvell. Certainly, more attach of massive MIMO means more capacity, more users, more silicon and more chips, and that's all the positive for us. So I don't think we have a split right now of like how do we think about how much is in where. And quite frankly, those lines, John, are blurring because a lot of the new standards from 3GPP in terms of the splits and where does the processing and the files actually sit, in what part of the network, in what part of the base station unit, it's fairly dynamic. And they have things like O-RAN coming, which is also defining a new way of doing processing. So a lot of diversity in the applications. We think we're well suited for all of them. But probably more to come on that as we go forward with our different engagements we're pursuing. \nJohn Pitzer: That's helpful. And then, just to have my follow-up, I want to go back to kind of your guidance around the coronavirus and caveat it by saying, I appreciate the fact it's very fluid and any question I ask is going to be best guess. But I just want to make sure I understand the 5% cushion in the April quarter is what you've already seen. The wider range is the uncertainty and you've characterized it as more of a supply issue than a demand issue, and a lot of your peers have as well. I'm just curious it feels like the peak of the supply disruption was right after Chinese New Year, and week on week things are getting better. Is that not putting words in your mouth? Is that how you would sort of describe the situation to date? \nMatthew Murphy: Yes, great. Let me take in 2 pieces. So I think the first is you got it right. So the -- and again, sorry for so many 5s. So the first 5% number was our estimate of how much we -- now that we've guided to $680 million, we basically backed that down about 5% from where we were prior to corona hitting, where we saw Q4 -- sorry, Q1 lining up. So we did that in a fairly detailed way, just looking at the bridge from where we were to where we're guiding and the moving pieces. And as you mentioned, today they're all supply chain-related. We have really no way to know if there's been any demand disruption? Where it would occur? What's actually happening? I think that's to come. Certainly -- and then on the -- by the way, on the plus or minus 5%, that's independent. That's just saying, hey, at the midpoint, we normally guide plus or minus 3%. Given just how volatile this thing is, we don't know does it come back? Does this thing become more of a nonissue? There's a couple of them quite serious, even more serious today. So that's why we widened the range. And so yes, I think I just conclude by saying, I read the same probably reports you do, and we certainly see the activity that says factories are gradually coming back online. People in China are gradually going back to work. But we don't really know what the ripple effect is to the global economy candidly from this disruption. So we just don't know. And so that's why I think probably ourselves and peers are not hesitant to call the demand change. We just don't know. And so I think that's what's going to probably play itself out here over the coming quarter. \nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Ashish Saran for any further remarks. \nAshish Saran: Thank you, everyone, for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with you next quarter. \nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. As a reminder, our guidance for the fourth quarter provided on December 3, 2019 assumed full quarter of results from the Wi-Fi business. Subsequently, we completed divestiture of our Wi-Fi business on December 6, approximately 5 weeks into the fourth quarter. So our results reflect the partial quarter contributions from the Wi-Fi business. We then updated only our revenue guidance to reflect the closing of the Wi-Fi sale. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $718 million, better than our updated guidance of $710 million at the middle point. Networking represented 52% of our revenue in the fourth quarter and the storage contributing 41%. Revenue from our other business was $44 million in the fourth quarter below expectations and accounted for 7% of our revenue. \n As a reminder, this business consist of products such as the printer solutions and application processes, we have stopped investing, so they will continue to decline over time. In fact, our guidance for the first quarter for fiscal 2021 anticipate sequential decline in revenue in the high teens on a percentage basis from the other business. GAAP gross margin was 42.5%, which included the amortization of both Aquantia and Avera inventory step-up cost. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.3% of revenue. Our gross margin results in the fourth quarter reflect the negative impact from certain onetime transition costs related to the Avera acquisition, as we discussed last quarter. \n GAAP operating expenses were $419 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $306 million. GAAP operating loss was $114 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $141 million or 19.6% of revenue. During the quarter, to better align the global economic ownership of our intellectual property rights with our current and future business operations, we transferred certain intellectual property to our subsidiary in Singapore. This internal IP transfer resulted in an income tax benefit of approximately $763 million for the fourth quarter, which primarily capture the tax effect for future deductions in Singapore. \n In addition, the change in the tax structure will result in a small 50 basis point increase to our non-GAAP tax rate from 4.5% to 5%. For the fourth quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $2.62, which included a gain from the sale of the Wi-Fi business and the income tax benefits related to the IP transfer. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.17. \n Now turning to our balance sheet. Our long-term debt was $1.45 billion, declining from the prior quarter. During the quarter, we completed divestiture of Wi-Fi business and used the sale proceeds to payoff the $600 million bridge loan we entered into in connection with the Avera acquisition. And also, we paid off $350 million revolver we drawn to fund the Aquantia acquisition as well as $250 million of our term loan. We also resumed our share repurchase program and returned $340 million to shareholders through $300 million in share repurchases and $40 million in dividends. \n In fiscal 2020, we returned a total of $524 million in cash to shareholders. We exit the quarter with $648 million in cash and cash equivalents, an increase of $209 million from the prior quarter. \n Now moving on to our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Please note, we have built into the guidance a 5% reduction in revenue due to the risks associated with the coronavirus. Although the situation remains fluid, and the ultimate impact is still unknown and assessing the magnitude at this point is not feasible. Given the ongoing uncertainty, we have also temporarily widened the guidance range on revenue. Specifically, we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $680 million, plus or minus 5%. We anticipate our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 47.5%, and the non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 63%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $410 million, plus or minus $3 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $310 million plus or minus $2.5 million. The sequential seasonal increase in payroll taxes and the reset of bonus accruals have been significantly offset by early than expected synergy achievement and the disciplined OpEx management. \n From this high point in the fiscal year, we continue to expect our non-GAAP operating expenses will come down to approximately $300 million by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. We expect net interest expenses to be approximately $16 million and expect non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. As a result, we anticipate a GAAP loss per diluted share in the range of $0.12 to $0.20 and the non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.11 to $0.17. \n Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Yes. So very high level, a lot of things are unknown. So our estimate right now is more like 40% is related to storage side, 60% is related to networking side. Matt can give you more color on the networking side. We have some part of business, which there's a component shortage that impacted our networking business. And storage side, a similar thing. Our customers, they have some supply chain disruption, so that's what we know right now. Yes. I think, certainly, our number one objective is to invest in the business after we close all 3 acquisitions -- 2 acquisitions and 1 divestiture. Right now, we really shifted our focus to return excess cash to shareholders through buyback. Of course, we are very focused on our investment-grade rating, but we think we can generate sufficient cash flow to do both. So priority is to return cash to shareholders and then we'll return -- pay down the debt over time. Yes, Ross, thanks for the question. I think to just take it from a very high level, right? If you go back to Q3 fiscal '20, our gross margin was 63.5%, which included Wi-Fi, but not Avera. Then, of course, at that time, the revenue is at almost the trough of the company's revenue level. So our gross margin, if we think about is 2 factors: one is product mix; one is revenue level. Once we close all the transaction, when you look at both Aquantia, Avera and also the Wi-Fi business, the way to think about it is Avera and the Wi-Fi business, they have a very similar financial profile, right? Revenue level, gross margins around 50%. I would say right now that's the major product mix driver for the near term is, when you think about these -- our gross margin should be go back to 63% to 64% level. Going forward, we actually are quite confident about sustaining our strong gross margin, especially with wireless infrastructure side because fundamentally, right, gross margin is a reflection of the IP value you provide to customers and we have a very unique value proposition to our customers across all our product lines and platforms. So once the revenue level is going up, we also get leverage from the revenue level of the company. So overall, of course, we think in the near term, it's going to be 63% to 64%. But in the longer term, we are quite confident about sustaining strong gross margin going forward. Yes. Our long-term objective, of course, is to drive profitable growth, right, and margin pool expansion in the longer term."

            "name": "Matthew Murphy",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a quick recap of Marvell's financial highlights for fiscal year 2020. Our GAAP revenue was $2.7 billion, GAAP gross margin was 50.3%, and GAAP income per diluted share was $2.34. On a non-GAAP basis, our gross margin was 63.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.66. Fiscal 2020 was clearly a challenging year for the semiconductor industry. But against this backdrop of macroeconomic uncertainty, Marvell continues to take bold steps towards becoming a leader in infrastructure solutions. Not only did we achieve the complete realization of synergies from the integration of Cavium in the first quarter of fiscal 2020, 2 quarters ahead of schedule, we announced and closed 3 additional strategic transactions within the year. We acquired Aquantia and Avera and divested our Wi-Fi business. In fact, the integration of Aquantia and Avera is well ahead of plan and this is reflected in our lower OpEx expectations for the first quarter of fiscal 2021, which Jean will discuss in her section. Implementing all the key learnings from the Cavium acquisition, our IT and operations team did an amazing job in completing the ERP integration of Aquantia in 1 day and Avera within 5 days of closing the transactions. \n In addition to the portfolio transformation, we won a number of key designs in fiscal 2020, which we expect will fuel multiple years of revenue growth for the company. In wireless infrastructure, we started ramping our first-generation of 5G processors at Samsung, won their next-generation 5G baseband processor; and yesterday, we announced an even deeper collaboration with them. During the last year, we also won a fronthaul interface chip and entered into the radio head with processors from massive MIMO. \n Equally exciting, earlier today, Nokia announced an expanded relationship with Marvell on 5G infrastructure solutions, which I will discuss later in the call. \n In Ethernet connectivity, we won a number of designs at leading networking OEMs with our switch and PHY solutions. In storage, we started to ship and ramp preamps and controllers into high capacity 16-terabyte near line drives and secured the follow-on controller for the next-generation platform, targeting higher capacity points, well into the 20-plus terabyte range. \n We released our NVMe over Fabric Ethernet SSD controller and a family of PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD controllers, which are also powering our first major DIY win. As we start fiscal 2021, we are excited about a number of product ramps, but are also trying to assess the near-term impact from the coronavirus. \n Clearly, the safety and well-being of our employees is our highest concern, and I want to express my sincere support for all our people in China who have been the most impacted. Prior to the outbreak gaining intensity, our bookings and backlog were getting stronger going into fiscal year 2021, driven by our own product cycles, such as the start of our 5G product ramp, our success in nearline drives and a recovery in our core business. In addition, the signing of the Phase 1 trade deal between the U.S. and China was helpful in erasing trade tensions, which had affected our business last year. But recently, as the virus impact has become broader, we have started to see supply chain-related impacts to our business. \n It is impossible for us to fully quantify the effect of the situation as our business -- on our business as it remains fluid. However, our revenue guidance for the first quarter includes a 5% reduction based on what we know so far. In addition, given the ongoing uncertainty, we have also temporarily widened our guidance range on revenue from plus or minus 3% to plus or minus 5%. \n Let's move on to our quarterly performance. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered solid results and achieved $718 million in revenue, above the midpoint of the revised guidance we had provided on December 6, after we completed the divestiture of our Wi-Fi business. Our GAAP income per share was $2.62, and our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.17. \n First, in our networking business, revenue during the quarter was $377 million and grew 14% sequentially. The double-digit growth was primarily due to full quarter contributions from the Avera and Aquantia acquisitions, partially offset by the divestiture of Wi-Fi. Both of our recent acquisitions were off to a running start with the Avera ASIC business delivering a solid quarter, and Aquantia's revenue trajectory continuing to improve as those customers completed inventory digestion. The bookings trends for both of these acquisitions support the full year expectations we had communicated last year. \n While the Avera design team continues to work on completing designs they had won prior to the acquisition, they are also engaging with existing Marvell customers who had not worked with them in recent years. The overall opportunity pipeline for Avera is very healthy and continues to broaden. Outside of the 2 acquisitions, wireless infrastructure shipments remain strong and enterprise performed as expected. In addition, we experienced strong booking trends in networking before the recent coronavirus impact clouded the outlook. While we assess the impact from this event, we continue to make progress on securing additional design wins in a number of key end markets. \n I'll start with the wireless infrastructure market. Yesterday, we announced an extension of our long-term collaboration with Samsung across additional segments of the radio access network. We have been working with Samsung closely to deliver multiple generations of baseband and Control Plane solutions for both 4G and now 5G base stations, incorporating their intellectual property with Marvell's OCTEON and Fusion processors. More recently, we have also been partnering with them on innovative radio unit architectures designed to meet the dramatic increase in compute power required for the complex beamforming algorithms inherent to massive MIMO deployments. \n Equally exciting, earlier today, Nokia announced that we are broadening our relationship for the development of multiple generations of custom and multi-core ARM-based infrastructure processors for 5G. This is another example of the partnership model we offer, which enables our customers such as Nokia to integrate their unique technology into our programmable processor platform to develop customized products. It's really the best of both worlds, as our customers can focus their internal resources on their differentiated technology and embed that IP into the chipset. This significantly accelerates their time-to-market by utilizing other parts of the SoC subsystem from Marvell, such as the processor complex, which we have already developed and hardened for base stations. \n We are able to deliver this degree of customization with our field-proven, flexible SoC architecture in our Fusion products comprised of ARM cores, a variety of DSP cores tailored to our customers' requirements and customer developed IP blocks stitched together very efficiently by our unique interconnect to maximize performance. This programming model enables our customers to differentiate their solutions to their own IP and algorithms. In addition to providing the underlying architecture for our customized Fusion solutions, our OCTEON multi-core ARM-based infrastructure processors also provide control and data plane processing. \n We are looking forward to growing our business with Nokia as they benefit from the growing 5G wireless infrastructure market. We expect to start shipping the first custom product later this fiscal year, and we are also starting development of the next-generation of infrastructure processors and custom SoCs. In addition to the progress we are making at multiple Tier 1 wireless customers with our existing platforms, we are continuing to innovate in this market and are working with analog devices to pair their world-class RF transceiver technology with our broad digital 5G platform. \n We both recognized the growing complexity in 5G radio units with the proliferation of technologies, such as massive MIMO, which is driving an increased need for the very close collaboration between the RF and mixed-signal portion with the compute domain. This unique collaboration between the 2 best-of-breed suppliers will provide customers with significant improvements in size, power and performance within the increasingly complex radio unit. \n Before I move on from the wireless infrastructure market, let me spend a couple of minutes going over our perspective on the rollout of 5G, including the key drivers, the frequency bands in play such as sub-6 gigahertz versus millimeter wave and the pace of deployment. \n First, Why 5G? Very simply, it significantly lowers the cost per bit of wirelessly transporting data, which benefits both carriers from an OpEx perspective and consumers by enabling a better user experience. Our base assumption is that for the next few years the overall wireless CapEx envelope will remain similar to historical patterns, but the better economics of 5G will inevitably transition wireless CapEx away from legacy 4G technologies. Even under this flattish CapEx assumption, we expect to drive significant revenue growth as our content and share in 5G is considerably higher than what we had in 4G. Over time, we expect that 5G will also create newer opportunities beyond the handset, which could drive an upward inflection in CapEx, and that would represent an upside to our base case. On the subject of sub-6 gigahertz versus millimeter wave, while we believe that both modes of deployment will see significant activity over the next few years, our view is that the vast majority of 5G base station CapEx will be spent on sub-6 deployment. \n A leading industry analyst has a similar forecast projecting that over 95% of the spend to go towards sub-6 deployment. Accordingly, we expect our wireless infrastructure revenue to follow a similar pattern and primarily derive from macro base stations. Having said that, as the small cell market develops in 5G, especially for millimeter wave applications, we are ideally situated to address these opportunities with our multi-core processor architecture, which can easily be scaled down to the relatively lower power and performance footprint needed in small cells. Our platform also enables significant software reuse for our customers as they scale down their macro solutions. We have a full set of capabilities for the wireless infrastructure market, including baseband, transport, Ethernet connectivity and DFE ASICs, making us the ideal chip provider for small cells, which are likely to require the integration of multiple functions in a single-chip or package for power and space considerations. \n In terms of timing, this is an infrastructure business where shifts from one technology to another are typically over a multi-year period, with the rate of adoption constrained by flattish CapEx budgets. We're at the very beginning of a multiyear transition to 5G, and the vast majority of this opportunity is in front of us. As you are aware, Korea is the only major geography, which started 5G deployments in earnest in calendar 2019. And while Korea is an important region for our lead customer, most of their base station shipments in 2019 used FPGAs for processing, and they only started to transition to our solutions late in the year. As a result, we expect significant revenue growth this fiscal year from deployments by Korean operators, and these deployments will continue for a number of years. \n Additional growth opportunities are also in front of us from geographies such as Japan and the U.S., when they start to deploy 5G later this year. With respect to China, Marvell historically had very limited exposure to their wireless infrastructure market; however, with the Avera acquisition, and our own organic efforts, we are now better positioned to also participate in China's 5G deployments. \n In summary, the wireless industry is starting to see a convergence of factors important for 5G adoption, including a more mature supply ecosystem, both on handsets and base stations and the opening up of additional spectrum, especially in the important sub-6 gigahertz bands. This combined with the better economics of the newer technology is increasingly driving carriers to shift their CapEx to 5G base stations, especially in regions where they are considering turning on 5G services in the near future. \n New 5G base stations are, of course, backward compatible with 4G and allow carriers to future-proof their networks rather than continue spending on legacy technologies. So as a result, we expect that wireless CapEx will continue to accelerate to 5G on the infrastructure side. Now let me shift gears from the 5G deep dive. We just announced our next-generation of ARM-based infrastructure processors, our OCTEON TX2 family, targeting a wide variety of networking equipment, including switches, routers, secure gateways, firewalls, network monitoring, smartNICs and base stations. This portfolio delivers 2.5x performance improvement over the prior generation and can scale up to 200 gigabits per second of packet processing, scaling from 4 cores at the low end to 36 cores for the most demanding applications. \n Compared to solutions processing data only on CPU cores, OCTEON's configurable and programmable hardware accelerator blocks, which include security, packet processing, traffic management functions provide a much better balance between power and performance in networking applications. In fact, we have already started shipping production -- we started production shipments of our OCTEON TX2 processors into our lead wireless infrastructure customer. \n Our Ethernet switch and PHY products continue to win new designs in their target markets. As a reminder, our Ethernet switch strategy has been to expand beyond our enterprise campus position into the enterprise core and aggregation layers and into service providers. We play to our strengths in offering feature-rich products and do not target the pure speeds and feed sockets in the hyperscale data center market where there was already strong incumbency and a large networking OEM that announced their plan to offer internal ASICs directly to cloud customers. Our ARM server products and our automotive products also remain well positioned for growth later this year. \n Now let me discuss our projection for our networking business in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, as compared to fourth quarter results. Please keep in mind that our fourth quarter results included approximately 5 weeks of revenue from the now divested Wi-Fi business. Therefore, I'll first provide you with our revenue expectation for the continuing networking business, which we project to grow sequentially by approximately low single digits on a percentage basis from fourth quarter results adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi. We expect this growth to be led by new product ramps in enterprise and cloud data center applications while we project flattish revenue from the wireless infrastructure market. Please note that this growth outlook includes the negative impacts currently known from coronavirus-related issues. \n To help you clearly model this outlook, let me also provide you with the projection for first quarter results as compared to our reported fourth quarter networking revenue of $377 million, which included the 5 weeks of Wi-Fi. Compared to this reported result, we expect networking revenue in our first quarter to decline in the low to mid-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. \n Now let me turn to our storage business. Storage revenue for the fourth quarter was $296 million and grew 3% sequentially, stronger than our expectations. The sequential growth was driven by an increase in demand for both of our storage controller product lines. Specifically, our HDD business continued to benefit from our growing position in the nearline market and our enterprise and data center SSD business continued to recover in the fourth quarter. These data center-led growth drivers more than offset the expected decline in the client market. Our fiber channel business remains strong and stable from the third quarter. \n As you may recall, at our prior investor days in 2017 and then again in 2018, we had articulated a storage strategy to focus on the enterprise and data center market and become less reliant on the client market. \n In our HDD business, we projected the client business to secularly decline as the shift towards SSDs and PCs accelerated and that we plan to focus on the growing nearline market. In addition, we shifted investment in our SSD business towards higher performance and stickier enterprise and data center solutions and DIY opportunities and away from the commodity client market, where margins were less attractive, and some of our customers were increasingly in-sourcing controllers. At this point in time, we believe that the bulk of the decline in exposure to the client market, including the impact of client SSD controller in-sourcing at some customers, is mostly behind us. We estimate that our total client revenue exposure collectively across both HDD and SSD controllers, starting fiscal 2021, is only 5% of the entire company's revenue. For context, at our Investor Day in October 2018, client storage was approximately 14% of total company revenue. \n In fact, sequential storage revenue growth in both the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 was driven by our enterprise and data center products. The next phase of our storage growth strategy we had outlined was the emergence of the DIY market for custom SSD controllers, and we are now a couple of quarters away from mass production of our first major design win. \n We also expect to continue to ramp our preamplifiers for HDDs over the next couple of years. Our recently introduced 12-nanometer PCIe Gen 4 SSD controller continues to receive strong interest from multiple customers, including several NAND OEMs for its optimized blend of high-performance and low power in a small form factor. \n Our Ethernet-based storage solutions are gaining momentum, and we just announced we are partnering with leading ODMs, Accton and Foxconn to bring our Ethernet Bunch of Flash or EBOF technology solutions to market. As you may recall, at FMS 2019, we demonstrated our NVMe over Fabric Ethernet SSD controller. This product enables a disruptive new data center architecture by directly connecting SSDs through a switch to an Ethernet network, without the need to go through a host, such as a server. These EBOF platforms will start sampling the spring and incorporate Marvell's NVMe over Fabric SSD controllers, Prestera Ethernet switches and up to 48 SSDs in a single chassis. \n In aggregate, we believe the growing footprint of our enterprise and data center storage controllers and preamps, upcoming ramp of our SSD DIY controllers and progress of our Ethernet-based storage initiatives, collectively positions our storage business for long-term success. Looking to the first quarter for our storage business, which is generally a seasonally down quarter for this end market, coupled with virus-related impacts to this business, we expect revenue to decline sequentially in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis. \n Let me close by thanking the more than 5,500 Marvell employees around the world for executing extremely well under difficult macroeconomic conditions. I am looking forward to an exciting fiscal 2021 to capitalize on the multiple growth initiatives we have been investing in over the last few years. Fiscal 2021 also marks an important milestone for Marvell, as we celebrate our 25th year anniversary. It has been a long and eventful journey, most recently punctuated with the company's transformation as we pivoted towards the infrastructure market. The financial community has been well aware of our journey, and we have now started to share our story with a broader audience. We held our first industry Analyst Day in early December, and the reception was outstanding. We received clear feedback that our story needs to be told more broadly as they see Marvell in the midst of multiple major trends, including 5G, AI, cloud and connected autos. \n We will continue to spread the message and are scheduling our next Investor Day for October 6 in New York, where we will provide an update on our progress towards our long-term goals. I look forward to seeing many of you at that event. \n And with that, I will turn over the call to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Sure. Great. Thanks, Atif. Yes, I think you got it exactly right. Just for everybody on the phone, we started off with a base case that we outlined pre-Avera, which was $600 million, which included the pipeline that we had identified of one business at that point. We successfully closed Avera, which brought in numbers in that approximate range you mentioned about roughly half of that business was 5G exposed. And so the way I would think about it is that the announcements that you've seen clearly add additional revenue on top of that. I think what we're excited about is, we really have now multiple customers for our 5G solutions, multiple products that we're selling to those customers, and that actually layer in over multiple generations, including existing business we're shipping today, new product ramps happening this year. And then as you referenced, even on our announcement with Nokia, a multigenerational agreement where we have products ramping later this year, but then even ongoing partnership to do more in the coming years on a spectrum of products. \n So I think, overall, it's very positive and clearly represents the announcements we've made, certainly a substantially higher number to what we've already communicated. Yes. I think, just to conclude, we've tried to size the impact as best we can. And as Jean mentioned, from our side, there's really 2 types of supply chain disruptions: There's disruption to some of our products, which are -- the bulk of the products that we ship every quarter are integrated circuits, but we do have some board business, both in Ethernet NICs and host bus adapters for fiber channel as well as some of the board-level products for smartNICs. And so even though our supplier base is actually outside of China and some of the impacted regions, they're having some challenges in sourcing some of the components. So that's one dynamic we see, but we're working through that. And then the second is, obviously, many of our end customers, factories or subcons are not at full capacity. So it's a fluid situation. But right now, what we're sizing is really what we see as supply chain-related impacts, both to us as well as our customers. Sure. Thanks. And I think we very much see our opportunity. It's both in the base station or the base BBU as well as the radio head, and we started to indicate that in the last few calls and even in some of my comments today, where, as an example, with Samsung, we're doing some very customized things with them in the radio head itself, which is really bringing our processing capability up from the base station unit into the radio head. And on top of that, so you sort of pick up, one trend is being processing power, processing, compute, moving up closer to the antenna. But the second is that, at least in some of the initial deployments of 5G, Korea was one example, but there's others. There's quite a high-density of massive MIMO radio heads attached to each base station. And so you sort of think about the idea that there's more processing power moving to the radio head, and then there's more radio heads attached per base station. It does create a significant opportunity. And that's a trend, by the way, that we see more broadly and not just is limited to one customer. So I think that's certainly exciting. \n I think the second is with respect to Analog Devices, we're sort of seeing each other now in these types of applications, starting with our DFE business that we have, but also in some of these applications where we're being asked to do more customized things in massive MIMO. And if you think about the architecture, where they have one of the leading positions, obviously, in the RF transceiver market and data converter market and us having a very strong position in the DFE, which is basically the digital chip that interfaces with the analog and mixed-signal functions. The coupling of those 2 is becoming even more and more important and so how do -- there's questions from how do we do things like co-packaging products together? How do we align on what the most ideal interfaces are for the chips to communicate with each other? What are the best architectures that we can pursue? And since the 2 companies are extremely complementary in their offerings, we see it as a great opportunity to actually innovate together and provide optimized solutions for our customers who really want to differentiate their products. And so the ADI team has got tremendous experience in this area. We, obviously, have a very experienced team of architects and technologists. And so really, the basis of the collaboration is to be able to address customers jointly and do that in a coordinated manner. So that's what we're doing. So I think the bottom line is we're as excited about the radio head opportunities as we are in the rest of the entire base station system. Yes. So yes, just to clarify. So yes, I was pretty explicit, but I'll say it again. The 5% number I gave you was for entire company. And so -- and for those of you who that have followed us from the beginning of our journey, I mean, I don't know exactly what this number was, Jean, but it was probably 30%, 40% of company back in 2016, so we've really worked on this one. And certainly, 2019 probably accelerated some of this transition that we already saw happening. So as we look forward, I think a couple of things: One is, we're very excited about our growth drivers. We did pivot the engineering 2 or 3 years ago to this nearline and enterprise-type of market for cloud capacity. I think there's a view that, that's going to continue to grow in terms of demand for those types of drives and we've increased our position both on the controller side as well as the addition of preamps. So that's a nice growth driver for us. The second is in SSD, as we've made the pivot from sort of supplying commodity client controllers to NAND OEMs to doing very sophisticated products that are doing things like Ethernet-attached storage or and, certainly, this trend of this do-it-yourself model, where we partner directly with the end OEM to define really an SSD, SOC, if you will. That trend is going very well and that we expect revenue growth from that. And so there's a number of exciting growth initiatives. And so I think, although a lot of the decline in client has occurred, clearly, on the HDD side, there will still be more to go as PCs transition. So the way we think about this business is we do think about it as certainly looking forward, given the exposure we have to client, it's something that can grow, it would be very modest. And we think keeping this in the low single-digit range is a very achievable goal. And given the strategic nature of this business to Marvell and the profitability profile, it's -- I think we got the right balance of investment and growth for this particular segment of our company. Well, look, I think, as was indicated in the prior questions, we do have a footprint today in radio head in a number of the applications. Some of those are from DFE or some of those are -- or actually, we indicated this also that certain customers have started using our fusion-based products to do massive MIMO processing while transitioning to more customized solutions. So those are there, and you should assume that these are large, advanced node digital chips. And so we're not calling out ASP specifically, but they're clearly high ASP devices in that, I don't know, call it, $100-ish plus range, and you can go -- you can sort of go multiples of that depending on the complexity and how many units, et cetera. So yes, these are normal large digital chips. And then, obviously, I know from your past, you're quite -- even today, you're still very knowledgeable about the analog market. So I think you know what that TAM looks like. And I think you also understand the interdependencies of the 2 and how critical that is to system design. So yes, it's really about the 2 companies working together and helping pull each other into mutually beneficial opportunities where we can work together. But yes, as far as ASPs goes, they're bigger digital chips. Very much so, and I would argue that was one of the key technical value props that we've been able to deliver. I think if you sort of think about this OCTEON-based architecture based on ARM present at all hops within the base station, whether it's massive MIMO processing in the radio head, whether it's the transport processing for layer 2, whether it's the baseband processing, it's very efficient when a customer actually goes all in with us. And certainly, these designs by nature are quite sticky because these base station designs are quite complex. It's not a second source business. Once you get in, they last a long time. But clearly, that's one of the key differentiators that our processor team has delivered consistently for 5 generations now of product. So that's absolutely how you should think about it. Sure. Yes, no, thanks. And I think -- thanks, Blayne. So in 2019 and certainly in the midst of the dynamics around the trade war, we saw a number of the enterprise OEMs, our customers get whipped around a little bit. And we certainly felt that in our results in a couple of different quarters. We were certainly encouraged after the signing of the Phase I deal that things seem to stabilize. And in fact, we had very strong order momentum, certainly, and bookings momentum in Q4. I think as that situation stabilized and we started to see a very strong recovery in our core business, which I think, as you know, is a very healthy business for us, and it's one that, prior to the trade war, we had actually been growing at a pretty significant rate. I think we had 6 quarters of double-digit growth in that business before we had the pause in 2019. So we were encouraged to see that return to growth, which was more of a, I call it a, restabilizing, but also actually growth. And then certainly, understanding now we're dealing with the coronavirus situation, but it certainly hasn't diminished at all our longer-term outlook, especially as we look through later this year with continued new product ramps. And what we brought in Aquantia, as an example, we paired up their multi-gate technology with our Prestera switches. We see multi-gig is a very clear trend that's happening. Our design win position has been very good there. We've actually brought in new customers, both on the PHY and the switch side in the last few years, which we believe will start bearing fruit. \n And then finally, what's embedded today in our networking number is also our automotive business, which is our automotive Ethernet. And while those are still smaller numbers today on a relative basis, they're growing every quarter and they're incrementally adding revenue, and we anticipate seeing acceleration in that business as we exit calendar '20, heading into model year '21 where a number of the vehicles we were designed into going back 1 and 2 years ago will start to ramp. So we actually have -- I'm glad you asked the networking question because it's a very large and important part of our business with some very exciting growth drivers to, I think, complement our also equally exciting 5G opportunities. So I think both of those are still in front of us. Yes, got it, Ross, and that's not a problem to clarify on Nokia. So first, we're obviously thrilled to have a public announcement about something like this. It clearly makes it a little bit easier to talk about this. And what I would say is, we've had a very good experience in the partnership so far with Nokia. We're very impressed by the team. And I think together, we've really executed well on this first product. And so as you think about what this means, what I would say is kind of 2 things: One is, I would think of it as a broadening of the opportunity and the relationship on the existing program we have, which means, obviously, multiple generation and then broadening our exposure within their products. And then, what the announcement also references is partnering around embedded processing and multi-core -- with our multi-core OCTEON family. So it's really a broadening of one and expansion as well. So we're -- it's a big deal for us. We're fully committed to execute with them to make them successful. And we think it's a great validation of the strategy we put in place a few years ago and the investments we've made. It's very rewarding to see this. We still have a lot of hard work in front of us because these are extremely complex chips and extremely demanding applications, but we're honored to be working with them and, certainly, to have an expanded opportunity set with them is a very good thing. Yes and, maybe I'll just add, I think that was captured to Jean, but I would just add, with respect to Avera, there's a couple of additional things to point out. I think one is the team is laser-focused on that particular segment. And we even highlighted it last quarter that there were some margin-related transition impact when we brought the business over. So there's a lot of specific work going on to improve that gross margin. What I would say, just to add to what Jean said on the relative trade we made between Avera and Wi-Fi, while the revenue levels, you call them similar, and margins were similar from a gross margin standpoint, the operating margin profile is quite different because with -- and that's something that we consciously got our heads around. And we're okay with Avera and the nature of that business comes with NRE funding for the projects, which offsets R&D. So it's a fundamentally higher operating margin business. And I would say, on top of that, it addresses a much larger SAM than we were going after with Wi-Fi, and we think that business has a much higher potential to grow in line with the company over time. And so yes, that was just my few extra comments on Avera. I think the right way to read it is kind of for what it says, which is the companies have entered into a multi-generation, multi-product collaboration and partnership, where we're going to be working together. We think, as I said earlier, we think that's good for Marvell. We think that's going to mean more business for us over time, if we execute and prove ourselves, then we think it's good for them because of the nature of the solutions we're providing. So I mean, if you think about -- as more and more of Nokia's business shifts to 5G and that becomes more important for them and, certainly, we hope to be part of the equation and helping them achieve their goals, we'll then benefit from the content gain that we have. And so I think that's the best way to think about it is, it's an extended relationship. There's new products we're working on. Teams are working really well together. This is a multiyear thing. And certainly, as 5G takes off for the industry and for Nokia, we'll -- we should be a big beneficiary of that with this rollout. Sure. Yes. No, it was -- I did have in my prepared remarks, but these were a little bit longer than normal just given all the challenges with corona and the various 5G things. So I apologize for that, but it was in there. What we said was that we -- our ARM server program was on track to ramp in the second half, as we've been indicating before. So we didn't really have a big change there. I think it's pretty consistent with what we've been saying so far. And I think that's the only update I've got on that, that program will -- we continue to work closely with the lead customer, and we're hoping that they ramp us in the second half. Yes, Harlan, I think the way I think about it is, you're right. I think NAND flash is very much making its way into new use cases and it's replacing conventional or traditional storage media. And certainly, that is one example that you mentioned. I think all we've said so far is we think that, that transition in that market is going to be positive for Marvell. We -- and I think that's probably it. As you can imagine, there's -- on that particular market, there's sort of tremendous confidentiality and sensitivity around that. So all I'd say is net-net, in that particular transition, I think that -- I know Marvell will do. It will be a net positive for Marvell. Yes. I think you're right. We've -- both companies Aquantia and Marvell have been -- had partnerships with Intel for some time. And what I would say is that the networking strength that we saw with bookings in Q4 and certainly our Q1 outlook was broad-based, but I would say for sure that the dynamics you mentioned, and that the server recovery and growth was quite strong, and that's certainly benefiting those particular businesses for us, both the Aquantia piece as well as us on the NIC side. Yes, I think the way to think about it is the announcement with ADI was really a desire for us to just make the market aware, all the stakeholders in the ecosystem, that the 2 companies, the teams were working together. We are already sort of jointly getting pulled into things, so I wouldn't sort of tie an ADI engagement to a new design win per se. I would say that we're pursuing opportunities, they're pursuing opportunities. We tend to show up in the same place. So this is a way for us to add value to our customers. But as I mentioned, as far as silicon for radio head, we have Fusion-based processors, right, that are shipping today. We have next-generation parts, which we've done a bunch of customization on with our customer IP. We see that trend continuing. We also have digital front-end ASIC-related content. So there's actually quite a bit that's going on there. So I would just think of it as an ongoing trend that we will see both growth in the digital unit as well as the radio heads. And to the extent that massive MIMO influx, and it becomes a major trend globally, and you think about the out years as our content grows both in the DUs and the radio heads, we think it just adds to the opportunity for Marvell. Certainly, more attach of massive MIMO means more capacity, more users, more silicon and more chips, and that's all the positive for us. So I don't think we have a split right now of like how do we think about how much is in where. And quite frankly, those lines, John, are blurring because a lot of the new standards from 3GPP in terms of the splits and where does the processing and the files actually sit, in what part of the network, in what part of the base station unit, it's fairly dynamic. And they have things like O-RAN coming, which is also defining a new way of doing processing. So a lot of diversity in the applications. We think we're well suited for all of them. But probably more to come on that as we go forward with our different engagements we're pursuing. Yes, great. Let me take in 2 pieces. So I think the first is you got it right. So the -- and again, sorry for so many 5s. So the first 5% number was our estimate of how much we -- now that we've guided to $680 million, we basically backed that down about 5% from where we were prior to corona hitting, where we saw Q4 -- sorry, Q1 lining up. So we did that in a fairly detailed way, just looking at the bridge from where we were to where we're guiding and the moving pieces. And as you mentioned, today they're all supply chain-related. We have really no way to know if there's been any demand disruption? Where it would occur? What's actually happening? I think that's to come. Certainly -- and then on the -- by the way, on the plus or minus 5%, that's independent. That's just saying, hey, at the midpoint, we normally guide plus or minus 3%. Given just how volatile this thing is, we don't know does it come back? Does this thing become more of a nonissue? There's a couple of them quite serious, even more serious today. So that's why we widened the range. And so yes, I think I just conclude by saying, I read the same probably reports you do, and we certainly see the activity that says factories are gradually coming back online. People in China are gradually going back to work. But we don't really know what the ripple effect is to the global economy candidly from this disruption. So we just don't know. And so that's why I think probably ourselves and peers are not hesitant to call the demand change. We just don't know. And so I think that's what's going to probably play itself out here over the coming quarter."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Ashish Saran, Vice President, Investor Relations. Sir, please begin.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's third quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO.I would like to remind everyone that certain comments today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and which could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements.During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our website in the Investor Relations section.With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance.\nMatthew Murphy: Great. Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As a reminder, we closed the acquisition of Aquantia in our third fiscal quarter, so our consolidated results include a partial quarter of results from their operations as well.During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered solid results and achieved $662 million in revenue. Our GAAP loss per share was $0.12, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.17 at the midpoint of guidance. Our storage business grew sequentially and we had better-than-expected results from our networking business. While we cannot influence the macroeconomic environment, I am very happy with our execution on the things we do control. Earlier this year, we discussed a number of significant design wins for our products in 5G base stations, enterprise switches, automotive Ethernet, and datacenter storage.In the third quarter, we continue to add to this growing list with more wins which I will discuss later in the call. Our engagement with customers continues to strengthen, which is becoming evident in our success in winning high value sockets in all our target markets, which we expect to drive sustainable growth over many years.In fact, one of our important growth drivers has already started to benefit us and I am very pleased that we shipped a significant amount of our 5G products in the third quarter, helping our key customer rapidly rollout base stations for the initial wave of 5G deployments in Korea. Of course, this is just a start of 5G deployments and we are looking forward to a lot more growth from 5G in the longer-term.More recently, we closed the acquisition of Avera on the first day of our fourth quarter. The acquisitions of Aquantia and Avera are very strategic to broadening our semiconductor solutions portfolio for our infrastructure customers. We are well on our way to integrating both teams within our networking business, and I would like to extend a warm welcome to all the new employees who have joined the Marvell team.We also expect to complete the divestiture of the Wi-Fi Connectivity Business to NXP in the first half of this month. However, as we currently still own the Wi-Fi business, my comments today on revenue expectations for the fourth quarter, include a full quarter of expected results from that business.I'd like to take this opportunity to personally thank the 600 dedicated employees in that business for their years of service to Marvell and for staying focused through this transition. We wish them all the best.Now moving on to the performance of our two core businesses. First, in our networking business, revenue during the quarter was $330 million, flat sequentially as compared to our expectations of a low single-digit decline. This improvement was split between partial quarter contributions from the Aquantia acquisition and organic Marvell businesses.During the quarter, macroeconomic uncertainty continued to impact demand from the enterprise end market. Additionally, as expected, demand for our Wi-Fi products declined seasonally. In contrast, our embedded processors delivered double-digit sequential revenue growth, driven by strong 5G shipments.As you may recall in the early part of this year, we had anticipated the start of initial production for our 5G products in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. However, last quarter, we announced that we were able to start production in the third quarter. Our key customer requested very aggressive delivery timelines to meet their commitments supporting 5G rollouts in Korea.Outstanding execution by our engineering and operations team, allowed us to rapidly ramp production and successfully deliver 5G products in volume within the third quarter itself. This was also very impressive demonstration of the maturity of our platform and quality of our NPI process that enabled us to transition from sampling our new 5G processors in the first quarter to driving a production ramp shortly thereafter.The third quarter was just the start of the 5G ramp for us as it was driven primarily by a single region. We expect these initial deployments in Korea to continue to be the main driver for our 5G revenue for another couple of quarters and we should start to see the benefit from other geographies later in fiscal 2021.By the time we approach the second half of next fiscal year, we expect a strong increase in our 5G-related revenue driven by continued Korea deployment and the start of 5G adoption in Japan and other countries such as the U.S. as they start to install 5G base stations in higher volumes.In addition, we expect to start production of baseband processors for our second Tier 1 base station customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 further adding to our overall 5G revenue ramp.Our progress to date has also enabled us to engage with them in longer-term technology roadmap discussions. The broadening adoption of our 5G platform is a testament to the advanced capabilities of our multi-core embedded processor portfolio further complemented by our Ethernet switch and PHY products. And we now have added Avera's full custom ASIC capabilities, enabling us to offer an industry-leading 5G suite of technology.But before I move on to the Avera acquisition, let me spend a couple of minutes on the unique capabilities of our OCTEON-embedded processor platform. As you may recall, OCTEON was the first multi-core processor architecture with a complete set of on-chip hardware accelerators for networking applications. Since then the OCTEON platform has been widely adopted for control and data plane processing across a broad range of networking applications, including base stations, switches, routers, broadband access and firewall appliances.This platform now scales up to 48 optimized ARM cores and includes hardware optimized packet processors, crypto engines, virtualization support and a wide variety of network interfaces. Our Fusion baseband processors are built on the same proven OCTEON architecture, adding baseband specific hardware accelerators and DSP cores.An important benefit for OCTEON and Fusion customers is the ability to reuse the entirety of their sizable control and data plane software investment as they design in our products across their portfolio. The software reuse not only speeds our customers development cycles, but also creates very sticky designs for Marvell.Our OCTEON and Fusion family include fully programmable ARM & DSP cores, enabling an extremely flexible and scalable architecture further optimized by implementing certain fixed functions and hardware acceleration blocks.The speed, simplicity and scalability of the OCTEON programming model has been a key differentiator and an important driver for the adoption of our processors in multiple applications. In addition, as processing spreads into new domains and base stations, such as the radio head, customers are also turning to our processors for new functions.As an example, as we discussed earlier this year, one of our customers adopted our existing Fusion baseband solution from massive MIMO processing. This represented their fastest route to market as their software was already up and running on the OCTEON architecture and the Fusion implementation was flexible enough to extend to their massive MIMO application. Longer-term, customers will often require a customized OCTEON Fusion processor optimized for specific applications, such as the complex Beamforming needed for massive MIMO.I am pleased to announce that we now have been awarded such a design win by a key customer for a Fusion-based solution customized for massive MIMO processing in the radio head. The additional complexity in the solution is also enabling a higher ASP than our existing baseband products.In addition, we are driving a fast time-to-market by leveraging the flexibility in our processor platform and expect to complete development in under one-year allowing us to start ramping this product into production by the beginning of calendar 2021. We are also in advanced discussions with the second customer for processing solutions for massive MIMO.Moving onto Avera. The combination of Avera and Marvell creates an infrastructure ASIC powerhouse with the scale and design flexibility leading wireline and wireless OEMs are looking for from their semiconductor partners. Kevin O'Buckley, who is Avera\u2019s General Manager has joined Raghib\u2019s team and will be leading the ASIC business for Marvell.In addition to Kevin, we are fortunate to be adding multiple key leaders from Avera who along with the talented global Avera team bring a tremendous amount of industry experience and technical capability. This team originally part of IBM's Microelectronics business brings a proven track record of delivering a large number of highly-complex ASICs to very demanding customers.In terms of revenue, we continue to expect that Avera will contribute approximately $300 million in annual revenue next fiscal year. A significant amount of Avera\u2019s revenue is from the wireless infrastructure market primarily for digital front-end ASICs and radio heads which aligns extremely well with Marvell\u2019s expanding presence in base stations. The base station revenue from Avera will be an addition to the organic Marvell opportunities I discussed earlier.We estimate that Avera brings an incremental $4 billion to Marvell\u2019s addressable market across the datacenter, carrier, enterprise and automotive end markets. Avera\u2019s design capabilities coupled with our broad technology platform will allow us to leverage our combined IP portfolio across the full spectrum of custom, standard and semi-custom solutions. We also expect to benefit from a broader combined customer base.As I mentioned earlier, we have now added Aquantia\u2019s leading multi-gig Ethernet products to Marvell\u2019s broad switch and PHY portfolio, extending our reach in both the network, infrastructure and the rapidly growing automotive Ethernet market.Faraj Aalaei, who is Aquantia\u2019s CEO has joined Marvell and taken on a broader role has the General Manager for all our Ethernet products, including automotive. Faraj brings a tremendous amount of industry experience and we're looking forward to working with him and his team. We have already integrated roadmaps to create a very compelling end-to-end Ethernet connectivity portfolio and in fact the combined Marvell and Aquantia team have already secured their first major design win together.This win was for a multi-gig Ethernet PHY in a Tier 1 networking OEMs campus switch platform, and we expect to start ramping production in the second half of next fiscal year. In addition, the response from multiple automotive customers to the combined company roadmap has been very strong and we are jointly working on additional opportunities to add to the 16 design wins Marvell has already won across a broad range of OEMs.From a revenue perspective, macroeconomic uncertainty impacted Aquantia\u2019s revenue in the first half of Aquantia\u2019s fiscal year as their key customers reduced purchases to better master inventory with demand. With the acquisition now complete, we expect to grow this business to approximately $100 million in annualized revenue in fiscal 2021. In fact, Aquantia\u2019s revenue was already started to recover from their June quarter on a run rate basis.Turning now to the growing ecosystem for ARM-based compute in the datacenter. At the Supercomputing Conference in Denver, we announced the availability of NVIDIA GPU support for ThunderX2-based server platforms to provide HPC and cloud customers with a powerful solution for exascale computing.In addition, we recently announced that Microsoft has started to deploy servers based on Marvell's ThunderX2 server processors for internal Azure development workloads. We believe that this is an important milestone on the path to the broader adoption of ARM-based servers across the Azure platform. The progress of ThunderX adoption at our cloud and HPC customers gives us confidence and expecting revenue growth next fiscal year from our server processors starting from a base of low initial volumes and then continuing to ramp in the second half.As we look beyond the datacenter server market, we are also seeing multiple opportunities to leverage our ThunderX processor cores in SoC or ASIC solutions for applications requiring embedded high-performance compute engines.Moving onto our outlook for the fourth quarter for our networking business, driven primarily by full quarter contributions from Avera and Aquantia, we expect an approximate 25% sequential increase in networking revenue. We are expecting revenue from Aquantia products to continue to recover from the low point they reported earlier this year.For the rest of Marvell's networking business, we expect 5G shipments to remain strong, while demand from the enterprise end market remains weak, including a decline from a number of Chinese customers.As you may recall in prior quarters, we had indicated that these customers appear to be building inventory to guard against any future potential supply chain disruptions. As a result in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we are anticipating a sequential decline from that elevated run rate, in addition to general end market softness. We are also projecting the Wi-Fi business to decline seasonally in the fourth quarter.Turning to our storage business. Storage revenue for the third quarter was $288 million, growing 5% sequentially. As expected, this growth was driven primarily from the enterprise and datacenter market. However, we did experience weaker than expected revenue from the edge market, with a softening in demand from gaming and video surveillance.We also continue to see a rapid conversion from HDDs to SSDs in the PC market, which presents a headwind for our client business. Despite challenges from current trends in the client and edge markets, our strategy to focus on the enterprise and datacenter market, including a strong position in high-capacity cloud drives, continues to payoff to drive growth for the overall storage business.Last quarter, we introduced the industry's first PCIe Gen 4 SSD controller based on a 12-nanometer process. This product delivers higher performance in a lower power envelope in a space optimized package to enable our customers to develop smaller form factor solutions. In addition, our solution also allows customers to eliminate DRAM from their SSDs, which also reduced the size and power while lowering their bill of material.Multiple customers, including several NAND OEMS are deeply engaged in evaluating our product as it uniquely addresses a number of their emerging mainstream SKUs where they need to balance performance and power in a small form factor solution.This PCIe Gen 4 architecture is also the basis for our customized SoC flash controllers for embedded and do-it-yourself applications. Our first major DIY design at a Tier 1 system level OEM is in the final stages of development. We expect a sharp ramp in revenue from this product in the third quarter of next fiscal year when our customer begins mass production of their system.Turning to the fourth quarter for our storage business. We project revenue to be flat to up slightly on a sequential basis. We expect our revenue from the datacenter and enterprise end markets to continue to grow from a strong third quarter and offset weaker trends in the edge and client markets.In closing, we continue to win new designs and position ourselves for solid growth with strong execution on new product introductions. Our 5G products have started shipping in volume, helping us offset macro weakness in other end market such as enterprise. We expect 5G base station deployments to expand into multiple geographies later next fiscal year, which we anticipate will drive a substantial increase in revenue.In addition, we continue to expand our engagement with a broad set of Tier 1 5G customers. Our storage business has stabilized, benefiting from our growing exposure to enterprise and datacenter applications and grew appreciably in the third quarter. The acquisitions of Aquantia and Avera meaningfully increased our addressable market opportunity and add the Marvell's infrastructure capabilities to create a very unique technology platform. I am looking forward to an exciting fiscal 2021.With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our results and outlook.\nJean Hu: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter, which includes a partial quarter results from the Aquantia acquisition, which we closed on the 19 of September. As a reminder, the guidance provided on the 29 of August for the third quarter did not include any contributions from the pending Aquantia acquisition. Revenue in the third quarter was $662 million versus our guidance of $660 million at midpoint.Networking represented 50% of our revenue in the third quarter, with storage contributing 43%. Revenue from our other business was $45 million in the third quarter below expectations and declined 14% sequentially. Other products accounted for 7% of revenue.GAAP gross margin was 51.3%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $421 million or 63.5% of revenue at midpoint of our guidance range. GAAP operating expenses were $402 million.Non-GAAP operating expenses were $283 million, slightly above the midpoint of guidance due to the closure of Aquantia acquisition within the quarter. Without the impact from the Aquantia acquisition, non-GAAP operating expenses would have been below the low end of guidance.Our current level of OpEx reflects a lower level of bonus accrual. GAAP operating loss was $62 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $138 million or 21% of revenue. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.12. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.17 at a midpoint of our guidance.Now turning to the balance sheet. In the third quarter, we returned $40 million to shareholders through dividend and then we exited the quarter with $438 million in cash and cash equivalents. Long-term debt was $2 billion, an increase of approximately $350 million from the prior quarter. The increase was from drawing down our revolving credit facility for funding acquisition of Aquantia.Inventory increased to $68 million from the prior quarter, $31 million of the increase with from the Aquantia acquisition including the accounting fair value step up. The balance of the increase was to support the expected growth of our 5G business.Let me now move on to our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which include the expected results from the Aquantia and Avera acquisitions for the full quarter. This guidance also includes expected results for the full quarter from the Wi-Fi business.Once the sale of the Wi-Fi business is completed, we will update the revenue portion for our guidance for the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our revenue in the current quarter to remain impacted by the U.S. government\u2019s export restrictions on certain Chinese customers.Specifically, we expect revenue to be in the range of $750 million plus or minus 3%. We anticipate our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 45.5% and our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 62%. Avera is a cover out from GlobalFoundries and that we have a certain one-time transition cost that are expected to negatively impact our gross margin in the fourth quarter.We expect our gross margin to return to more than 63% once we complete the divestiture of Wi-Fi business and a fully integrate Aquantia and Avera into Marvell supply chain. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $445 million to $455 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $315 million to $320 million.We expect net interest expense to be approximately $26 million. As a reminder, at the beginning of our fourth quarter, we financed the acquisition of Avera with a $600 million bridge loan, and this increase in debt is reflected in our guidance for interest expense. We anticipate GAAP loss per diluted share in the range of $0.17 to $0.23 and the non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.15 to $0.19.Before we open the line for questions, let me make a couple of longer-term comments on operating expenses expectations given we have a few moving parts from three transactions. First, due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes, merit increases and the reset of bonus accruals from the current low level, we expect our non-GAAP OpEx in the first quarter of next fiscal year to grow by approximately 5% on a sequential basis.Second, we have quickly started to integrate both Aquantia and Avera and the ERP integration have been largely completed, enabling a faster start toward synergy achievement. We will continue to drive the remaining synergy achievement and the operating efficiency improvement through fiscal 2021, while investing in a growth initiative to position us to deliver long-term profitable growth.Once we complete the divestment of Wi-Fi business and the fully integrated Aquantia and Avera, we expect OpEx to decline through the rest of fiscal 2021 from the Q1 high point I just outlined. As a result, we project our non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 next fiscal year will be approximately $300 million.Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Thanks.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your question, please.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Matt, a few quarters ago, you gave $600 million long-term opportunity in 5G, what is the confidence in achieving that? And just what does that number look like now that Avera in the mix, and I think you highlighted some additional opportunities also in massive MIMO.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes. Great. Thanks, Vivek. So I think to answer your first question, you're right. A couple of quarters ago, we articulated the $600 million number which was really the business that we had already secured design wins for. We still feel very good about that opportunity.And in fact, as we indicated in the prepared remarks, there's even been some incremental change to that on the positive side as we transition at least one of our customers to a higher ASP product in the massive MIMO area. So that tends to be tracking well in terms of the design opportunities and our customer positioning. So we're quite confident there.On Avera, what we said was about half their revenue was from the wireless infrastructure market and base stations of which a portion of that is tied to 5G. And certainly, we see that contributing as well and that would be on top of the $600 million.And I look forward to completing full quarter with Avera under our belt and then articulating the combined opportunity in the future, but it's definitely above $600 million just given the fact that Avera is bringing in pretty significant revenue in the base station market.\nVivek Arya: All right. And for my follow-up, Jean, thanks for giving us the gross margin and the OpEx puts and takes. I was hoping, you could just for clarification give us just the contributions of the different M&A moving pieces in your Q3 and Q4, so that we can align the models accordingly.\nJean Hu: Yes. Vivek, it's actually quite straightforward. If you think about our operating expense guidance for Q4, which include both Aquantia and Avera for the full quarter, which also include the Wi-Fi business. So moving forward, if we end up closing the Wi-Fi sale in our Q4, the best way to think about it is, I also guided you Q4 next year, the OpEx is going to be $300 million without Wi-Fi business.So a simple way to think about this, that's how we're going to migrate. We're going to have a merit and bonus increase reset in Q1, but we're going to absorb those increase by improving efficiency and achieving additional synergies. So you can largely view the difference between Q4 this year, and the Q4 next year. It's the difference, it's the Wi-Fi business getting out.\nVivek Arya: I meant on the sales side, Jean, if you could give us the puts and takes in Q3, Q4 from \u2013you completed Aquantia in Q3, which added probably some small amount. And then in Q4, right you have the two acquisitions. But then Wi-Fi goes out, but is down seasonally. I'm just trying to contrast the outlook that you gave versus what people's expectations were going into the quarter. Thank you.\nJean Hu: Okay, great. So Q3, Q4 is actually when you think about that is Q3 our OpEx is about $280 million without any acquisitions. We actually achieved the significant amount of the synergy right at the beginning of the two acquisitions. So the two acquisitions probably add about $37 million of OpEx. That's why the Q4 midpoint of OpEx guidance is the current level.So the way to think about it is $280 million step up because of the two acquisitions. And then when you get into Q1 next year, of course, we're going to have the Wi-Fi business coming out if we close the transaction. But at the same time the OpEx will stay around the same level because that 5% sequential increase from the merit and the bonus reset.\nAshish Saran: Hey, Vivek, this is Ashish. So I think from a \u2013 I think your question is also on the topline side. So I think for Q3, again, Aquantia was therefore, a fairly small period and it's a fairly small number. So the Q3 revenue is pretty much, you should assume it's really Marvell with a very small help from the Aquantia side.I think on Q4, again, I think what we can do to remind you of kind of what we expect on a full-year basis. So as Jean said, Avera is a $300 million business, right for next year. Aquantia, next year, we believe, is about $100 million. But as Jean said, it's still recovering toward that number, right as you remember from where they were originally.Wi-Fi, again, if you remember when we said the divestment, it's a $300 million business, right. So you can do the quarterly number and it's on the low end of that number given we are at the seasonally low point. I think that's how you can think about revenue for Q4.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Your line is open.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was just kind of curious, I mean, you've obviously had, you've talked about more opportunities on the wireless side and you can deal with. You haven't had ASIC capabilities. Just kind of curious the timelines that kind of combine these roadmaps and scale of Avera and kind of if you can just talk about the pipeline, as you look forward, opportunities that you've looked at with your customers that you could potentially move over with those capabilities.\nMatthew Murphy: Sure, great question. So a couple of things, so one is, I talk about in two dimensions. The first is, we've already had hit the ground running on the customer side. So there has been a pretty extensive global roadshow with the combined Marvell and Avera team to articulate our strategy for both 7 and 5-nanometer in our technology platform.We're doing this in a very targeted manner and really think about it as we're going to address. We're going to line up our IP roadmap that we've had inside the company with the end customer orientation. So we're going to go more narrow and go much bigger with a handful of large customers across those end markets I mentioned which is cloud, enterprise, automotive and also base stations and that's gone extremely well.The second is we've done already a very good job with the team, integrating the IP team from Avera and also the backend teams into one consolidated Central Engineering effort. So when we hit the ground running on our next-generation process technology platform, we're going to have one platform that we can leverage for our ASIC business for our semi-custom business and for our standard product business.And that's resonating very well with the customer base. I think they wanted to see us actually bring the team together quickly and have one integrated offering. And I would say the feedback has been phenomenal from the roadshow in terms of interest from all those end markets that I mentioned.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks. And then maybe if you just talk about the ramp of your lead base station customer, you said you shipped it early, you've been hitting these aggressive timelines. Obviously, they needed to deploy those, get them quality carriers and ramp. I think you\u2019re looking for contribution in January. Can you speak to whether that's still on track in your guidance? And then if there is any visibility, you mentioned some regions, but in terms of the traction they're getting and your visibility into getting those targets for that customer? Thanks.\nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Yes, I know it ramped up and it ramped up fairly steeply, which was positive, it's going to probably remain certainly from a Korea standpoint, it will keep deploying at that level. And then we see continued momentum as our customer deploys in other regions and within those other regions, other carriers within those regions. And certainly even in the Korea market, I think the best is still in front of us, if you look at subscriber penetration, which has been very fast in Korea. I think to-date, it's around 15% of total subscribers around 5G and certainly that's going to trend significantly higher next year.So I think of it as sort of the first step is Korea's ramps and it's going to stay strong for the next few quarters and then we anticipate additional regions kicking in, in the outer quarters with what looks to be a very strong second half as 5G really picks up momentum and our design position should enable us to participate in that.\nBlayne Curtis: Great. Thank you.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your question please.\nRoss Seymore: Thanks for letting me ask a question. Matt, I want to focus more on the enterprise side of things. In your preamble, you talked a little bit about the China inventory digestion. But last quarter you also talked about some of the big customers that hit you with some order cancellations relatively close to your call. So overall, I just wanted to see, how long do you think that inventory burn in China is going to last and did the weakness that you saw from that large customer continue into the fourth quarter guidance, or is that kind of plateaued?\nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Thanks, Ross. Let me talk about them in two distinct pieces because they are a little bit different. I think on the China side what we signaled was we did see inventory being built. I think, primarily due to concerns about restrictions from an entity list point of view, and we had signaled that over the last couple of quarters, we saw it happen and we called out that we now see the \u2013 we see that reflected in our Q4 outlook, which is that inventory had been built in Q3 and that was not going to continue into Q4.So that's sort of a separate geo political issue on the enterprise market relative to the broader enterprise market. We certainly were impacted. Last quarter, we did signal that we had a slowdown in the outlook fairly close to the call. That's continued. And I think if you just look at the commentary in general, out of the market. I think most of the large companies selling into the enterprise are continuing to have a weaker outlook primarily due to the macro.And I think the way we look at it is, certainly there is some \u2013 if you look at United States that while the consumer is strong, I think the business environment tends to be fairly cautious and until there is maybe more clarity on some of the trade related issues or there is some conclusion, it's going to continue to remain choppy and so that's what we're seeing currently.I'd say \u2013 I\u2019d end this whole thing by saying at the same time, because of our \u2013 the investments we made in some of these new emerging areas and candidly the teams very strong execution on our new product development, we've been able to offset some of this weakness and 5G was one example. This past quarter, which we expect to continue, but we also as we said in our prepared remarks, we see multiple growth drivers heading in the next year, which even with a weaker macro we think our product cycles will carry us through.\nRoss Seymore: That's great. Thanks for that. And my follow-up one for you Jean, I guess maybe a clarification, then the question. The clarification on the OpEx, does it got 5% sequentially in the first quarter for all the reasons you described before, but then comes back down when the Wi-Fi comes out, so that nets out kind of flat?And then the question behind that would be on the gross margin side of things, you gave great color about what it would do once you get the integration done. Would you care to give us any idea on exit rates like you said on OpEx being $300 million next fiscal year. What the gross margin might be? Is that about when you get over the 63% again or is there some different timetable we're talking about?\nJean Hu: So if you think about gross margin, right the two major drivers are revenue level and the product mix. We are quite confident once we complete the Wi-Fi divestiture and the fully integrated two acquisitions that we should get to about 63% very quickly, but then beyond that really is going to be driven by revenue level.When our revenue level recover, it helps that you pull out gross margin further about that level, and of course, product mix is another one. Typically, we'll see how the product mix goes each quarter, but we are quite confident we'll be able to drive the gross margin about 63% quickly probably in Q1 next quarter \u2013 next fiscal year and go beyond that.\nRoss Seymore: On the OpEx side?\nJean Hu: On the OpEx side, I think really \u2013 you're absolutely right, when you look at the bonus reset and merit to increase the payroll tax all added together in Q1. That's the 5% sequential increase that we discussed, but then we'll take down that OpEx to the $300 million level access in Q4 fiscal 2021.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nGary Mobley: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Let me apologize in advance if there's any background noise. Wanted to ask about sort of the revenue breakdown, post sale of the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth business? It sounds like the baseline there for that business in the fourth quarters, excluding that business $675 million. And how should we think about the seasonality off of that as we start out fiscal year 2021 and progress through that fiscal year?\nJean Hu: Yes. Okay. Gary, I'll try to give you some color. We're certainly not guiding next fiscal year, but typically the way to think about our revenue seasonality without Wi-Fi business is Q1, sequentially versus the Q4 they will be slightly low single-digit decline that's just regular seasonality.And then when you migrate into Q2 will increase slightly. I think the most important thing in the second half as Matt mentioned, we have some very significant revenue drivers, so that related to our own product cycle despite overall normal seasonality or macroeconomic situation, those drivers are coming from the 5G from DIY SSD solutions. So those things are going to drive our revenue significantly higher in second half. So that's the only color I can give you right now.\nGary Mobley: Okay. Well that's helpful. And just to confirm some of the stats for the connectivity business, was it being down seasonally in the fourth fiscal quarter, presumably somewhere in the ballpark of $65 million. Can you confirm that this business is still 50% gross margin business in more than likely operating breakeven in the current quarter?\nJean Hu: I think the right way to think about this, what we gave to you guys before right. This business operated around the $300 million revenue with some seasonality and gross margin around the 50%. So that's what we provided in the past.\nGary Mobley: Okay. All right, fair enough. Thank you, guys.\nMatthew Murphy: Thanks, Gary.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from C.J. Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.\nC.J. Muse: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. I guess as you learn more about the plans for your lead customer on the 5G side and you gain a better understanding of kind of geographically outside of Korea, the build plans. Can you speak to how you think about your market share there as well as content as we push forward?\nMatthew Murphy: Yes. Just to make sure I got this, you're really saying hey beyond Korea for our lead customer, what is the deployment look like, and then what is our content relative to maybe some of those different regions? Did I get that right, C.J.?\nC.J. Muse: Yes, exactly.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes. So I think the way to think about it is, first, just on the content side, this tends to be one platform. The only differences I would note is to the extent that in certain regions that massive MIMO is deployed more extensively, then that's certainly a positive thing for us because we have more content in those radio heads. And as I mentioned, we already have some content today in radio heads and in the future we would have in a more customized purpose built solutions.Beyond Korea, we see certainly Japan deploying next year. A lot of that's driven by the country hosting the Olympic Games. Certainly, for those of us here in the United States, you can see the pretty strong momentum among the various carriers about their plans to deploy 5G and that's probably more robust later in 2020.I think there is certainly with respect to the device side, there is a slew of devices out there, but the sort of the Holy Grail that people have in mind is when there is an iPhone 5G and to the extent that that the timing of that product becomes clear, I think we certainly think that that will help overall adoption of 5G and drive demand for the service, probably very similar to when the product initially came out and made the transition to 3G, that drove a big cycle and we've seen cycle subsequently from 3G to LTE to 5G.So I think there is a number of positive data point, certainly we get more and more encouraged about the adoption of the technology. And then there are other things going on. There is a spectrum licenses in India and other countries, and I think we're just going to see a continued sort of evolution of various countries around the world deploying, but for us it's really Korea, Japan, United States and then to some extent depending on when India decides to kick in.Our lead customers always had a strong presence in that region. But again, content, you should assume unless there's some very high adoption of massive MIMO in a particular region should be very similar to the numbers we've been talking about.\nC.J. Muse: Okay, very helpful. I guess as my follow-up, now that Avera disclosed. Can you talk a bit about the strategy to try to bring there, I guess your number one customer there in-house on the ASP side?\nMatthew Murphy: Well, what I'd say is and what's resonating well is that the \u2013 across all of \u2013 quite frankly our combined Tier 1 5G customers and base station customers is that our end-to-end portfolio and our offering is second to none, okay. I mean, there is not another company that has all of these various pieces under one roof, right from Baseband IP to transport processing IP, front haul connectivity. Obviously, DFE, now we're getting very strong DFE experience and capability from Avera and plus some of the massive MIMO efforts we're putting in.So that I would say across the board has resonated extremely well that entire data chain being able to be provided by Marvell, and so certainly we're engaged both with the Avera customer base as well as the Marvell customer base and presenting it as one unified strategy.There is no specific update on an existing customer, but I will say just having brought Avera on board, recently, I mean we've already gotten RFQs from several customers that \u2013 new customers for Avera right and we're bringing those Marvell relationships and so we're still early days, but certainly to be effectively a month in and be already engaged in these types of discussions is very encouraging to me.\nC.J. Muse: Very helpful. Thank you.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your question, please.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the Thunder opportunity, you talked in the main remarks about the update from Microsoft, which was good to see. How do you size that potential? And what are the prospects for other customers, both with domestic cloud and also in China for that?\nMatthew Murphy: Sure. So let me give a big picture first, and then we can give \u2013 frame our opportunity. So I think one positive thing certainly out of the Super Computing Conference this year and you can even look as recently as the last couple of days with Amazon's events. It's pretty clear that the ecosystem for ARM-based server class CPUs continues to grow.I mean, certainly in the couple of years, we've had the business or even less. There has been a tremendous progress there and so we look at it, one, as a positive that there is a number of different solutions, now they are coming to market. The partnership with NVIDIA, it's been significant. And I think the ability to go work interoperate with them, certainly in the exascale type of opportunities is a big deal.We were pleased to announce that we progress on the Microsoft front and that we put out the joint press release and we certainly see that those deployment starting initially in the early part of next year and then ramping in the second half. I think it's a little bit early to call the size and the slope. But clearly, we're encouraged that we've gone through the gauntlet of qualifications and joint development there over the last couple of years, it's been a great partnership, and we are looking forward to this ramping into production in the second half.And I think everybody knows the sort of size of the server CPU market is deca billions of dollars. I mean at our own Analyst Day, we said the subset of that that we were going after was probably in the range of $4 billion or so of SAM, just as a subset. So it still remains a big opportunity, still lucrative, but we'll probably give more color as we approach production ramps to be able to give you a sense of what that looks like.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On your second Fusion customer for 5G base stations, they've made some commentary on wanting to pull in their development schedules and accelerate their time to market, with their 5G platforms. The Fusion program is a semi custom program.So I think that there's only so much that you guys can do to kind of pull in these type of projects, but do you see the potential for possibly pulling in the production ramp into fiscal Q3 and then on future programs with this customer, which you already seem to be engaged with, what's the potential of increasing your dollar content to include things like OCTEON-embedded for control and data plane, your Ethernet products, your radio head content from both core Marvell and Avera.\nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Well, thanks for the question. So I think the way I'd frame it at a high level, is if you look at our lead customer and I noted some of the statistics about how fast we were able to bring them to production. And just the overall, development cycle time. I think that was one compelling reason why we were chosen.And the second opportunity was really the confidence in the team's ability to dramatically improve the historical cycle times of getting these types of ASICs out in general in the base station market. And so we've got some really strong proof points I think and we're executing extremely well to the aggressive schedule that we had committed to upfront for the second customer. We certainly approved our team's capability to the extent that people want to try to go earlier than we would certainly do everything we could.We are currently on track to sample the product, tape out sample production in line with what we've been saying and that's currently the plan of record. But we're always very sensitive when our customers want to go faster and to the extent that they \u2013 we could mutually align and that we would, but at this point, we are committed \u2013 we already committed to pretty aggressive schedule to begin with. And so that's what we're sticking to.On the second part of the question. At least so far the \u2013 because the partnership has been strong and the engagement and we've been delivering to what we said. Anytime you do that with the customer it opens up opportunities. And so again, you kind of nailed it between OCTEON for the transport, full ASIC capability for DFE and the ability to add even some Marvell IP and their massive MIMO Ethernet front-haul connectivity, it's a pretty compelling portfolio.So we're hopeful to continue to win more business across the board and certainly, the best way we can do that is live up to our promises and execute really thoroughly to what we commit to, and that's what we're intending on doing at least with this current opportunity.\nHarlan Sur: Well, thanks for the insights there. And then on storage, last quarter, I believe you guys were still shipping under consumption in the storage business and so still some room to get back to normal consumption levels on top of that I think that you're ramping pretty strongly into your two customers, nearline 16 terabyte HDD programs and that's looking to be a pretty strong tailwind for them in the first half of next year. Your enterprise SSD platforms are doing well, cloud spending is accelerating. So help us understand why the business on a sequential basis doesn't seem to be growing in the January quarter.\nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Yes, I think you nailed the growth drivers pretty well and certainly, I think the effort candidly that we put in over the last three years to really repivot the storage business and focus on the cloud and enterprise and get those design wins and get them \u2013 products developed and get them ramped that's all starting to play out, and that's helping offset what we see is pretty continued weakness both in the client side.I think there's been some pretty well-telegraphed challenges on the CPU front in terms of ability to build enough notebooks that hasn't helped anybody certainly the drive companies, and the end OEMs. I think also the export restrictions in the bands relative to some of the Chinese OEMs and the video surveillance area. Clearly those video surveillance cameras and devices have a tremendous amount of storage attached to them, and that's also got some impact that's a derivative impact. We don't sell directly into those companies, but we sell to drive companies that may or may not have business there and that's certainly a weakness too.So I think, we see these edge and client markets being fairly soft and then offsetting it or even in the case of Q3 more than offset it was strong growth on these product cycles and the tailwind that you mentioned. And so what we're going to continue to do is continue to execute our strategy. We've been putting all of our R&D efforts into the markets that are growing today, and where we can control our destiny on research and development and product execution, we will. Some of these other things like PC CPU shortages or government bans on, it's hard for us to influence those. All we can do is manage around it, and where we can control our destiny.\nHarlan Sur: Thanks, Matt.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your question, please.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. I guess the first question, Jean is maybe if not some qualitative at least some qualitative commentary around what the, what the long-term financial model will look like for the new company. You were saying before you could get about 66% gross margin and sort of 30% to 32% OpEx target. I know gross margin, you said, will be back above 63% exiting fiscal 2021, but where should we kind of think about sort of the upside beyond the 63% and sort of where OpEx can go in with sort of the new company here.\nJean Hu: Yes. Tim, thanks for the question. I think in the longer-term, we are quite confident we will continue to drive the gross margin expansion with the combined portfolio. Especially, we are very much focused in the infrastructure market as Matt mentioned, we have very broad portfolio.Overall, as I said earlier, gross margin impacted by both level of revenue and the product mix. When we recover from the current revenue level and continue to expand, especially with our 5G ramp and other new product cycles unique to Marvell in the second half next year, we do see with the revenue level going up that will help improve our gross margin and the progress is toward that target level.On the operating margin side, we continue to focus on operating margin expansion. So our focus is definitely is the same operating margin target like before. We continue to manage the SG&A costs to make sure it's below 7% of revenue, and R&D, the investment is very important for us to drive the longer-term profitable growth, and so we continue to invest in our business. So once our revenue level going up, our model is highly leverageable, we will get to our operating model quickly.\nTimothy Arcuri: Got it, Jean. Thanks for that. And then I guess, Matt, maybe can you give us some sense, I know maybe you don't want to give us a number, but of the $288 million in storage, can you give us a sense of how much is SSD sort of on a relative basis and maybe from a competitive point of view, how much do you worry about the threat of your customers who continue to try to actively displace you there, I mean how real is that? Thanks.\nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Yes, Tim, I think the way to think about our storage business is, we actually \u2013 I think you followed us. We made the pivot which we felt was more appropriate back when we closed Cavium. We added fiber channel in. We did our Analyst Day, and we really decided to talk about the business more in terms of end market orientation, enterprise and datacenter versus client just because from an R&D standpoint, that's where we invest.We look at it from an end market application point of view, not so much how much do we want to spend in X, Y, Z product line. So again, I think the commentary, I gave to Harlan, a few questions ago was probably the way you should think about it, which is we're executing well to our strategy on the enterprise and the datacenter side and that continues to grow as a percentage of our total storage, which is encouraging.On the competitive threat side, I'd say a couple of things, one is at the Analyst Day, we did about a year ago, what we said was look, we acknowledge that verticalization is occurring particularly in the client area and in particular, in the \u2013 we believe that the low end portion of the PC market was probably the place where we would see the most traction from our NAND customers, who wanted to go vertical, and we've seen that play out. Now, we weren't necessarily putting much if any R&D in that area, and so we've just been managing that trend.What we're encouraged by and that's actually why we purposely called out the product we just introduced our first 12-nanometer product is, it's a standalone controller and I would call it for the higher end of the market, but really, what we are able to leverage is for the DIY opportunities.It's the same process node, same IP set just customized very specifically for an application and that market and that business this DIY concept, which was really more of a concept actually, when we first talked about in 2017 that become real, and now we're even saying in Q3 of next year, we expect a sharp revenue ramp as a result of that business model catching on in the cloud and beyond.And I think that trend, we're going to continue to see and we look like a really good choice there because the end customers want a supplier who actually has deep experience working with other people's NAND. And so when you \u2013 if you are end OEM and you wanted to get a NAND supplier with their own controller team to go start working with everybody else's NAND that probably isn't going to happen because nobody really wants to share their inner workings of how their product interoperate.So we think the DIY trend is real, it's growing in importance to us. And so we're going to take a standard product approach that gets us the IP we need so we can go do that. But to the extent we can produce a standard product out of it, that's got broad market appeal that can fit certain swim lanes or SKUs of our end customers where they don't have the capability or the capacity of the design team internally to do it than we would be a good supplier.So the bottom line as we see our SSD business growing through DIY and others on an ongoing basis from starting at this point going out through next year and beyond, driven by some of these trends that I articulated.\nTimothy Arcuri: Awesome, Matt. Thanks so much.\nMatthew Murphy: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question comes from Chris Caso of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nChristopher Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. First question is regarding the Fusion radio head win that you talked about, if you could give a little more color on that and assuming that's incremental to the revenue run rates you're running in 5G right now, and perhaps talk about some timing and magnitude of when that ramp occurs?\nMatthew Murphy: Yes. Sure, Chris. So the way to think of it is we had a customer take our prior generation fusion and because of the architecture and the scalability of the programmability, right they were actually able to implement it and go into production fairly quickly, and so that's in our current run rate model today.Just to clarify the next-gen that we won adds more functionality, and so as a result, actually is a higher ASP, so when that product kicks in, which would be in the early part of 2021 in production, I mean, we're going to get the whole development done in calendar 2020. So when that ramps in calendar 2021, certainly there is some incremental revenue to us.What I would say is the dark horse is what's the adoption of massive MIMO going to be. And I think to the extent that massive MIMO does better that's certainly going to be an opportunity. And then beyond that, this is a trend we see. So this wasn't just one customer who had their own kind of concept about how to do this.We very much see the trend of purpose-built optimized silicon in the radio head not only at the customer that we're engaged with today, but at multiple other customers and including a very strong engagement we have already with a second customer today to do something very similar. So it's a trend we see it, and we think we're very well positioned to take advantage of it with future design wins beyond our lead customer with this type of architecture.\nChristopher Caso: Thank you. And as a follow-up on the Aquantia business, you talked about getting back to $100 million revenue run rate in that business. Is that just a function of the customers burning off the inventory and getting back to normal shipments, and what are the prospects of growing that business beyond the $100 million level?\nMatthew Murphy: Yes. Chris, I think it's a combination. One is inventory digestion and getting back to a normalized run rate. And then the second is, is new design wins that Aquantia had already secured prior to the acquisition, their pipeline was pretty strong. When we acquired them, and certainly, I think it goes without saying with the reception for the combination has been very strong both by the enterprise customer base as well as the automotive customer base.I mean in the enterprise side, the view is it creates a much stronger scaled up PHY team with best-in-class technology from both Marvell and Aquantia, and we've got that team fully integrated now under Faraj's leadership. And on the automotive side, where we have really by far the most compelling end-to-end portfolio from all the way from 100-megabit PHYs to roadmap to 10-gig and beyond over copper with switches and multiple configurations, port counts and a substantially scaled up R&D team to go deliver to what that market needs.So I think, I'd just say it's a combination of wins that they already had, new wins we're getting, and then certainly the inventory correction that a lot of folks went through from the first half to the second half that certainly plays itself out as well as we head into the end of the year here.\nChristopher Caso: Got it. Thank you.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Ashish Saran for closing remarks. Sir?\nAshish Saran: Thank you, everyone for joining us today, and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming Barclays Technology Conference in San Francisco.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I will start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter, which includes a partial quarter results from the Aquantia acquisition, which we closed on the 19 of September. As a reminder, the guidance provided on the 29 of August for the third quarter did not include any contributions from the pending Aquantia acquisition. Revenue in the third quarter was $662 million versus our guidance of $660 million at midpoint.Networking represented 50% of our revenue in the third quarter, with storage contributing 43%. Revenue from our other business was $45 million in the third quarter below expectations and declined 14% sequentially. Other products accounted for 7% of revenue.GAAP gross margin was 51.3%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $421 million or 63.5% of revenue at midpoint of our guidance range. GAAP operating expenses were $402 million.Non-GAAP operating expenses were $283 million, slightly above the midpoint of guidance due to the closure of Aquantia acquisition within the quarter. Without the impact from the Aquantia acquisition, non-GAAP operating expenses would have been below the low end of guidance.Our current level of OpEx reflects a lower level of bonus accrual. GAAP operating loss was $62 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $138 million or 21% of revenue. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.12. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.17 at a midpoint of our guidance.Now turning to the balance sheet. In the third quarter, we returned $40 million to shareholders through dividend and then we exited the quarter with $438 million in cash and cash equivalents. Long-term debt was $2 billion, an increase of approximately $350 million from the prior quarter. The increase was from drawing down our revolving credit facility for funding acquisition of Aquantia.Inventory increased to $68 million from the prior quarter, $31 million of the increase with from the Aquantia acquisition including the accounting fair value step up. The balance of the increase was to support the expected growth of our 5G business.Let me now move on to our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, which include the expected results from the Aquantia and Avera acquisitions for the full quarter. This guidance also includes expected results for the full quarter from the Wi-Fi business.Once the sale of the Wi-Fi business is completed, we will update the revenue portion for our guidance for the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our revenue in the current quarter to remain impacted by the U.S. government's export restrictions on certain Chinese customers.Specifically, we expect revenue to be in the range of $750 million plus or minus 3%. We anticipate our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 45.5% and our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 62%. Avera is a cover out from GlobalFoundries and that we have a certain one-time transition cost that are expected to negatively impact our gross margin in the fourth quarter.We expect our gross margin to return to more than 63% once we complete the divestiture of Wi-Fi business and a fully integrate Aquantia and Avera into Marvell supply chain. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $445 million to $455 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $315 million to $320 million.We expect net interest expense to be approximately $26 million. As a reminder, at the beginning of our fourth quarter, we financed the acquisition of Avera with a $600 million bridge loan, and this increase in debt is reflected in our guidance for interest expense. We anticipate GAAP loss per diluted share in the range of $0.17 to $0.23 and the non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.15 to $0.19.Before we open the line for questions, let me make a couple of longer-term comments on operating expenses expectations given we have a few moving parts from three transactions. First, due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes, merit increases and the reset of bonus accruals from the current low level, we expect our non-GAAP OpEx in the first quarter of next fiscal year to grow by approximately 5% on a sequential basis.Second, we have quickly started to integrate both Aquantia and Avera and the ERP integration have been largely completed, enabling a faster start toward synergy achievement. We will continue to drive the remaining synergy achievement and the operating efficiency improvement through fiscal 2021, while investing in a growth initiative to position us to deliver long-term profitable growth.Once we complete the divestment of Wi-Fi business and the fully integrated Aquantia and Avera, we expect OpEx to decline through the rest of fiscal 2021 from the Q1 high point I just outlined. As a result, we project our non-GAAP operating expenses in Q4 next fiscal year will be approximately $300 million.Operator, please open the line for Q&A. Thanks. Yes. Vivek, it's actually quite straightforward. If you think about our operating expense guidance for Q4, which include both Aquantia and Avera for the full quarter, which also include the Wi-Fi business. So moving forward, if we end up closing the Wi-Fi sale in our Q4, the best way to think about it is, I also guided you Q4 next year, the OpEx is going to be $300 million without Wi-Fi business.So a simple way to think about this, that's how we're going to migrate. We're going to have a merit and bonus increase reset in Q1, but we're going to absorb those increase by improving efficiency and achieving additional synergies. So you can largely view the difference between Q4 this year, and the Q4 next year. It's the difference, it's the Wi-Fi business getting out. Okay, great. So Q3, Q4 is actually when you think about that is Q3 our OpEx is about $280 million without any acquisitions. We actually achieved the significant amount of the synergy right at the beginning of the two acquisitions. So the two acquisitions probably add about $37 million of OpEx. That's why the Q4 midpoint of OpEx guidance is the current level.So the way to think about it is $280 million step up because of the two acquisitions. And then when you get into Q1 next year, of course, we're going to have the Wi-Fi business coming out if we close the transaction. But at the same time the OpEx will stay around the same level because that 5% sequential increase from the merit and the bonus reset. So if you think about gross margin, right the two major drivers are revenue level and the product mix. We are quite confident once we complete the Wi-Fi divestiture and the fully integrated two acquisitions that we should get to about 63% very quickly, but then beyond that really is going to be driven by revenue level.When our revenue level recover, it helps that you pull out gross margin further about that level, and of course, product mix is another one. Typically, we'll see how the product mix goes each quarter, but we are quite confident we'll be able to drive the gross margin about 63% quickly probably in Q1 next quarter \u2013 next fiscal year and go beyond that. On the OpEx side, I think really \u2013 you're absolutely right, when you look at the bonus reset and merit to increase the payroll tax all added together in Q1. That's the 5% sequential increase that we discussed, but then we'll take down that OpEx to the $300 million level access in Q4 fiscal 2021. Yes. Okay. Gary, I'll try to give you some color. We're certainly not guiding next fiscal year, but typically the way to think about our revenue seasonality without Wi-Fi business is Q1, sequentially versus the Q4 they will be slightly low single-digit decline that's just regular seasonality.And then when you migrate into Q2 will increase slightly. I think the most important thing in the second half as Matt mentioned, we have some very significant revenue drivers, so that related to our own product cycle despite overall normal seasonality or macroeconomic situation, those drivers are coming from the 5G from DIY SSD solutions. So those things are going to drive our revenue significantly higher in second half. So that's the only color I can give you right now. I think the right way to think about this, what we gave to you guys before right. This business operated around the $300 million revenue with some seasonality and gross margin around the 50%. So that's what we provided in the past. Yes. Tim, thanks for the question. I think in the longer-term, we are quite confident we will continue to drive the gross margin expansion with the combined portfolio. Especially, we are very much focused in the infrastructure market as Matt mentioned, we have very broad portfolio.Overall, as I said earlier, gross margin impacted by both level of revenue and the product mix. When we recover from the current revenue level and continue to expand, especially with our 5G ramp and other new product cycles unique to Marvell in the second half next year, we do see with the revenue level going up that will help improve our gross margin and the progress is toward that target level.On the operating margin side, we continue to focus on operating margin expansion. So our focus is definitely is the same operating margin target like before. We continue to manage the SG&A costs to make sure it's below 7% of revenue, and R&D, the investment is very important for us to drive the longer-term profitable growth, and so we continue to invest in our business. So once our revenue level going up, our model is highly leverageable, we will get to our operating model quickly."

            "content": "Great. Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. As a reminder, we closed the acquisition of Aquantia in our third fiscal quarter, so our consolidated results include a partial quarter of results from their operations as well.During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we delivered solid results and achieved $662 million in revenue. Our GAAP loss per share was $0.12, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.17 at the midpoint of guidance. Our storage business grew sequentially and we had better-than-expected results from our networking business. While we cannot influence the macroeconomic environment, I am very happy with our execution on the things we do control. Earlier this year, we discussed a number of significant design wins for our products in 5G base stations, enterprise switches, automotive Ethernet, and datacenter storage.In the third quarter, we continue to add to this growing list with more wins which I will discuss later in the call. Our engagement with customers continues to strengthen, which is becoming evident in our success in winning high value sockets in all our target markets, which we expect to drive sustainable growth over many years.In fact, one of our important growth drivers has already started to benefit us and I am very pleased that we shipped a significant amount of our 5G products in the third quarter, helping our key customer rapidly rollout base stations for the initial wave of 5G deployments in Korea. Of course, this is just a start of 5G deployments and we are looking forward to a lot more growth from 5G in the longer-term.More recently, we closed the acquisition of Avera on the first day of our fourth quarter. The acquisitions of Aquantia and Avera are very strategic to broadening our semiconductor solutions portfolio for our infrastructure customers. We are well on our way to integrating both teams within our networking business, and I would like to extend a warm welcome to all the new employees who have joined the Marvell team.We also expect to complete the divestiture of the Wi-Fi Connectivity Business to NXP in the first half of this month. However, as we currently still own the Wi-Fi business, my comments today on revenue expectations for the fourth quarter, include a full quarter of expected results from that business.I'd like to take this opportunity to personally thank the 600 dedicated employees in that business for their years of service to Marvell and for staying focused through this transition. We wish them all the best.Now moving on to the performance of our two core businesses. First, in our networking business, revenue during the quarter was $330 million, flat sequentially as compared to our expectations of a low single-digit decline. This improvement was split between partial quarter contributions from the Aquantia acquisition and organic Marvell businesses.During the quarter, macroeconomic uncertainty continued to impact demand from the enterprise end market. Additionally, as expected, demand for our Wi-Fi products declined seasonally. In contrast, our embedded processors delivered double-digit sequential revenue growth, driven by strong 5G shipments.As you may recall in the early part of this year, we had anticipated the start of initial production for our 5G products in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. However, last quarter, we announced that we were able to start production in the third quarter. Our key customer requested very aggressive delivery timelines to meet their commitments supporting 5G rollouts in Korea.Outstanding execution by our engineering and operations team, allowed us to rapidly ramp production and successfully deliver 5G products in volume within the third quarter itself. This was also very impressive demonstration of the maturity of our platform and quality of our NPI process that enabled us to transition from sampling our new 5G processors in the first quarter to driving a production ramp shortly thereafter.The third quarter was just the start of the 5G ramp for us as it was driven primarily by a single region. We expect these initial deployments in Korea to continue to be the main driver for our 5G revenue for another couple of quarters and we should start to see the benefit from other geographies later in fiscal 2021.By the time we approach the second half of next fiscal year, we expect a strong increase in our 5G-related revenue driven by continued Korea deployment and the start of 5G adoption in Japan and other countries such as the U.S. as they start to install 5G base stations in higher volumes.In addition, we expect to start production of baseband processors for our second Tier 1 base station customer in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 further adding to our overall 5G revenue ramp.Our progress to date has also enabled us to engage with them in longer-term technology roadmap discussions. The broadening adoption of our 5G platform is a testament to the advanced capabilities of our multi-core embedded processor portfolio further complemented by our Ethernet switch and PHY products. And we now have added Avera's full custom ASIC capabilities, enabling us to offer an industry-leading 5G suite of technology.But before I move on to the Avera acquisition, let me spend a couple of minutes on the unique capabilities of our OCTEON-embedded processor platform. As you may recall, OCTEON was the first multi-core processor architecture with a complete set of on-chip hardware accelerators for networking applications. Since then the OCTEON platform has been widely adopted for control and data plane processing across a broad range of networking applications, including base stations, switches, routers, broadband access and firewall appliances.This platform now scales up to 48 optimized ARM cores and includes hardware optimized packet processors, crypto engines, virtualization support and a wide variety of network interfaces. Our Fusion baseband processors are built on the same proven OCTEON architecture, adding baseband specific hardware accelerators and DSP cores.An important benefit for OCTEON and Fusion customers is the ability to reuse the entirety of their sizable control and data plane software investment as they design in our products across their portfolio. The software reuse not only speeds our customers development cycles, but also creates very sticky designs for Marvell.Our OCTEON and Fusion family include fully programmable ARM & DSP cores, enabling an extremely flexible and scalable architecture further optimized by implementing certain fixed functions and hardware acceleration blocks.The speed, simplicity and scalability of the OCTEON programming model has been a key differentiator and an important driver for the adoption of our processors in multiple applications. In addition, as processing spreads into new domains and base stations, such as the radio head, customers are also turning to our processors for new functions.As an example, as we discussed earlier this year, one of our customers adopted our existing Fusion baseband solution from massive MIMO processing. This represented their fastest route to market as their software was already up and running on the OCTEON architecture and the Fusion implementation was flexible enough to extend to their massive MIMO application. Longer-term, customers will often require a customized OCTEON Fusion processor optimized for specific applications, such as the complex Beamforming needed for massive MIMO.I am pleased to announce that we now have been awarded such a design win by a key customer for a Fusion-based solution customized for massive MIMO processing in the radio head. The additional complexity in the solution is also enabling a higher ASP than our existing baseband products.In addition, we are driving a fast time-to-market by leveraging the flexibility in our processor platform and expect to complete development in under one-year allowing us to start ramping this product into production by the beginning of calendar 2021. We are also in advanced discussions with the second customer for processing solutions for massive MIMO.Moving onto Avera. The combination of Avera and Marvell creates an infrastructure ASIC powerhouse with the scale and design flexibility leading wireline and wireless OEMs are looking for from their semiconductor partners. Kevin O'Buckley, who is Avera's General Manager has joined Raghib's team and will be leading the ASIC business for Marvell.In addition to Kevin, we are fortunate to be adding multiple key leaders from Avera who along with the talented global Avera team bring a tremendous amount of industry experience and technical capability. This team originally part of IBM's Microelectronics business brings a proven track record of delivering a large number of highly-complex ASICs to very demanding customers.In terms of revenue, we continue to expect that Avera will contribute approximately $300 million in annual revenue next fiscal year. A significant amount of Avera's revenue is from the wireless infrastructure market primarily for digital front-end ASICs and radio heads which aligns extremely well with Marvell's expanding presence in base stations. The base station revenue from Avera will be an addition to the organic Marvell opportunities I discussed earlier.We estimate that Avera brings an incremental $4 billion to Marvell's addressable market across the datacenter, carrier, enterprise and automotive end markets. Avera's design capabilities coupled with our broad technology platform will allow us to leverage our combined IP portfolio across the full spectrum of custom, standard and semi-custom solutions. We also expect to benefit from a broader combined customer base.As I mentioned earlier, we have now added Aquantia's leading multi-gig Ethernet products to Marvell's broad switch and PHY portfolio, extending our reach in both the network, infrastructure and the rapidly growing automotive Ethernet market.Faraj Aalaei, who is Aquantia's CEO has joined Marvell and taken on a broader role has the General Manager for all our Ethernet products, including automotive. Faraj brings a tremendous amount of industry experience and we're looking forward to working with him and his team. We have already integrated roadmaps to create a very compelling end-to-end Ethernet connectivity portfolio and in fact the combined Marvell and Aquantia team have already secured their first major design win together.This win was for a multi-gig Ethernet PHY in a Tier 1 networking OEMs campus switch platform, and we expect to start ramping production in the second half of next fiscal year. In addition, the response from multiple automotive customers to the combined company roadmap has been very strong and we are jointly working on additional opportunities to add to the 16 design wins Marvell has already won across a broad range of OEMs.From a revenue perspective, macroeconomic uncertainty impacted Aquantia's revenue in the first half of Aquantia's fiscal year as their key customers reduced purchases to better master inventory with demand. With the acquisition now complete, we expect to grow this business to approximately $100 million in annualized revenue in fiscal 2021. In fact, Aquantia's revenue was already started to recover from their June quarter on a run rate basis.Turning now to the growing ecosystem for ARM-based compute in the datacenter. At the Supercomputing Conference in Denver, we announced the availability of NVIDIA GPU support for ThunderX2-based server platforms to provide HPC and cloud customers with a powerful solution for exascale computing.In addition, we recently announced that Microsoft has started to deploy servers based on Marvell's ThunderX2 server processors for internal Azure development workloads. We believe that this is an important milestone on the path to the broader adoption of ARM-based servers across the Azure platform. The progress of ThunderX adoption at our cloud and HPC customers gives us confidence and expecting revenue growth next fiscal year from our server processors starting from a base of low initial volumes and then continuing to ramp in the second half.As we look beyond the datacenter server market, we are also seeing multiple opportunities to leverage our ThunderX processor cores in SoC or ASIC solutions for applications requiring embedded high-performance compute engines.Moving onto our outlook for the fourth quarter for our networking business, driven primarily by full quarter contributions from Avera and Aquantia, we expect an approximate 25% sequential increase in networking revenue. We are expecting revenue from Aquantia products to continue to recover from the low point they reported earlier this year.For the rest of Marvell's networking business, we expect 5G shipments to remain strong, while demand from the enterprise end market remains weak, including a decline from a number of Chinese customers.As you may recall in prior quarters, we had indicated that these customers appear to be building inventory to guard against any future potential supply chain disruptions. As a result in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we are anticipating a sequential decline from that elevated run rate, in addition to general end market softness. We are also projecting the Wi-Fi business to decline seasonally in the fourth quarter.Turning to our storage business. Storage revenue for the third quarter was $288 million, growing 5% sequentially. As expected, this growth was driven primarily from the enterprise and datacenter market. However, we did experience weaker than expected revenue from the edge market, with a softening in demand from gaming and video surveillance.We also continue to see a rapid conversion from HDDs to SSDs in the PC market, which presents a headwind for our client business. Despite challenges from current trends in the client and edge markets, our strategy to focus on the enterprise and datacenter market, including a strong position in high-capacity cloud drives, continues to payoff to drive growth for the overall storage business.Last quarter, we introduced the industry's first PCIe Gen 4 SSD controller based on a 12-nanometer process. This product delivers higher performance in a lower power envelope in a space optimized package to enable our customers to develop smaller form factor solutions. In addition, our solution also allows customers to eliminate DRAM from their SSDs, which also reduced the size and power while lowering their bill of material.Multiple customers, including several NAND OEMS are deeply engaged in evaluating our product as it uniquely addresses a number of their emerging mainstream SKUs where they need to balance performance and power in a small form factor solution.This PCIe Gen 4 architecture is also the basis for our customized SoC flash controllers for embedded and do-it-yourself applications. Our first major DIY design at a Tier 1 system level OEM is in the final stages of development. We expect a sharp ramp in revenue from this product in the third quarter of next fiscal year when our customer begins mass production of their system.Turning to the fourth quarter for our storage business. We project revenue to be flat to up slightly on a sequential basis. We expect our revenue from the datacenter and enterprise end markets to continue to grow from a strong third quarter and offset weaker trends in the edge and client markets.In closing, we continue to win new designs and position ourselves for solid growth with strong execution on new product introductions. Our 5G products have started shipping in volume, helping us offset macro weakness in other end market such as enterprise. We expect 5G base station deployments to expand into multiple geographies later next fiscal year, which we anticipate will drive a substantial increase in revenue.In addition, we continue to expand our engagement with a broad set of Tier 1 5G customers. Our storage business has stabilized, benefiting from our growing exposure to enterprise and datacenter applications and grew appreciably in the third quarter. The acquisitions of Aquantia and Avera meaningfully increased our addressable market opportunity and add the Marvell's infrastructure capabilities to create a very unique technology platform. I am looking forward to an exciting fiscal 2021.With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our results and outlook. Yes. Great. Thanks, Vivek. So I think to answer your first question, you're right. A couple of quarters ago, we articulated the $600 million number which was really the business that we had already secured design wins for. We still feel very good about that opportunity.And in fact, as we indicated in the prepared remarks, there's even been some incremental change to that on the positive side as we transition at least one of our customers to a higher ASP product in the massive MIMO area. So that tends to be tracking well in terms of the design opportunities and our customer positioning. So we're quite confident there.On Avera, what we said was about half their revenue was from the wireless infrastructure market and base stations of which a portion of that is tied to 5G. And certainly, we see that contributing as well and that would be on top of the $600 million.And I look forward to completing full quarter with Avera under our belt and then articulating the combined opportunity in the future, but it's definitely above $600 million just given the fact that Avera is bringing in pretty significant revenue in the base station market. Sure, great question. So a couple of things, so one is, I talk about in two dimensions. The first is, we've already had hit the ground running on the customer side. So there has been a pretty extensive global roadshow with the combined Marvell and Avera team to articulate our strategy for both 7 and 5-nanometer in our technology platform.We're doing this in a very targeted manner and really think about it as we're going to address. We're going to line up our IP roadmap that we've had inside the company with the end customer orientation. So we're going to go more narrow and go much bigger with a handful of large customers across those end markets I mentioned which is cloud, enterprise, automotive and also base stations and that's gone extremely well.The second is we've done already a very good job with the team, integrating the IP team from Avera and also the backend teams into one consolidated Central Engineering effort. So when we hit the ground running on our next-generation process technology platform, we're going to have one platform that we can leverage for our ASIC business for our semi-custom business and for our standard product business.And that's resonating very well with the customer base. I think they wanted to see us actually bring the team together quickly and have one integrated offering. And I would say the feedback has been phenomenal from the roadshow in terms of interest from all those end markets that I mentioned. Sure. Yes, I know it ramped up and it ramped up fairly steeply, which was positive, it's going to probably remain certainly from a Korea standpoint, it will keep deploying at that level. And then we see continued momentum as our customer deploys in other regions and within those other regions, other carriers within those regions. And certainly even in the Korea market, I think the best is still in front of us, if you look at subscriber penetration, which has been very fast in Korea. I think to-date, it's around 15% of total subscribers around 5G and certainly that's going to trend significantly higher next year.So I think of it as sort of the first step is Korea's ramps and it's going to stay strong for the next few quarters and then we anticipate additional regions kicking in, in the outer quarters with what looks to be a very strong second half as 5G really picks up momentum and our design position should enable us to participate in that. Yes. Sure. Thanks, Ross. Let me talk about them in two distinct pieces because they are a little bit different. I think on the China side what we signaled was we did see inventory being built. I think, primarily due to concerns about restrictions from an entity list point of view, and we had signaled that over the last couple of quarters, we saw it happen and we called out that we now see the \u2013 we see that reflected in our Q4 outlook, which is that inventory had been built in Q3 and that was not going to continue into Q4.So that's sort of a separate geo political issue on the enterprise market relative to the broader enterprise market. We certainly were impacted. Last quarter, we did signal that we had a slowdown in the outlook fairly close to the call. That's continued. And I think if you just look at the commentary in general, out of the market. I think most of the large companies selling into the enterprise are continuing to have a weaker outlook primarily due to the macro.And I think the way we look at it is, certainly there is some \u2013 if you look at United States that while the consumer is strong, I think the business environment tends to be fairly cautious and until there is maybe more clarity on some of the trade related issues or there is some conclusion, it's going to continue to remain choppy and so that's what we're seeing currently.I'd say \u2013 I'd end this whole thing by saying at the same time, because of our \u2013 the investments we made in some of these new emerging areas and candidly the teams very strong execution on our new product development, we've been able to offset some of this weakness and 5G was one example. This past quarter, which we expect to continue, but we also as we said in our prepared remarks, we see multiple growth drivers heading in the next year, which even with a weaker macro we think our product cycles will carry us through. Thanks, Gary. Yes. Just to make sure I got this, you're really saying hey beyond Korea for our lead customer, what is the deployment look like, and then what is our content relative to maybe some of those different regions? Did I get that right, C.J.? Yes. So I think the way to think about it is, first, just on the content side, this tends to be one platform. The only differences I would note is to the extent that in certain regions that massive MIMO is deployed more extensively, then that's certainly a positive thing for us because we have more content in those radio heads. And as I mentioned, we already have some content today in radio heads and in the future we would have in a more customized purpose built solutions.Beyond Korea, we see certainly Japan deploying next year. A lot of that's driven by the country hosting the Olympic Games. Certainly, for those of us here in the United States, you can see the pretty strong momentum among the various carriers about their plans to deploy 5G and that's probably more robust later in 2020.I think there is certainly with respect to the device side, there is a slew of devices out there, but the sort of the Holy Grail that people have in mind is when there is an iPhone 5G and to the extent that that the timing of that product becomes clear, I think we certainly think that that will help overall adoption of 5G and drive demand for the service, probably very similar to when the product initially came out and made the transition to 3G, that drove a big cycle and we've seen cycle subsequently from 3G to LTE to 5G.So I think there is a number of positive data point, certainly we get more and more encouraged about the adoption of the technology. And then there are other things going on. There is a spectrum licenses in India and other countries, and I think we're just going to see a continued sort of evolution of various countries around the world deploying, but for us it's really Korea, Japan, United States and then to some extent depending on when India decides to kick in.Our lead customers always had a strong presence in that region. But again, content, you should assume unless there's some very high adoption of massive MIMO in a particular region should be very similar to the numbers we've been talking about. Well, what I'd say is and what's resonating well is that the \u2013 across all of \u2013 quite frankly our combined Tier 1 5G customers and base station customers is that our end-to-end portfolio and our offering is second to none, okay. I mean, there is not another company that has all of these various pieces under one roof, right from Baseband IP to transport processing IP, front haul connectivity. Obviously, DFE, now we're getting very strong DFE experience and capability from Avera and plus some of the massive MIMO efforts we're putting in.So that I would say across the board has resonated extremely well that entire data chain being able to be provided by Marvell, and so certainly we're engaged both with the Avera customer base as well as the Marvell customer base and presenting it as one unified strategy.There is no specific update on an existing customer, but I will say just having brought Avera on board, recently, I mean we've already gotten RFQs from several customers that \u2013 new customers for Avera right and we're bringing those Marvell relationships and so we're still early days, but certainly to be effectively a month in and be already engaged in these types of discussions is very encouraging to me. Yes. Sure. So let me give a big picture first, and then we can give \u2013 frame our opportunity. So I think one positive thing certainly out of the Super Computing Conference this year and you can even look as recently as the last couple of days with Amazon's events. It's pretty clear that the ecosystem for ARM-based server class CPUs continues to grow.I mean, certainly in the couple of years, we've had the business or even less. There has been a tremendous progress there and so we look at it, one, as a positive that there is a number of different solutions, now they are coming to market. The partnership with NVIDIA, it's been significant. And I think the ability to go work interoperate with them, certainly in the exascale type of opportunities is a big deal.We were pleased to announce that we progress on the Microsoft front and that we put out the joint press release and we certainly see that those deployment starting initially in the early part of next year and then ramping in the second half. I think it's a little bit early to call the size and the slope. But clearly, we're encouraged that we've gone through the gauntlet of qualifications and joint development there over the last couple of years, it's been a great partnership, and we are looking forward to this ramping into production in the second half.And I think everybody knows the sort of size of the server CPU market is deca billions of dollars. I mean at our own Analyst Day, we said the subset of that that we were going after was probably in the range of $4 billion or so of SAM, just as a subset. So it still remains a big opportunity, still lucrative, but we'll probably give more color as we approach production ramps to be able to give you a sense of what that looks like. Yes. Thanks, Joe. Sure. Well, thanks for the question. So I think the way I'd frame it at a high level, is if you look at our lead customer and I noted some of the statistics about how fast we were able to bring them to production. And just the overall, development cycle time. I think that was one compelling reason why we were chosen.And the second opportunity was really the confidence in the team's ability to dramatically improve the historical cycle times of getting these types of ASICs out in general in the base station market. And so we've got some really strong proof points I think and we're executing extremely well to the aggressive schedule that we had committed to upfront for the second customer. We certainly approved our team's capability to the extent that people want to try to go earlier than we would certainly do everything we could.We are currently on track to sample the product, tape out sample production in line with what we've been saying and that's currently the plan of record. But we're always very sensitive when our customers want to go faster and to the extent that they \u2013 we could mutually align and that we would, but at this point, we are committed \u2013 we already committed to pretty aggressive schedule to begin with. And so that's what we're sticking to.On the second part of the question. At least so far the \u2013 because the partnership has been strong and the engagement and we've been delivering to what we said. Anytime you do that with the customer it opens up opportunities. And so again, you kind of nailed it between OCTEON for the transport, full ASIC capability for DFE and the ability to add even some Marvell IP and their massive MIMO Ethernet front-haul connectivity, it's a pretty compelling portfolio.So we're hopeful to continue to win more business across the board and certainly, the best way we can do that is live up to our promises and execute really thoroughly to what we commit to, and that's what we're intending on doing at least with this current opportunity. Sure. Yes, I think you nailed the growth drivers pretty well and certainly, I think the effort candidly that we put in over the last three years to really repivot the storage business and focus on the cloud and enterprise and get those design wins and get them \u2013 products developed and get them ramped that's all starting to play out, and that's helping offset what we see is pretty continued weakness both in the client side.I think there's been some pretty well-telegraphed challenges on the CPU front in terms of ability to build enough notebooks that hasn't helped anybody certainly the drive companies, and the end OEMs. I think also the export restrictions in the bands relative to some of the Chinese OEMs and the video surveillance area. Clearly those video surveillance cameras and devices have a tremendous amount of storage attached to them, and that's also got some impact that's a derivative impact. We don't sell directly into those companies, but we sell to drive companies that may or may not have business there and that's certainly a weakness too.So I think, we see these edge and client markets being fairly soft and then offsetting it or even in the case of Q3 more than offset it was strong growth on these product cycles and the tailwind that you mentioned. And so what we're going to continue to do is continue to execute our strategy. We've been putting all of our R&D efforts into the markets that are growing today, and where we can control our destiny on research and development and product execution, we will. Some of these other things like PC CPU shortages or government bans on, it's hard for us to influence those. All we can do is manage around it, and where we can control our destiny. Yes. Sure. Yes, Tim, I think the way to think about our storage business is, we actually \u2013 I think you followed us. We made the pivot which we felt was more appropriate back when we closed Cavium. We added fiber channel in. We did our Analyst Day, and we really decided to talk about the business more in terms of end market orientation, enterprise and datacenter versus client just because from an R&D standpoint, that's where we invest.We look at it from an end market application point of view, not so much how much do we want to spend in X, Y, Z product line. So again, I think the commentary, I gave to Harlan, a few questions ago was probably the way you should think about it, which is we're executing well to our strategy on the enterprise and the datacenter side and that continues to grow as a percentage of our total storage, which is encouraging.On the competitive threat side, I'd say a couple of things, one is at the Analyst Day, we did about a year ago, what we said was look, we acknowledge that verticalization is occurring particularly in the client area and in particular, in the \u2013 we believe that the low end portion of the PC market was probably the place where we would see the most traction from our NAND customers, who wanted to go vertical, and we've seen that play out. Now, we weren't necessarily putting much if any R&D in that area, and so we've just been managing that trend.What we're encouraged by and that's actually why we purposely called out the product we just introduced our first 12-nanometer product is, it's a standalone controller and I would call it for the higher end of the market, but really, what we are able to leverage is for the DIY opportunities.It's the same process node, same IP set just customized very specifically for an application and that market and that business this DIY concept, which was really more of a concept actually, when we first talked about in 2017 that become real, and now we're even saying in Q3 of next year, we expect a sharp revenue ramp as a result of that business model catching on in the cloud and beyond.And I think that trend, we're going to continue to see and we look like a really good choice there because the end customers want a supplier who actually has deep experience working with other people's NAND. And so when you \u2013 if you are end OEM and you wanted to get a NAND supplier with their own controller team to go start working with everybody else's NAND that probably isn't going to happen because nobody really wants to share their inner workings of how their product interoperate.So we think the DIY trend is real, it's growing in importance to us. And so we're going to take a standard product approach that gets us the IP we need so we can go do that. But to the extent we can produce a standard product out of it, that's got broad market appeal that can fit certain swim lanes or SKUs of our end customers where they don't have the capability or the capacity of the design team internally to do it than we would be a good supplier.So the bottom line as we see our SSD business growing through DIY and others on an ongoing basis from starting at this point going out through next year and beyond, driven by some of these trends that I articulated. Okay. Thanks. Yes. Sure, Chris. So the way to think of it is we had a customer take our prior generation fusion and because of the architecture and the scalability of the programmability, right they were actually able to implement it and go into production fairly quickly, and so that's in our current run rate model today.Just to clarify the next-gen that we won adds more functionality, and so as a result, actually is a higher ASP, so when that product kicks in, which would be in the early part of 2021 in production, I mean, we're going to get the whole development done in calendar 2020. So when that ramps in calendar 2021, certainly there is some incremental revenue to us.What I would say is the dark horse is what's the adoption of massive MIMO going to be. And I think to the extent that massive MIMO does better that's certainly going to be an opportunity. And then beyond that, this is a trend we see. So this wasn't just one customer who had their own kind of concept about how to do this.We very much see the trend of purpose-built optimized silicon in the radio head not only at the customer that we're engaged with today, but at multiple other customers and including a very strong engagement we have already with a second customer today to do something very similar. So it's a trend we see it, and we think we're very well positioned to take advantage of it with future design wins beyond our lead customer with this type of architecture. Yes. Chris, I think it's a combination. One is inventory digestion and getting back to a normalized run rate. And then the second is, is new design wins that Aquantia had already secured prior to the acquisition, their pipeline was pretty strong. When we acquired them, and certainly, I think it goes without saying with the reception for the combination has been very strong both by the enterprise customer base as well as the automotive customer base.I mean in the enterprise side, the view is it creates a much stronger scaled up PHY team with best-in-class technology from both Marvell and Aquantia, and we've got that team fully integrated now under Faraj's leadership. And on the automotive side, where we have really by far the most compelling end-to-end portfolio from all the way from 100-megabit PHYs to roadmap to 10-gig and beyond over copper with switches and multiple configurations, port counts and a substantially scaled up R&D team to go deliver to what that market needs.So I think, I'd just say it's a combination of wins that they already had, new wins we're getting, and then certainly the inventory correction that a lot of folks went through from the first half to the second half that certainly plays itself out as well as we head into the end of the year here. Yes."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's conference call is being recorded for replay purposes.It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Head of Investor Relations at Marvell. You may begin.\nAshish Saran: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Marvell's second quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell\u2019s President and CEO, and Jean Hu our CFO.I want to remind everyone that certain comments today may include forward-looking statements which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and which could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations.Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements.During our call today we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our website in the Investor Relations section.With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance.\nMatt Murphy: Thanks Ashish, and good afternoon everyone. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020 Marvell delivered solid results with revenue above the midpoint of guidance despite the challenging macroeconomic environment creating weakness across severe end markets and the impact from the current export restrictions on Huawei. We expect both of these factors to continue to impact us in the third quarter, but as we'll discuss we remain well positioned to capitalize on infrastructure opportunities spanning 5G, data center, enterprise and automotive applications as we look forward to our next fiscal year.Specifically revenue for quarter was $657 million with a GAAP loss per share of $0.09. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.16 slightly above the midpoint of our guidance driven by the higher revenue level and lower operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses were $397 million, $22 million above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $280 million $8 million below the midpoint of guidance.We are continuing to prudently manage expenses as we navigate the industry downturn. Keep in mind this expense level reflects the complete realization of synergies we sought to capture from the Cavium acquisition, plus the incremental cost savings we outlined in December of last year. I'm pleased to report that we delivered these expense reductions two quarters ahead of schedule. This achievement is a testament to the operational platform we have established within Marvell and the disciplined approach we have implemented as part of our transformation, enabling us to aggressively invest in high-growth areas even within a smaller expense envelope.Our integration track record will serve us well for the upcoming acquisitions of Aquantia and Avera as well as the divestiture of our Wi-Fi business to NXP. As we look forward, we are preparing for significant new product ramps within our infrastructure markets, particularly 5G, providing strong growth catalysts in secular positive offsets to the weakness across the broader semiconductor industry.Before I discuss our core businesses, I would like to provide an update on Marvell's executive team. Recall that back in May, Tom Lagatta our current Head of Global Sales announced his decision to retire later this year. I'm very pleased to announce that we are promoting Dean Jarnac to Senior Vice President and Head of Global Sales for Marvell.Dean joined us in 2017 as our VP of North America sales and Global Distribution and previously held positions of increasing sales responsibilities for Samsung, Broadcom, Freescale, Altera, and AMD. Dean is an ideal candidate to assume the strategic leadership role given his demonstrated success in building strong customer partnerships and managing global organizations. He will be an invaluable addition to our executive team.I would also like to recognize Tom for the enormous contributions he made in the transformation of Marvell. Tom joined us at a critical juncture and built a strong global sales team, including the recruitment and mentoring of Dean. We wish Tom all the best as he returns to retirement.Now, moving on to the performance of our two core businesses; first, in our networking business revenue during the quarter was $330 million down 3% sequentially with seasonal growth and Wi-Fi products more than offset by the U.S. Government's export restrictions on Huawei and the pause in demand from our base station OEMs as they transition from 4G to 5G.More importantly, I am very pleased to report that strong execution by our engineering and operations teams coupled with a very close relationship with our lead customer is enabling us to launch our first 5G products which include our Fusion baseband and OCTEON Embedded Processors and our Ethernet switches and PHYs into production in the third quarter ahead of plan.This early production start gives us and our customer further confidence in ramping up in the fourth quarter. In fact our 5G silicate is enabling our lead customer to deploy trial base stations this quarter in Tokyo to light of their Olympic village in preparation for next summer's games. Additionally, we're on track for our customer to start deploying Fusion processors for Massive MIMO offload in remote radio heads in the fourth fiscal quarter.Even more exciting, we have secured another strategic design win at our lead customer with our follow-on baseband solution in the next technology process note to provide additional processing capacity within the smaller power envelope for their next generation 5G base stations. This win builds upon our very successful multiyear partnership where we provide advanced baseband processors enabling our customer to drive higher performance, lower power and faster time-to-market.In addition, Fusion baseband development for a second Tier 1 base station OEM is also proceeding on schedule, and remain on track to sample early next fiscal year and ramp production at the end of next fiscal year. Based on the design wins we have secured so far and using industry analyst forecasts for base station units, we are holding our customers market share at the current positions, we estimate that in a few years our 5G revenue potential can exceed $600 million per year.Of course our revenue potential can flex above this if our lead customer is able to gain share as they drive towards their long-term goals and from additional design wins which we are currently pursuing within our comprehensive 5G platform to address baseband, transport, switching, front-haul and Massive MIMO opportunities at multiple base station OEMs.Further, next calendar year is expected to be the inflection point for 5G adoption with industry analysts such as [indiscernible] projecting 5G macro-base station penetration to grow from about 10% this year to rapidly increase to 38% next year, and then on to 55% in calendar year 2021.Moving on from base stations to our enterprise and data center markets, our revenue grew sequentially driven by stronger-than-expected demand from our Chinese customers who have not been impacted by export restrictions. However, these markets have remained generally soft. Therefore we believe that some of our relative strength could be due to these customers building inventory to guard against any future supply chain disruptions.Nevertheless, on the new product front our refreshed Ethernet products continue to win new designs which will drive multiyear growth. Our PHY team had a very strong quarter with multiple design wins in three separate platforms at a Tier 1 U.S. networking OEM. These include Gigabit and 10 Gigabit copper PHYs for a very high-volume enterprise access switch, 25 Gigabit optical PHYs for a high-capacity enterprise access switch and 56 Gigabit PAM4 optical PHYs for an enterprise aggregation switch.Equally exciting, I am happy to announce the first strategic design wins for our 12.8 Tb switch platform which we had introduced earlier this year. The switch will be powering a next-generation firewall appliance from a Tier 1 networking OEM and we have also secured an enterprise aggregation switch at a large Asian networking OEM. These PHY and switch wins will go into production late next fiscal year with the bulk of the ramp starting in fiscal year 2022.In our automotive product line, as you may recall, earlier this year we had announced design wins for 16 automotive OEMs spanning Europe, North America and Asia. We have now started the initial ramp of our gigabit Ethernet secure switches and PHYs to some of these OEMs for their upcoming model year 2020 rollouts and expect to grow more substantially next fiscal year when we ramp the remaining majority of these design wins in support of model year 2021 launches.These multiple design wins were secured across a variety of applications including infotainment, ADAS, telematics, central gateway and body domain controllers. The investments we made to establish in-house automotive grade capabilities are now starting to pay off and we recently achieved a key qualification ASPICE level 2, an important software process development certification tailored specifically to the auto industry for developing high-quality embedded systems. This represents a key differentiator versus our primary automotive Ethernet competitors.We believe that our technology investments, which will be further enhanced by the multi-gig capabilities from the upcoming acquisition of Aquantia to have positioned us to become the leader in the automotive Ethernet connectivity market. This market is projected to grow rapidly from a low base today to well over $0.5 billion over the next several years. The steep trajectory is not driven by automotive unit growth, but rather by the growing proliferation of high-speed in-vehicle networks, connecting the increasing number of sensors and cameras for driver assist and higher levels of autonomy as well as richer infotainment and more advanced telematics offerings.The coming increasing bandwidth and the sheer number of endpoints which need to be connected and shared will require secure standards-based Ethernet fabric designed for speed and scalability. In a few years we believe that the overall automotive market can become another substantial growth engine for Marvell. In addition, the Ethernet connectivity we see opportunity to leverage additional technologies such as our processing, security and custom design capabilities in the automotive market.Moving on to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect a low single digit sequential decline in networking revenue. This outlook reflects softness in demand from the enterprise networking end market due to current macroeconomic conditions and in particular a recent significant forecast reduction from a key enterprise networking customer as well as the seasonal decline in Wi-Fi, partially offset by growth from our base station products driven by the start of our 5G production shipments.Turning to our storage business, storage revenue for the second quarter came in above our expectations at $275 million declining 1% sequentially better than our guidance for mid single-digit sequential decline. As expected, our storage business was impacted by the export restriction on Huawei. But we benefited from stronger-than-expected demand from a broad set of storage controller customers in the HDD, SSD and fiber channel end markets. It appears that previously elevated inventory levels have slowly started to subside at some our storage controller customers.We also believe that PC build picked up in the second quarter with better CPU availability and that demand for high-capacity nearline drives also stabilized. Growing our revenue from the enterprise and data center market is a key strategic objective for Marvell and to that end we are now shipping in multiple nearline platforms with capacities up to 16 terabytes. In addition, I am also pleased to announce that we now have a design win in the next generation platform targeting even higher capacity points, well under the 20 plus terabyte range.Our storage controller team had a very strong showing at the recently concluded Flash Memory Summit, or FMS where we introduced two breakthrough products and NVMe over Fabric Ethernet SSD controller and a family of PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD controllers. We've demonstrated both of these products as well as a additional technology solutions including artificial intelligence SSDs, fiber channel over NVMe and centralized automotive storage at this premier industry event.Our Ethernet SSD controller enables an SSD to directly connect to an Ethernet network without the need to go through a host such as a server. This disruptive new data center architecture significantly reduces cost by eliminating power-hungry CPUs, smartnet [ph], DRAM and PCIe switches while also reducing latency, increasing throughput and lowering downtime due to SSD failures. These controllers fully integrate with Marvell's data center Ethernet switches and their introduction marks a key milestone in advancing our end-to-end Ethernet storage strategy.Also at FMS Toshiba Memory showcased the world's first direct to Ethernet SSD, their dual ported 25 Gigabit Ethernet solution leveraging Marvell's Ethernet SSD controller technology. Our new NVMe SSD controllers represent the industry's first PCIe Gen 4 SSD controllers to be fabricated on a 12 nanometer process which consumes lower power while delivering better performance.Multiple ecosystem partners including AMD, Lenovo, Micron and Toshiba Memory have expressed very strong support for these new products. More importantly, these controllers provide the core architecture for upcoming embedded in do-it-yourself custom SOC flash controllers which we expect will start ramping late next fiscal year.Moving on to our outlook for our storage business in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect an increase in demand for our storage controllers from the data center and enterprise markets, especially from high-capacity nearline drives and some additional catching up in the SSD market from the under shipment in prior quarters. Demand for fiber channel adapter should also trend up in the third quarter.In contrast, demand for HDDs for PCs in gaming is expected to remain soft with some seasonal growth for this part of the fiscal year. As a result, we expect an approximate high single-digit sequential growth in our third quarter storage revenue.In closing, while we remain in a very challenging macroeconomic environment, which has certainly worsened recently and has impacted our guidance for the third quarter, we continue to focus on things we can control. We are wining the designs, optimizing operating expenses, introducing new products on or ahead of schedule, and expanding our product pipeline. It is particularly exciting to see the production of our first 5G products accelerated into the third quarter faster than prior expectations. Of course we expect our 5G business to ramp more substantially in the fourth quarter and well into our next fiscal year from new 5G base station deployments in multiple geographies.In addition, we also expect to benefit from our customers starting to replace FPGAs with our purpose built 5G solutions in the pre-5G base stations they have already shipped. At the same time our storage business is starting to recover and we are increasingly pivoting this business towards enterprise and data center applications. Further with the Aquantia and Avera acquisitions Marvell is well-positioned to capitalize on the broader set of opportunities leveraging our unique standard, semicustom and full ASIC design capabilities towards realizing our vision of becoming one of the world's leading suppliers of infrastructure semiconductor solutions.With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our results and outlook.\nJean Hu: Thanks Matt, and good afternoon everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 20120. Revenue in the second quarter was $657 million versus our guidance over $650 million at midpoint. Networking represented 50% of our revenue in the second quarter, with storage contributing 42%. Other product revenue was $52 million and accounted for 8% of the total company revenue. After strong second quarter we expect other products revenue to decline sequentially in the third quarter.GAAP gross margin was 53.4%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $450 million or 63.3% of revenue reflecting the change in mix within the quarter. GAAP operating expenses were $397 million, $22 million above the middle point of our guidance driven by acquisition and the divestiture related expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $280 million below the guidance range you provided in May.As Matt discussed earlier, we were very successful in achieving our planned expense reductions two quarters ahead of schedule. Non-GAAP operating profit was $136 million or 21% of revenue. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.09. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.16 slightly above the middle point of guidance driven by higher revenue and lower expenses.Now turning to our balance sheet. In the second quarter we returned $56 million to shareholders through $60 million in share repurchases and $40 million in dividends. We exited the quarter with $573 million in cash and cash equivalent and a long term debt of $1.7 billion. We have paused share repurchases and debt reduction while we worked hard with closing the acquisitions of Aquantia, Avera as well as the sale of our Wi-Fi business to NXP. And we currently anticipate all of these transactions to be completed within our previously communicated timeframe.Given the ongoing uncertainty in end markets, we actively reduced the channel inventory in the second quarter and are planning on doing the same again in the third quarter with an aim of reducing channel DOI [ph] two weeks below our target level.Let me now move on to our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Please note that this guidance does not include any contributions from the pending acquisitions so far Aquantia and Avera as well as to the divestiture of Wi-Fi business. Similar to last quarter's outlook we expect our revenue in the kind of period to remain impacted by the U.S. Government's export restriction on Huawei.Specifically, we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $660 million plus or minus 3%. We anticipate our GAAP gross margin will be approximately between 53.5% and 54.5%. Our non-GAAP gross margin will be between 63% and 64%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $385 million plus or minus $5 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $280 million plus or minus $2.5 million which at the middle point will be similar to the prior quarter.We continue to maintain tight control for discretionary expenses given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment. We expect interest expense to be $20 million. As a result we anticipate GAAP loss per diluted share in the range of $0.09 to $0.05 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.15 to $0.19.Operator, we are now ready for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question and thank you for all the updates on 5G. Matt, I had two question, first on 5G, I think you mentioned you are starting to ship to your lead customer a quarter ahead. I assume that's just a partial quarter ramp and then the real ramp should be in January and longer term, I think you gave a $600 million or so opportunity is that just with the lead customer or does that include your entire 5G opportunity with multiple customers?\nMatt Murphy: Great, thanks for that. Yes, I'll answer both of those. So I think you are right. Q3 is definitely a partial quarter and it is the initial production. Originally we had been signaling going back some time that we would have this initial production in the first quarter, so we were able to pull some in which is I think a great achievement where our operations team and design teams have done a fantastic job. So we'll get some shipments in Q3 with the ramp full quarters worth of contribution in Q4.And then on your second question, the $600 million is the all in number, that's with you know think of it as our lead customer, plus our second customer, plus factoring in other opportunities that we see in the pipeline and of course we said depending on base station units and percentages of share of our customers, it could go higher, but again the way to think of it is the $600 million is what we can, what we won so far and then anything that we can get this above and beyond that on some of these new opportunities we're pursuing would be incremental.And again, just to be clear, this is a run rate number we believe is achievable over time, so this isn\u2019t something that's going to start like next quarter as an example, but over time we believe once these all roll into production it will be a substantial revenue driver for the company.\nVivek Arya: Got it, and for my followup on the storage side, sales are down about 30% from the peak quarterly level. I realize that there is a Huawei effect in there, but what does recovery look like for storage? Do you think revenues get somewhere in between where you were at the peak versus where you are at right now and what would be the catalyst for recovery? And let's say if you don\u2019t see the recovery path in storage are there other strategic alternatives that need to be considered? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Okay, got it. Yes, so I think at a high level it is difficult to give you a precise answer, so I think it is probably what you said, which is it is somewhere in between. I mean obviously we're taking this one quarter at a time. I think the positives we see certainly in the short term is that is business appears to have stabilized after having dropped fairly precipitously for us as well as the rest of the industry and obviously guiding up sequentially in Q3 is a positive sign.So I think, even in my commentary, to follow the short-term which is at least we're seeing some positive signs, but and we do expect by the way that as we look into next year, when you sort of asked for catalysts, I think one is, obviously we're going through this inventory rationalization at the customer base, but we also have new design wins and new programs that we're in. I alluded to the traction in nearline as an example, which are programs that are currently in production as well as next-generation. I think that's going to benefit us heading into next year, as well as the new opportunities in SSD that come out of this do-it-yourself framework that we've discussed as well.So I think there is some sort of general recovery, plus we do have new design wins and traction. And as a result, I think on your third question, the storage remains to be an extremely important business for us. It's a profitable business. It's one where we have strong technology leadership and market position, and we have a lot of customers that are counting on us to keep delivering the solutions that we are.So we're investing in this area and we do see it as an important part of the Marvell story having really compelling offering of storage, networking and compute or processor assets that from a system point of view are very important to our customer and offers a breadth that really very few to none of our competitors can provide.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Karl Ackerman with Cowen. Your line is now open.\nKarl Ackerman: Good afternoon, Matt and Jean. Two questions from me as well, please. First, you indicated in your prepared remarks that you received some earlier shipments of 5G products in the October quarter, or in the upcoming October quarter. How much 5G revenue do you expect in the October quarter? And what is the expected ramp within the January quarter? And I guess from a qualitative perspective, what's the right way to think about your 5G opportunity over the next few quarters?\nJean Hu: Karl, I'll answer the near-term question, Matt can add about the future of 5G. So, we just started post production shipment. So you shouldn't expect, it's a very - it's small revenue in Q3. Certainly, we expect that Q4, you will see the sequential ramp from the 5G product line. In the longer term, Matt, you can probably can give more longer term. We talk about the $600 million few years the opportunity. Of course, it would take time from the initial ramp to get to that $600 million annual run rate. So that's - hopefully that gives you some color about the near-term and the longer-term view.\nMatt Murphy: Yes, sure. And maybe I'll add to that, Karl, as you think about qualitatively how do you think about this business heading into next year. I think the first is, the base station for percentage of shipments as I highlighted even the external analysts who got a range of estimates, but they're all kind of converging, that's going to grow significantly next year, it's probably 10% of base stations this year, it will be north of 30% maybe 40% next year.So that's one positive. Deployments for us with our lead customer are going to really be for new base station shipments deployed in Korea. Obviously, Japan is going to deploy. There is a lot of activity there. It's being one of those catalysts and also the United States.Second, there are shipments that are going to ramp up as well, where there is going to be replacement of the existing line cards that are installed today that are based on discrete solutions that are going to get replaced for our optimized solutions. So that's also going to be kicking in. And then of course you have starting at the end of next year, that our second customer coming online.So we see it as a layering effect and the timing of all of these pieces, you know, it's really hard to nail them down exactly. This is a fast-moving and dynamic market, but you should expect that in calendar year - next calendar year this business should ramp up very quickly.\nKarl Ackerman: That's helpful. One last question, if I may. I'm curious what your own view is on the campus networking upgrade cycle for your core switching PHY business. I mean, should we assume that the growth opportunity is more nascent, or is the October quarter lull a transitory event? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes, I think we should separate it into two pieces. I think one is, what's the business conditions today and there is clearly a pause and a slowdown going on driven by a lot of effects, which we've seen both from the effects that with - while they obviously, as well as recent announcements from large U.S. networking OEMs as well.So I think that, that's sort of out there, that's the current environment. We remain very bullish on our design win, capture that we've had, that business and again prior to the downturn we were growing that enterprise in campus switching in PHY business, fairly robustly.So while we see a short-term pause, mostly driven by the macro issues, the pipeline and the design win momentum is actually continue to accelerate and whether it's our new 12.8 switch platform, which is a brand new market that we're servicing, the fact that we've gone from basically announcing that product earlier this year to now being able to say we've actually secured design wins that are going to - go into production, I think that's very positive.On the switch side and on PHY side, I highlighted a number of examples in my prepared remarks. So I would just kind of separate the two. Currently there is clearly a lot of weakness in the market, and a lot of choppiness, but we believe when that settles down our design win position is going to be - continue to be very strong and drive longer term growth once we're back to a normal situation.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Your line is now open.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey Matt, I just wanted to ask, first on the 5G market, when you announced your second customer win, you've talked about the possibility of winning at additional customers beyond that. And just wondering if you could give us any update on wins beyond your first two customers, is that opportunity still out there? Has it gone away? Just any update you could provide on sort of opportunity on your first two customers.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. So nothing formal to announce today, or I would have called it out in my prepared remarks, but what I would say is the activity level, not only with our two kind of lead customers, but also beyond that is quite robust right now. I mean, the fact that we've got strong offerings now in baseband, in transport, in massive MIMO, which was something that really wasn't there sort of earlier this year, front-haul solutions and then obviously with Avera coming in, the DFE [ph] capability and radio solutions.I think our - and then to add on top of that request to continue to improve and kind of optimize our Ethernet switch products is that part of the base station the connectivity continues to evolve. We have a lot of design activity and it's not limited just to one or two customers, it's really limited. I mean it's really much broader than that across a lot of different technology. So design win opportunity is the pipelines are very large right now. And there's a lot of activity and that's how we would characterize it.So, hopefully we continue to be successful here and we can announce sort of the realization of some of these wins as we go forward, but it's - we're pretty excited about our technology line up, because we really have all the key pieces that our customers are looking for.\nQuinn Bolton: Great and then just on the storage side at Flash Memory Summit a few weeks back you guys announced your new, I think Gen4 PCIe controller that was DRAM less and allowed fewer number of channels, so smaller die size. And I'm just kind of wondering, as you look at the launch of that new controller, does that have a negative ASP factor and negative margin effect is, we're thinking about the SSD business going forward, or do you think that, that new product comes in, it's similar margins to - that the business historically?\nJean Hu: Hi, this is Jean. So the new product launch we are very excited about, is the gross margin, it's actually very similar. Our team has done tremendous work to really try to design to optimize the design, the performance to make sure we continue to drive to get to the value for IP for our design for our expertise. So I would say in general you should expect us to have very similar gross margin in our SSD and HDD market.\nMatt Murphy: Yes, and I'll just add, and we actually highlighted that this product is in 12-nanometer, so we actually are leveraging both our architectural experience, as well as process technology leadership, which we've had for some time in the SSD area and we kind of continue to push the envelope there. So that obviously, couple of the time-to-market advantage ends up being a good situation with respect to margins in the kind of value you can deliver, so.\nQuinn Bolton: Great. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. My first question is on the networking side. In your prepared comments you kind of called out two things; one, China's strength in the data center that you might think is inventory-related, which I think we do believe you are trying to stay on the right side of conservative. I'm just kind of curious if you can kind of size what you think that might be. And as you looked out to the - in the fiscal third quarter guidance whether or not you're still embedding strength there?And then secondly, you also mentioned within the guide a single networking customer where you saw sort of a downward revision in their orders. I think you don't want to get too specific about customers today, but any more color you can give around what's going on there is that something which feels pretty transitory? Is it a reflection of just macro uncertainty, or is it something else going on? And then I have a follow-up.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. No problem, John. So I think you captured it right on the dynamics and networking high-level, obviously very choppy here. On the first part of the question, on the China strength, I mean, we're fairly detailed and how we look at our demand in particular a lot of the China business gets realized through distribution.So we did see very strong POS, and as we've double clicked through it a number of these customers seem to be ordering a lot more than they normally would. And so a couple of things there; one is, it's not a huge number. So just to size it it's not an enormous number, but still we felt it was appropriate to call that out.I would say also the way we're managing our channel is very much with that in mind. So just to give you a sense, I mean, we've actually we're running our distribution days of inventory about two weeks below our target levels right now, just bearing in mind that, if there is some inflation in the POS that we're going to be on the right side of that. So that's happening there.Again, hard to pinpoint, but we think that's what's going on. And then on the second one, that the situation we called-out, I mean it's definitely something that's kind of evolved recently. So we've seen this sort of situation develop over the last several weeks and obviously preparing for our guidance. We've had to really assess that situation.So it's hard to say. I mean, I think you have to look at the broader commentary out there in the market from what our end customers are saying, but if you look back, I'll just make one final comment, when - if you go back to the beginning of this down cycle, we were fairly early there because of the way we reported and also our exposure to storage to see a lot of this weakness fairly early, and so that first leg down if you remember earlier this year was in storage. I was followed by a compute leg down talking about industry-wide where servers have weakened.And I think a lot of investors had asked us, are we going to see that in networking and while we don't predict that far out. We definitely see from our lens, the networking business also now being weak. So that's sort of the deal, I think - I think I've answered the China and the large customer one.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. That's really helpful, Matt. And then just as my follow-up, I was a little confused by your answer to Vivek about the recovery in storage, not predicting when you get back to next cycle peak, but if you exclude the vacancies of what goes - cyclical vacancies of the storage market, especially given some of your new product launches and re-positioning, refocusing of the business, is there any reason why at some point, you don't get back to where you were the last cycle peak? Has your view of the growth rate of this business longer term changed at all?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, sure. Now look, yeah, I think it's worth clarifying then, John. So the simple way to think about it is, and again, understanding we have momentum in that business from a new design win point of view on the markets I mentioned. But if you look at the PC exposed portion, we did a pretty good job on the kind of the first transition I would say, when HDD was converting the SSD. And if you remember over the last few years we've sort of manage that HDD going down by winning new designs in SSD.We've said even going back to our Analyst Day that, that remaining HDD to SSD conversion and notebooks, which is typically at the lower end. When that conversion happens we're probably not going to benefit from that. We really haven't put a lot of R&D into that area, that's a kind of a lower end client opportunity in our mission is really been around enterprise and data center.So I think that's when I look at sort of the gap, which you maybe get back to peak and when, I think we've got that headwind and that's sort of we've been very transparent about that one. Again though being offset by even next year, we are very confident in our ability to ramp up our new do-it-yourself solutions in SSD, some of those will be forthcoming.And then in the nearline programs we won, which we believe we're well-positioned on both 16-terabyte and then even going to 20-terabyte and beyond. Our design win footprint is actually quite strong. So that's the puts and takes. And again, I'm being very careful to not call a complete sort of trough to peak on this one or peak to trough, but we do see that business clearly recovering how high it gets back up to - we need to kind of take this one quarter at a time.\nJohn Pitzer: Perfect. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just two on 5G actually. You mentioned that you sampled your chip, and it's actually in trial now. I was wondering if you could just walk us through that timeline is there anything else you have to do from on your side from a silicon perspective. And then you mentioned a follow-on generation, if you could just for - when would that starts to kick-in?And then I just wanted to revisit, you said greater than $600 million. I think most people kind of thought about 4x of content like you've talked about. And if you just take the two customers that kind of get there and you've talked about some incremental wins.So, it maybe just kind of walk through that $600 million and I know it's greater than $600 million, but I'm just kind of curious, it seems like you're getting every call added wins and there is still opportunities of incremental customers. So if you could just comment on opportunities above that $600 million would be helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. So on the first one, which is really two parts. With respect to ramping on 5G and what still needed there, yeah. Those products are - they're done. We're going to be able to ship them this quarter. There is certainly a lot of work there with respect to getting the yields where we want on the production ramp, I mean, I'm saying this, because I don't want my team to come back to me and say, you made it sound so easy. This is a very challenging ramp for our company.But from a silicon perspective for the first shipments we're - that part is done. So now it comes down to execution and how fast we can ramp and matching the demand signals from our customer set positive. The second one is, we did win - the next generation product which we're very pleased about, that takes us down in the advanced node process area, which is a very big positive, I think for our customer as well as just for us.But that's the design that's going to be kicking off now. So think of it is, we've got very sort of solid runway on our current generation of products to last us at least for the next several years. And so, again this is just really a testament to the fact that we've continue to engage well with our lead customer. We've got the roadmap in place with them.The $600 million just to kind of set the stage. I think on - first, we felt it was appropriate to just talk about it, because we have lot of questions from investors on this. And so, I think the baseline case is really you can sort of take the lead customer, you can use the 4x increase in content, right, and that would get you to roughly call it $400 million or so. You would add the potential contribution from our second customer on to that. And then obviously there is more of that could come later.And then the timing of all of these things are still to be determined. So we're trying to establish what base case would look like Blayne, but certainly for the broader investor community, we get this question all the time and we felt that it would be better to just get that out now. But you should assume these are the wins that we are - if we achieve them would layer on top of that number.\nBlayne Curtis: Excellent.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nGary Mobley: Thanks for taking my question. A question about Aquantia. Jean, I think, will you mention Aquantia's revenue run rate normalized at the time of the acquisition announcement of around $100 million. Most recently per the 10-Q filing from Aquantia, their revenue is around $9 million. Is that just inventory digestion, or did you feel differently about that business being above or below or at $100 million mark?\nJean Hu: Thanks Gary for the question. So as you probably have seen from a Aquantia's 10-Q filing, they are key customers of Aquantia's, they have been reducing inventory. So that's why it has a significant impact of Aquantia's revenue. Frankly, we think it's a great operational discipline to really balance the inventory and the supply-demand to make sure you are really being on the inventory at the customers.So that has always being Marvell's practice, we typically really don't have inventory at the customers unless they need it. So that process is ongoing. I would say, Aquantia team continue to win designs and also they have been ramping up new designs with key networking customers.So, we actually, really are quite comfortable. Once this inventory adjustment period ends and going into next fiscal year, which is our fiscal '21, they should be able to ramp back to the $100 million per year run rate we articulated during the deal announcement. So we feel pretty good about that. And our team, they are doing the integration planning and everything we have seen is quite consistent with what our deal assumption has been. So we'll give you more update when we get closer to the deal closure.\nGary Mobley: Okay. Thank you for that. And in the other category, the products within that, I believe you've communicated our - and a long-term decline, but certainly had a good first half of fiscal year 2020. And so, can you just speak about the strength and what's driving the growth and maybe any sort of update on your long-term expectations for that business?\nJean Hu: Oh, yes. So it's about our other revenue category, so let me start by saying, right. This product category include our printer business and some of the other consumer-related business. Those business actually have a very long tail, it would last for multiple years. But it could be very lumpy because sometimes the customer wants to have a last time buy.So that's what happened in Q2, you actually sell that product line increase in revenue, that's because of a last time buy. In general, the way you should think about it or model it is, in the longer term, you should see the high single-digit year-over-year decline lasted for many years going forward. So that's how you should think about modeling this business going forward.\nGary Mobley: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Mr. Seymore, your line is now open. Please check your mute button.\nJean Hu: Hey, Ross.\nMatt Murphy: Let's move to the next question please.\nOperator: Absolutely, out next question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks and let me ask a question on - good to see the quarter-over-quarter resumption in your storage business, but it still looks like you guys are shipping about 13% to 15% below normal consumption levels. I know that more of the headwind for Q3 is client storage, but on nearline, it also seems that the mix shift in the second half of this year is more towards 14-terabyte platforms where your competitor has more controller share and less so maybe to the 16-terabyte platforms where you guys have a strong position. So has the slight mix shift also moderated your view on the slope of the recovery of the storage business kind of second half of this year?\nJean Hu: Yes. So I appreciate your question. So the way to think about our storage business, you're right, we have been under shipping the market and our storage business, when you look at it overall, I appreciate the question about the 14-terabyte versus 16-terabyte and our position going forward on 16-terabyte and above certainly is much stronger. But overall, when you look at the dynamics of our storage businesses actually we continue to see just a stabilization, not like a significant pick up. So we are looking at it quarter-by-quarter like Matt said earlier.And overall, the way to look at it is actually the data center and the enterprise, which include both HDD and SSD solutions, you should see that revenue continue to go up in the second half and also going into next year. But as far as the dynamics for 16-terabyte, 14-terabyte, actually right now at this point, it's - the revenue is relatively lower percentage. So it's actually not impacting the overall revenue dynamics.\nHarlan Sur: Okay, thanks for the insights there, Jean. And then - and a question for you, Matt. Can you just give us an update on the cloud hyperscale qualifications on ThunderX2, your ARM-based server platform? And are you still on track to ramp some of these customers in the first half of next calendar year? And then on ThunderX3, your 7-nanometer platform, I know you guys take this chip out. Is it back from the fab? Have you started sampling this product? Any early performance metrics you can share with us?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, great. Thanks for the question. So, yes, no update on X2 from what we said before other than those calls that we referenced before are proceeding as we had outlined before, right. So that's something that we do expect to ramp up next year. And with regards to X3 and performance data, these products actually have a quite a long cycle time and it's going to take us some time to really provide that information. So I don't have an update there for you at this time.\nHarlan Sur: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Tim Arcuri with United Bank of Switzerland. Your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hey this is John calling in for Tim, that's UBS Securities. Anyway, thanks for taking my question. I'm just kind of wondering about the China's strength that you see from customers not Huawei, kind of wondering was that isolated to this past quarter or when do you start seeing that, I'm just trying to get a gain some kind of knowledge on when that might have started where there is starting to pull in orders a lot earlier than last quarter?\nMatt Murphy: Hi, John. So, yes, it's kind of interesting. I mean, if you actually go all the way back and you look at even the end of last year when the tariffs were announced there was unusual customer behavior in China that even started that right and you may remember this, but we had one quarter in our Q3 a year ago where we said our networking business was up like Marvell core networking was up by 29%year-over-year, which we had said basically looks like this. People pulling and so there has been a lot of, a lot of disruptive activity going on given all the trade tensions and macro issues in China.Specifically this latest go around I would say we saw that during the second quarter. I'd say we saw the POS accelerate in the customer pulls. But you should just kind of assume right around the time that Huawei was put on the entity list, I think that triggered some additional ordering from the customer base there in terms of being worried about supply chain disruption.So that's probably the time frame. But I just wanted to bound it, it wasn't like hey sort of showed up, I don't know if there's just been a lot of noise in the China market as a result of the trade tensions that are going on with which are obviously widely publicized and documented on a daily basis.\nJean Hu: So, John, just as Matt mentioned earlier right is do the first two exposure for us, this is a channel business and the China channel business. So it's a very small percentage of our revenue. And also as Matt mentioned earlier, we have been really prudent to manage channel inventory and it took down channel inventory significantly really two things through with this kind of and the market behavior. So I think it's a small exposure for us, but it is an interesting phenomenon.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Yes, thanks for that. Thanks for the color. My follow-up and one that's the 5G business or what you expect coming into 2020. I know in the last 4G generation. I mean, order rates were always pretty lumpy. I'm sure is going to be like that for the 5G but in initial ramp into 2020, what are you guys seeing or what can you guys guess going into 2020?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, it's, I mean, John, it's too early to call that slope. I think another caller was asking sort of the same thing. At this point, we just need to stick to more qualitative, because as I mentioned, there is a dynamic where there's multiple countries deploying, there is our customers to be able to get share in those countries. There is some replacement opportunity we're going to get. We got a second customer coming in, and you're right, I mean the carrier business historically for all suppliers is a lumpier business.So you have to layer some increased volatility on top of that. So as a result, it's difficult to give you this ramp at this point, John, but certainly as we get through Q4 and we're looking out into the next fiscal year, I think we'll be in a better position certainly lining up with our customer and the market on what's happening. But just to be clear, I mean calendar 2020 for us is going to be a very strong year. There is no question, when it fully ramps and what quarter by quarter, I think we are too early to call that one.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: You are welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with Bank of Montreal. Your line is now open.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Hi, thank you. Thank you, Matt. I apologize for any background noise. I had a question on the networking business on a reported quarter. You talked about the 4G pause as customers transition to 5G, so the question really is, is there a bottom to that 4G that we should be thinking about, what is the mix of the 4G within the networking? And so we are all focused on the 600, but is there a cannibalization going on of the 4G, so the net-net is not really 600 and is 600 minus whatever that business is, which is yet to stabilize? And then I had a follow-up.\nMatt Murphy: Sure, yes. So I think the way to think about is, kind of point one is and we sort of called this out at the Analyst Day last year. Today, the current 4G carrier business for us is not a big business right and that's one reason we're excited about 5G because obviously with the content growth and then all the dynamics associated with that.So today, that's not a terribly large business, and I don't think the way to do it is try to figure out how much 4G we're still shipping versus how much 5G because 4G is almost gone if you think about it, because all the new systems were in at our lead customer pretty much all their new shipments once we're ready to go, even if they're not ready to light up 5G yet, they'll ship as a 4G base station.So that's why we've just sort of gone to this model to say, look the business run rate was X amount before and kind of its normal four quarter average, let's call it, and then you just take the average content increase and that's where you get the $400 million from.So, I don't know if that's helpful. But it's not a one that I think, we spend a lot of time on in terms of because one, it wasn't a big business for us and two, most of that has really slowed down in anticipation of this new ramp up, which will cover 4G in the next year.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Got it. Now, that's helpful. And I asked because you brought it up again about the slowdown or the reported quarter, but this is clear. I understand. And then my follow-up is a little bit more architectural maybe, if you could just please share your insights. You talked about FPGA replacement, just help us understand what exactly you meant and what exactly - what is going on the architectural side? Is it as simple as these products are now going into production, so the prototyping was in FPGA and now we are moving to standard products created by you? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: So I think, yes, I think you just said and I think that what we meant by that really was that and this isn't just for 5G. I mean, if I go dust it off and go all the way back to the 2G to 3G transition and the 3G to 4G transition, there is always been this wave of very strong FPGA deployments that in some cases cover baseband they cover the radio head and they cover all the major applications because the standards are changing and the OEMs are focused on time to market.And then obviously once optimized solutions become available in the standards are set then ASIC takeover. And so what we've seen is just simply that I think one is kind of qualitatively from 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G and 4G to 5 G, the percentage of conversion from FPGA to ASIC appears to be increasing, certainly because of the processing density is increasing a lot and therefore just to optimize on power and capacity and all the things that the customers and the operators care about are optimized. There is clearly a need to move to these custom solutions.But that being said, FPGAs have always been an important part of the wireless communications network design. But we are seeing very robust activity where anybody can basically leverage the IP set. We've got to go target, not just the baseband, but these remote radio head applications and obviously we have a very strong transport business which is just our embedded processor.So I hope that's helpful. It's not anything that's terribly different from the prior generations. It's just that Marvell today has of very strong offering in this area and therefore, we think we can capture a lot more share than we had in 4G.\nAmbrish Srivastava: That's very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our last question will come from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.\nRoss Seymore: Hi guys. Can you hear me this time?\nMatt Murphy: We got you Ross.\nRoss Seymore: Yes. Sorry about that last time. Lots of great questions have been asked and answered already, so I'll try to hit on two ha. So I'll try to hit on to that haven't the enterprise weakness the networking side that you talked about is that localized to one customer, or is it something broader and Matt, do you believe, it's something that's just beginning or is this kind of a macro trend that is generally along the same timing? We've seen across the weakness in most of the sectors.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. So I would say point one is it is broader and broader means obviously a number of customers, some of which are either flat or they slightly down or they just not sort of mean their forecast and then we did also call out that one of - one large customer. It was, quite pronounced in terms of the change in the demand signals and the outlook that we saw heading into this call, we had today.So it's not, - we're not signaling it's just one customer, we're saying there's broader weakness certainly from our lens. But clearly, our results and our guidance are driven mostly by the large customer just given their contribution to our overall revenue.\nRoss Seymore: That's helpful. And then maybe one for either you or Jean. You guys have been busy in this last quarter. Lots of moving parts, acquisitions, divestitures, et cetera. If we look forward, whether to a year or two years down the road, you guys before had a long-term target I think at the gross margin to be above 66 and operating margin, I think both those on a pro forma basis, about 35%.If we think about the Marvell of tomorrow, after these three deals, are those targets still on the right ballpark? Does it expedite or delay the ability to achieve those? Just kind of wanted to see longer-term, what the company is going to look like after these deals versus at the time you guys gave those long-term targets at the last Analyst Meeting.\nJean Hu: Hi, Ross thanks for the question. I think if you take a level higher to think about how we think about our business model, it continue to be the same driving principle is we really want to maximize returns for stakeholders, which means to generate a strong free cash flow, strong earnings and strong operating profit.So when we think about our long-term target model which - was set up like almost like more than a year ago, what we said is, hey the topline revenue growth that will be in the range of 6% to 8%, gross margins, it's going to be around the 66% and the operating margin 35% as you mentioned.So right now, when we look at the progress that the company has made during the last year are more than a year. We have again tremendous - momentum, than the Analyst Day in 5G, in the infrastructure market. Matt talked about each of the opportunity and upside which was now the part of the original Analyst Day. And of course both Aquantia and Avera and the WiFi divestiture, were not part for the - our internal business model.So the way we are thinking about, we can give you some perspective, but we are not updating the model. The perspective is basically on the top line. If we can drive the opportunity where have design wins and everything else in a normalized macro environment, we should see our revenue growing - call with a high end - range of our model. On the gross margin side, I think the way - first I want to say is as a company we are laser focused on gross margin improvement and you have seen us. We have had a really strong track record to improve gross margin.Going forward, there are few takes and puts for this gross margin dynamics, I think certainty storage business is stabilizing the near line that data center will help us increase of the gross margin. And also secondly, on the networking side, our automotive business, our switch 5 refreshed portfolio, they are all going to help to contribute positively to the gross margin. On the 5G side it's going to be a significant revenue driver, but some of our 5G products actually right now currently have a lower than corporate average gross margins.So the way you should expect us to do is going forward, we're laser focused now on improve the yield, the test time, because it's in the early ramp. There is certainly a maturity of production and on the yield side and test time side, which will improve gross margin.So, we continue to think, while we balance everything our gross margin should it be still very high may be in the 63% to 65% range, But overall the way to think about it is because our top line revenue growing is going to be much faster, the gross margin dollars are actually going to be much higher, which on the operating margin side that we definitely are very committed to the 35% operating margin.We do think structurally, if we can grow the revenue, our model will leverage quickly to deliver that kind of operating model. So hopefully that helps you to think through the longer term model.\nRoss Seymore: That's great detail. Thanks Jean.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today. So now it's my pleasure to hand the conference back over to Ashish Saran, Head of Investor Relations at Marvell for any closing comments or remarks.\nAshish Saran: Thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you at the upcoming Free Technology Conference in New York City and the Deutsche Bank Technology Conference in Las Vegas.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Murphy",
            "content": "Thanks Ashish, and good afternoon everyone. During the second quarter of fiscal 2020 Marvell delivered solid results with revenue above the midpoint of guidance despite the challenging macroeconomic environment creating weakness across severe end markets and the impact from the current export restrictions on Huawei. We expect both of these factors to continue to impact us in the third quarter, but as we'll discuss we remain well positioned to capitalize on infrastructure opportunities spanning 5G, data center, enterprise and automotive applications as we look forward to our next fiscal year.Specifically revenue for quarter was $657 million with a GAAP loss per share of $0.09. Non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.16 slightly above the midpoint of our guidance driven by the higher revenue level and lower operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses were $397 million, $22 million above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $280 million $8 million below the midpoint of guidance.We are continuing to prudently manage expenses as we navigate the industry downturn. Keep in mind this expense level reflects the complete realization of synergies we sought to capture from the Cavium acquisition, plus the incremental cost savings we outlined in December of last year. I'm pleased to report that we delivered these expense reductions two quarters ahead of schedule. This achievement is a testament to the operational platform we have established within Marvell and the disciplined approach we have implemented as part of our transformation, enabling us to aggressively invest in high-growth areas even within a smaller expense envelope.Our integration track record will serve us well for the upcoming acquisitions of Aquantia and Avera as well as the divestiture of our Wi-Fi business to NXP. As we look forward, we are preparing for significant new product ramps within our infrastructure markets, particularly 5G, providing strong growth catalysts in secular positive offsets to the weakness across the broader semiconductor industry.Before I discuss our core businesses, I would like to provide an update on Marvell's executive team. Recall that back in May, Tom Lagatta our current Head of Global Sales announced his decision to retire later this year. I'm very pleased to announce that we are promoting Dean Jarnac to Senior Vice President and Head of Global Sales for Marvell.Dean joined us in 2017 as our VP of North America sales and Global Distribution and previously held positions of increasing sales responsibilities for Samsung, Broadcom, Freescale, Altera, and AMD. Dean is an ideal candidate to assume the strategic leadership role given his demonstrated success in building strong customer partnerships and managing global organizations. He will be an invaluable addition to our executive team.I would also like to recognize Tom for the enormous contributions he made in the transformation of Marvell. Tom joined us at a critical juncture and built a strong global sales team, including the recruitment and mentoring of Dean. We wish Tom all the best as he returns to retirement.Now, moving on to the performance of our two core businesses; first, in our networking business revenue during the quarter was $330 million down 3% sequentially with seasonal growth and Wi-Fi products more than offset by the U.S. Government's export restrictions on Huawei and the pause in demand from our base station OEMs as they transition from 4G to 5G.More importantly, I am very pleased to report that strong execution by our engineering and operations teams coupled with a very close relationship with our lead customer is enabling us to launch our first 5G products which include our Fusion baseband and OCTEON Embedded Processors and our Ethernet switches and PHYs into production in the third quarter ahead of plan.This early production start gives us and our customer further confidence in ramping up in the fourth quarter. In fact our 5G silicate is enabling our lead customer to deploy trial base stations this quarter in Tokyo to light of their Olympic village in preparation for next summer's games. Additionally, we're on track for our customer to start deploying Fusion processors for Massive MIMO offload in remote radio heads in the fourth fiscal quarter.Even more exciting, we have secured another strategic design win at our lead customer with our follow-on baseband solution in the next technology process note to provide additional processing capacity within the smaller power envelope for their next generation 5G base stations. This win builds upon our very successful multiyear partnership where we provide advanced baseband processors enabling our customer to drive higher performance, lower power and faster time-to-market.In addition, Fusion baseband development for a second Tier 1 base station OEM is also proceeding on schedule, and remain on track to sample early next fiscal year and ramp production at the end of next fiscal year. Based on the design wins we have secured so far and using industry analyst forecasts for base station units, we are holding our customers market share at the current positions, we estimate that in a few years our 5G revenue potential can exceed $600 million per year.Of course our revenue potential can flex above this if our lead customer is able to gain share as they drive towards their long-term goals and from additional design wins which we are currently pursuing within our comprehensive 5G platform to address baseband, transport, switching, front-haul and Massive MIMO opportunities at multiple base station OEMs.Further, next calendar year is expected to be the inflection point for 5G adoption with industry analysts such as [indiscernible] projecting 5G macro-base station penetration to grow from about 10% this year to rapidly increase to 38% next year, and then on to 55% in calendar year 2021.Moving on from base stations to our enterprise and data center markets, our revenue grew sequentially driven by stronger-than-expected demand from our Chinese customers who have not been impacted by export restrictions. However, these markets have remained generally soft. Therefore we believe that some of our relative strength could be due to these customers building inventory to guard against any future supply chain disruptions.Nevertheless, on the new product front our refreshed Ethernet products continue to win new designs which will drive multiyear growth. Our PHY team had a very strong quarter with multiple design wins in three separate platforms at a Tier 1 U.S. networking OEM. These include Gigabit and 10 Gigabit copper PHYs for a very high-volume enterprise access switch, 25 Gigabit optical PHYs for a high-capacity enterprise access switch and 56 Gigabit PAM4 optical PHYs for an enterprise aggregation switch.Equally exciting, I am happy to announce the first strategic design wins for our 12.8 Tb switch platform which we had introduced earlier this year. The switch will be powering a next-generation firewall appliance from a Tier 1 networking OEM and we have also secured an enterprise aggregation switch at a large Asian networking OEM. These PHY and switch wins will go into production late next fiscal year with the bulk of the ramp starting in fiscal year 2022.In our automotive product line, as you may recall, earlier this year we had announced design wins for 16 automotive OEMs spanning Europe, North America and Asia. We have now started the initial ramp of our gigabit Ethernet secure switches and PHYs to some of these OEMs for their upcoming model year 2020 rollouts and expect to grow more substantially next fiscal year when we ramp the remaining majority of these design wins in support of model year 2021 launches.These multiple design wins were secured across a variety of applications including infotainment, ADAS, telematics, central gateway and body domain controllers. The investments we made to establish in-house automotive grade capabilities are now starting to pay off and we recently achieved a key qualification ASPICE level 2, an important software process development certification tailored specifically to the auto industry for developing high-quality embedded systems. This represents a key differentiator versus our primary automotive Ethernet competitors.We believe that our technology investments, which will be further enhanced by the multi-gig capabilities from the upcoming acquisition of Aquantia to have positioned us to become the leader in the automotive Ethernet connectivity market. This market is projected to grow rapidly from a low base today to well over $0.5 billion over the next several years. The steep trajectory is not driven by automotive unit growth, but rather by the growing proliferation of high-speed in-vehicle networks, connecting the increasing number of sensors and cameras for driver assist and higher levels of autonomy as well as richer infotainment and more advanced telematics offerings.The coming increasing bandwidth and the sheer number of endpoints which need to be connected and shared will require secure standards-based Ethernet fabric designed for speed and scalability. In a few years we believe that the overall automotive market can become another substantial growth engine for Marvell. In addition, the Ethernet connectivity we see opportunity to leverage additional technologies such as our processing, security and custom design capabilities in the automotive market.Moving on to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect a low single digit sequential decline in networking revenue. This outlook reflects softness in demand from the enterprise networking end market due to current macroeconomic conditions and in particular a recent significant forecast reduction from a key enterprise networking customer as well as the seasonal decline in Wi-Fi, partially offset by growth from our base station products driven by the start of our 5G production shipments.Turning to our storage business, storage revenue for the second quarter came in above our expectations at $275 million declining 1% sequentially better than our guidance for mid single-digit sequential decline. As expected, our storage business was impacted by the export restriction on Huawei. But we benefited from stronger-than-expected demand from a broad set of storage controller customers in the HDD, SSD and fiber channel end markets. It appears that previously elevated inventory levels have slowly started to subside at some our storage controller customers.We also believe that PC build picked up in the second quarter with better CPU availability and that demand for high-capacity nearline drives also stabilized. Growing our revenue from the enterprise and data center market is a key strategic objective for Marvell and to that end we are now shipping in multiple nearline platforms with capacities up to 16 terabytes. In addition, I am also pleased to announce that we now have a design win in the next generation platform targeting even higher capacity points, well under the 20 plus terabyte range.Our storage controller team had a very strong showing at the recently concluded Flash Memory Summit, or FMS where we introduced two breakthrough products and NVMe over Fabric Ethernet SSD controller and a family of PCIe Gen 4 NVMe SSD controllers. We've demonstrated both of these products as well as a additional technology solutions including artificial intelligence SSDs, fiber channel over NVMe and centralized automotive storage at this premier industry event.Our Ethernet SSD controller enables an SSD to directly connect to an Ethernet network without the need to go through a host such as a server. This disruptive new data center architecture significantly reduces cost by eliminating power-hungry CPUs, smartnet [ph], DRAM and PCIe switches while also reducing latency, increasing throughput and lowering downtime due to SSD failures. These controllers fully integrate with Marvell's data center Ethernet switches and their introduction marks a key milestone in advancing our end-to-end Ethernet storage strategy.Also at FMS Toshiba Memory showcased the world's first direct to Ethernet SSD, their dual ported 25 Gigabit Ethernet solution leveraging Marvell's Ethernet SSD controller technology. Our new NVMe SSD controllers represent the industry's first PCIe Gen 4 SSD controllers to be fabricated on a 12 nanometer process which consumes lower power while delivering better performance.Multiple ecosystem partners including AMD, Lenovo, Micron and Toshiba Memory have expressed very strong support for these new products. More importantly, these controllers provide the core architecture for upcoming embedded in do-it-yourself custom SOC flash controllers which we expect will start ramping late next fiscal year.Moving on to our outlook for our storage business in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect an increase in demand for our storage controllers from the data center and enterprise markets, especially from high-capacity nearline drives and some additional catching up in the SSD market from the under shipment in prior quarters. Demand for fiber channel adapter should also trend up in the third quarter.In contrast, demand for HDDs for PCs in gaming is expected to remain soft with some seasonal growth for this part of the fiscal year. As a result, we expect an approximate high single-digit sequential growth in our third quarter storage revenue.In closing, while we remain in a very challenging macroeconomic environment, which has certainly worsened recently and has impacted our guidance for the third quarter, we continue to focus on things we can control. We are wining the designs, optimizing operating expenses, introducing new products on or ahead of schedule, and expanding our product pipeline. It is particularly exciting to see the production of our first 5G products accelerated into the third quarter faster than prior expectations. Of course we expect our 5G business to ramp more substantially in the fourth quarter and well into our next fiscal year from new 5G base station deployments in multiple geographies.In addition, we also expect to benefit from our customers starting to replace FPGAs with our purpose built 5G solutions in the pre-5G base stations they have already shipped. At the same time our storage business is starting to recover and we are increasingly pivoting this business towards enterprise and data center applications. Further with the Aquantia and Avera acquisitions Marvell is well-positioned to capitalize on the broader set of opportunities leveraging our unique standard, semicustom and full ASIC design capabilities towards realizing our vision of becoming one of the world's leading suppliers of infrastructure semiconductor solutions.With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our results and outlook. Great, thanks for that. Yes, I'll answer both of those. So I think you are right. Q3 is definitely a partial quarter and it is the initial production. Originally we had been signaling going back some time that we would have this initial production in the first quarter, so we were able to pull some in which is I think a great achievement where our operations team and design teams have done a fantastic job. So we'll get some shipments in Q3 with the ramp full quarters worth of contribution in Q4.And then on your second question, the $600 million is the all in number, that's with you know think of it as our lead customer, plus our second customer, plus factoring in other opportunities that we see in the pipeline and of course we said depending on base station units and percentages of share of our customers, it could go higher, but again the way to think of it is the $600 million is what we can, what we won so far and then anything that we can get this above and beyond that on some of these new opportunities we're pursuing would be incremental.And again, just to be clear, this is a run rate number we believe is achievable over time, so this isn't something that's going to start like next quarter as an example, but over time we believe once these all roll into production it will be a substantial revenue driver for the company. Okay, got it. Yes, so I think at a high level it is difficult to give you a precise answer, so I think it is probably what you said, which is it is somewhere in between. I mean obviously we're taking this one quarter at a time. I think the positives we see certainly in the short term is that is business appears to have stabilized after having dropped fairly precipitously for us as well as the rest of the industry and obviously guiding up sequentially in Q3 is a positive sign.So I think, even in my commentary, to follow the short-term which is at least we're seeing some positive signs, but and we do expect by the way that as we look into next year, when you sort of asked for catalysts, I think one is, obviously we're going through this inventory rationalization at the customer base, but we also have new design wins and new programs that we're in. I alluded to the traction in nearline as an example, which are programs that are currently in production as well as next-generation. I think that's going to benefit us heading into next year, as well as the new opportunities in SSD that come out of this do-it-yourself framework that we've discussed as well.So I think there is some sort of general recovery, plus we do have new design wins and traction. And as a result, I think on your third question, the storage remains to be an extremely important business for us. It's a profitable business. It's one where we have strong technology leadership and market position, and we have a lot of customers that are counting on us to keep delivering the solutions that we are.So we're investing in this area and we do see it as an important part of the Marvell story having really compelling offering of storage, networking and compute or processor assets that from a system point of view are very important to our customer and offers a breadth that really very few to none of our competitors can provide. You're welcome. Yes, sure. And maybe I'll add to that, Karl, as you think about qualitatively how do you think about this business heading into next year. I think the first is, the base station for percentage of shipments as I highlighted even the external analysts who got a range of estimates, but they're all kind of converging, that's going to grow significantly next year, it's probably 10% of base stations this year, it will be north of 30% maybe 40% next year.So that's one positive. Deployments for us with our lead customer are going to really be for new base station shipments deployed in Korea. Obviously, Japan is going to deploy. There is a lot of activity there. It's being one of those catalysts and also the United States.Second, there are shipments that are going to ramp up as well, where there is going to be replacement of the existing line cards that are installed today that are based on discrete solutions that are going to get replaced for our optimized solutions. So that's also going to be kicking in. And then of course you have starting at the end of next year, that our second customer coming online.So we see it as a layering effect and the timing of all of these pieces, you know, it's really hard to nail them down exactly. This is a fast-moving and dynamic market, but you should expect that in calendar year - next calendar year this business should ramp up very quickly. Yes, I think we should separate it into two pieces. I think one is, what's the business conditions today and there is clearly a pause and a slowdown going on driven by a lot of effects, which we've seen both from the effects that with - while they obviously, as well as recent announcements from large U.S. networking OEMs as well.So I think that, that's sort of out there, that's the current environment. We remain very bullish on our design win, capture that we've had, that business and again prior to the downturn we were growing that enterprise in campus switching in PHY business, fairly robustly.So while we see a short-term pause, mostly driven by the macro issues, the pipeline and the design win momentum is actually continue to accelerate and whether it's our new 12.8 switch platform, which is a brand new market that we're servicing, the fact that we've gone from basically announcing that product earlier this year to now being able to say we've actually secured design wins that are going to - go into production, I think that's very positive.On the switch side and on PHY side, I highlighted a number of examples in my prepared remarks. So I would just kind of separate the two. Currently there is clearly a lot of weakness in the market, and a lot of choppiness, but we believe when that settles down our design win position is going to be - continue to be very strong and drive longer term growth once we're back to a normal situation. Sure. So nothing formal to announce today, or I would have called it out in my prepared remarks, but what I would say is the activity level, not only with our two kind of lead customers, but also beyond that is quite robust right now. I mean, the fact that we've got strong offerings now in baseband, in transport, in massive MIMO, which was something that really wasn't there sort of earlier this year, front-haul solutions and then obviously with Avera coming in, the DFE [ph] capability and radio solutions.I think our - and then to add on top of that request to continue to improve and kind of optimize our Ethernet switch products is that part of the base station the connectivity continues to evolve. We have a lot of design activity and it's not limited just to one or two customers, it's really limited. I mean it's really much broader than that across a lot of different technology. So design win opportunity is the pipelines are very large right now. And there's a lot of activity and that's how we would characterize it.So, hopefully we continue to be successful here and we can announce sort of the realization of some of these wins as we go forward, but it's - we're pretty excited about our technology line up, because we really have all the key pieces that our customers are looking for. Yes, and I'll just add, and we actually highlighted that this product is in 12-nanometer, so we actually are leveraging both our architectural experience, as well as process technology leadership, which we've had for some time in the SSD area and we kind of continue to push the envelope there. So that obviously, couple of the time-to-market advantage ends up being a good situation with respect to margins in the kind of value you can deliver, so. Okay. Yes. No problem, John. So I think you captured it right on the dynamics and networking high-level, obviously very choppy here. On the first part of the question, on the China strength, I mean, we're fairly detailed and how we look at our demand in particular a lot of the China business gets realized through distribution.So we did see very strong POS, and as we've double clicked through it a number of these customers seem to be ordering a lot more than they normally would. And so a couple of things there; one is, it's not a huge number. So just to size it it's not an enormous number, but still we felt it was appropriate to call that out.I would say also the way we're managing our channel is very much with that in mind. So just to give you a sense, I mean, we've actually we're running our distribution days of inventory about two weeks below our target levels right now, just bearing in mind that, if there is some inflation in the POS that we're going to be on the right side of that. So that's happening there.Again, hard to pinpoint, but we think that's what's going on. And then on the second one, that the situation we called-out, I mean it's definitely something that's kind of evolved recently. So we've seen this sort of situation develop over the last several weeks and obviously preparing for our guidance. We've had to really assess that situation.So it's hard to say. I mean, I think you have to look at the broader commentary out there in the market from what our end customers are saying, but if you look back, I'll just make one final comment, when - if you go back to the beginning of this down cycle, we were fairly early there because of the way we reported and also our exposure to storage to see a lot of this weakness fairly early, and so that first leg down if you remember earlier this year was in storage. I was followed by a compute leg down talking about industry-wide where servers have weakened.And I think a lot of investors had asked us, are we going to see that in networking and while we don't predict that far out. We definitely see from our lens, the networking business also now being weak. So that's sort of the deal, I think - I think I've answered the China and the large customer one. Yes, sure. Now look, yeah, I think it's worth clarifying then, John. So the simple way to think about it is, and again, understanding we have momentum in that business from a new design win point of view on the markets I mentioned. But if you look at the PC exposed portion, we did a pretty good job on the kind of the first transition I would say, when HDD was converting the SSD. And if you remember over the last few years we've sort of manage that HDD going down by winning new designs in SSD.We've said even going back to our Analyst Day that, that remaining HDD to SSD conversion and notebooks, which is typically at the lower end. When that conversion happens we're probably not going to benefit from that. We really haven't put a lot of R&D into that area, that's a kind of a lower end client opportunity in our mission is really been around enterprise and data center.So I think that's when I look at sort of the gap, which you maybe get back to peak and when, I think we've got that headwind and that's sort of we've been very transparent about that one. Again though being offset by even next year, we are very confident in our ability to ramp up our new do-it-yourself solutions in SSD, some of those will be forthcoming.And then in the nearline programs we won, which we believe we're well-positioned on both 16-terabyte and then even going to 20-terabyte and beyond. Our design win footprint is actually quite strong. So that's the puts and takes. And again, I'm being very careful to not call a complete sort of trough to peak on this one or peak to trough, but we do see that business clearly recovering how high it gets back up to - we need to kind of take this one quarter at a time. Sure. So on the first one, which is really two parts. With respect to ramping on 5G and what still needed there, yeah. Those products are - they're done. We're going to be able to ship them this quarter. There is certainly a lot of work there with respect to getting the yields where we want on the production ramp, I mean, I'm saying this, because I don't want my team to come back to me and say, you made it sound so easy. This is a very challenging ramp for our company.But from a silicon perspective for the first shipments we're - that part is done. So now it comes down to execution and how fast we can ramp and matching the demand signals from our customer set positive. The second one is, we did win - the next generation product which we're very pleased about, that takes us down in the advanced node process area, which is a very big positive, I think for our customer as well as just for us.But that's the design that's going to be kicking off now. So think of it is, we've got very sort of solid runway on our current generation of products to last us at least for the next several years. And so, again this is just really a testament to the fact that we've continue to engage well with our lead customer. We've got the roadmap in place with them.The $600 million just to kind of set the stage. I think on - first, we felt it was appropriate to just talk about it, because we have lot of questions from investors on this. And so, I think the baseline case is really you can sort of take the lead customer, you can use the 4x increase in content, right, and that would get you to roughly call it $400 million or so. You would add the potential contribution from our second customer on to that. And then obviously there is more of that could come later.And then the timing of all of these things are still to be determined. So we're trying to establish what base case would look like Blayne, but certainly for the broader investor community, we get this question all the time and we felt that it would be better to just get that out now. But you should assume these are the wins that we are - if we achieve them would layer on top of that number. Let's move to the next question please. Yes, great. Thanks for the question. So, yes, no update on X2 from what we said before other than those calls that we referenced before are proceeding as we had outlined before, right. So that's something that we do expect to ramp up next year. And with regards to X3 and performance data, these products actually have a quite a long cycle time and it's going to take us some time to really provide that information. So I don't have an update there for you at this time. Hi, John. So, yes, it's kind of interesting. I mean, if you actually go all the way back and you look at even the end of last year when the tariffs were announced there was unusual customer behavior in China that even started that right and you may remember this, but we had one quarter in our Q3 a year ago where we said our networking business was up like Marvell core networking was up by 29%year-over-year, which we had said basically looks like this. People pulling and so there has been a lot of, a lot of disruptive activity going on given all the trade tensions and macro issues in China.Specifically this latest go around I would say we saw that during the second quarter. I'd say we saw the POS accelerate in the customer pulls. But you should just kind of assume right around the time that Huawei was put on the entity list, I think that triggered some additional ordering from the customer base there in terms of being worried about supply chain disruption.So that's probably the time frame. But I just wanted to bound it, it wasn't like hey sort of showed up, I don't know if there's just been a lot of noise in the China market as a result of the trade tensions that are going on with which are obviously widely publicized and documented on a daily basis. Yes, it's, I mean, John, it's too early to call that slope. I think another caller was asking sort of the same thing. At this point, we just need to stick to more qualitative, because as I mentioned, there is a dynamic where there's multiple countries deploying, there is our customers to be able to get share in those countries. There is some replacement opportunity we're going to get. We got a second customer coming in, and you're right, I mean the carrier business historically for all suppliers is a lumpier business.So you have to layer some increased volatility on top of that. So as a result, it's difficult to give you this ramp at this point, John, but certainly as we get through Q4 and we're looking out into the next fiscal year, I think we'll be in a better position certainly lining up with our customer and the market on what's happening. But just to be clear, I mean calendar 2020 for us is going to be a very strong year. There is no question, when it fully ramps and what quarter by quarter, I think we are too early to call that one. You are welcome. Sure, yes. So I think the way to think about is, kind of point one is and we sort of called this out at the Analyst Day last year. Today, the current 4G carrier business for us is not a big business right and that's one reason we're excited about 5G because obviously with the content growth and then all the dynamics associated with that.So today, that's not a terribly large business, and I don't think the way to do it is try to figure out how much 4G we're still shipping versus how much 5G because 4G is almost gone if you think about it, because all the new systems were in at our lead customer pretty much all their new shipments once we're ready to go, even if they're not ready to light up 5G yet, they'll ship as a 4G base station.So that's why we've just sort of gone to this model to say, look the business run rate was X amount before and kind of its normal four quarter average, let's call it, and then you just take the average content increase and that's where you get the $400 million from.So, I don't know if that's helpful. But it's not a one that I think, we spend a lot of time on in terms of because one, it wasn't a big business for us and two, most of that has really slowed down in anticipation of this new ramp up, which will cover 4G in the next year. So I think, yes, I think you just said and I think that what we meant by that really was that and this isn't just for 5G. I mean, if I go dust it off and go all the way back to the 2G to 3G transition and the 3G to 4G transition, there is always been this wave of very strong FPGA deployments that in some cases cover baseband they cover the radio head and they cover all the major applications because the standards are changing and the OEMs are focused on time to market.And then obviously once optimized solutions become available in the standards are set then ASIC takeover. And so what we've seen is just simply that I think one is kind of qualitatively from 2G to 3G, 3G to 4G and 4G to 5 G, the percentage of conversion from FPGA to ASIC appears to be increasing, certainly because of the processing density is increasing a lot and therefore just to optimize on power and capacity and all the things that the customers and the operators care about are optimized. There is clearly a need to move to these custom solutions.But that being said, FPGAs have always been an important part of the wireless communications network design. But we are seeing very robust activity where anybody can basically leverage the IP set. We've got to go target, not just the baseband, but these remote radio head applications and obviously we have a very strong transport business which is just our embedded processor.So I hope that's helpful. It's not anything that's terribly different from the prior generations. It's just that Marvell today has of very strong offering in this area and therefore, we think we can capture a lot more share than we had in 4G. We got you Ross. Yes. So I would say point one is it is broader and broader means obviously a number of customers, some of which are either flat or they slightly down or they just not sort of mean their forecast and then we did also call out that one of - one large customer. It was, quite pronounced in terms of the change in the demand signals and the outlook that we saw heading into this call, we had today.So it's not, - we're not signaling it's just one customer, we're saying there's broader weakness certainly from our lens. But clearly, our results and our guidance are driven mostly by the large customer just given their contribution to our overall revenue."

            "content": "Thanks Matt, and good afternoon everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 20120. Revenue in the second quarter was $657 million versus our guidance over $650 million at midpoint. Networking represented 50% of our revenue in the second quarter, with storage contributing 42%. Other product revenue was $52 million and accounted for 8% of the total company revenue. After strong second quarter we expect other products revenue to decline sequentially in the third quarter.GAAP gross margin was 53.4%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $450 million or 63.3% of revenue reflecting the change in mix within the quarter. GAAP operating expenses were $397 million, $22 million above the middle point of our guidance driven by acquisition and the divestiture related expenses. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $280 million below the guidance range you provided in May.As Matt discussed earlier, we were very successful in achieving our planned expense reductions two quarters ahead of schedule. Non-GAAP operating profit was $136 million or 21% of revenue. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.09. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share were $0.16 slightly above the middle point of guidance driven by higher revenue and lower expenses.Now turning to our balance sheet. In the second quarter we returned $56 million to shareholders through $60 million in share repurchases and $40 million in dividends. We exited the quarter with $573 million in cash and cash equivalent and a long term debt of $1.7 billion. We have paused share repurchases and debt reduction while we worked hard with closing the acquisitions of Aquantia, Avera as well as the sale of our Wi-Fi business to NXP. And we currently anticipate all of these transactions to be completed within our previously communicated timeframe.Given the ongoing uncertainty in end markets, we actively reduced the channel inventory in the second quarter and are planning on doing the same again in the third quarter with an aim of reducing channel DOI [ph] two weeks below our target level.Let me now move on to our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Please note that this guidance does not include any contributions from the pending acquisitions so far Aquantia and Avera as well as to the divestiture of Wi-Fi business. Similar to last quarter's outlook we expect our revenue in the kind of period to remain impacted by the U.S. Government's export restriction on Huawei.Specifically, we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $660 million plus or minus 3%. We anticipate our GAAP gross margin will be approximately between 53.5% and 54.5%. Our non-GAAP gross margin will be between 63% and 64%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $385 million plus or minus $5 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $280 million plus or minus $2.5 million which at the middle point will be similar to the prior quarter.We continue to maintain tight control for discretionary expenses given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment. We expect interest expense to be $20 million. As a result we anticipate GAAP loss per diluted share in the range of $0.09 to $0.05 and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of $0.15 to $0.19.Operator, we are now ready for Q&A. Karl, I'll answer the near-term question, Matt can add about the future of 5G. So, we just started post production shipment. So you shouldn't expect, it's a very - it's small revenue in Q3. Certainly, we expect that Q4, you will see the sequential ramp from the 5G product line. In the longer term, Matt, you can probably can give more longer term. We talk about the $600 million few years the opportunity. Of course, it would take time from the initial ramp to get to that $600 million annual run rate. So that's - hopefully that gives you some color about the near-term and the longer-term view. Hi, this is Jean. So the new product launch we are very excited about, is the gross margin, it's actually very similar. Our team has done tremendous work to really try to design to optimize the design, the performance to make sure we continue to drive to get to the value for IP for our design for our expertise. So I would say in general you should expect us to have very similar gross margin in our SSD and HDD market. Thanks Gary for the question. So as you probably have seen from a Aquantia's 10-Q filing, they are key customers of Aquantia's, they have been reducing inventory. So that's why it has a significant impact of Aquantia's revenue. Frankly, we think it's a great operational discipline to really balance the inventory and the supply-demand to make sure you are really being on the inventory at the customers.So that has always being Marvell's practice, we typically really don't have inventory at the customers unless they need it. So that process is ongoing. I would say, Aquantia team continue to win designs and also they have been ramping up new designs with key networking customers.So, we actually, really are quite comfortable. Once this inventory adjustment period ends and going into next fiscal year, which is our fiscal '21, they should be able to ramp back to the $100 million per year run rate we articulated during the deal announcement. So we feel pretty good about that. And our team, they are doing the integration planning and everything we have seen is quite consistent with what our deal assumption has been. So we'll give you more update when we get closer to the deal closure. Oh, yes. So it's about our other revenue category, so let me start by saying, right. This product category include our printer business and some of the other consumer-related business. Those business actually have a very long tail, it would last for multiple years. But it could be very lumpy because sometimes the customer wants to have a last time buy.So that's what happened in Q2, you actually sell that product line increase in revenue, that's because of a last time buy. In general, the way you should think about it or model it is, in the longer term, you should see the high single-digit year-over-year decline lasted for many years going forward. So that's how you should think about modeling this business going forward. Hey, Ross. Yes. So I appreciate your question. So the way to think about our storage business, you're right, we have been under shipping the market and our storage business, when you look at it overall, I appreciate the question about the 14-terabyte versus 16-terabyte and our position going forward on 16-terabyte and above certainly is much stronger. But overall, when you look at the dynamics of our storage businesses actually we continue to see just a stabilization, not like a significant pick up. So we are looking at it quarter-by-quarter like Matt said earlier.And overall, the way to look at it is actually the data center and the enterprise, which include both HDD and SSD solutions, you should see that revenue continue to go up in the second half and also going into next year. But as far as the dynamics for 16-terabyte, 14-terabyte, actually right now at this point, it's - the revenue is relatively lower percentage. So it's actually not impacting the overall revenue dynamics. So, John, just as Matt mentioned earlier right is do the first two exposure for us, this is a channel business and the China channel business. So it's a very small percentage of our revenue. And also as Matt mentioned earlier, we have been really prudent to manage channel inventory and it took down channel inventory significantly really two things through with this kind of and the market behavior. So I think it's a small exposure for us, but it is an interesting phenomenon. Hi, Ross thanks for the question. I think if you take a level higher to think about how we think about our business model, it continue to be the same driving principle is we really want to maximize returns for stakeholders, which means to generate a strong free cash flow, strong earnings and strong operating profit.So when we think about our long-term target model which - was set up like almost like more than a year ago, what we said is, hey the topline revenue growth that will be in the range of 6% to 8%, gross margins, it's going to be around the 66% and the operating margin 35% as you mentioned.So right now, when we look at the progress that the company has made during the last year are more than a year. We have again tremendous - momentum, than the Analyst Day in 5G, in the infrastructure market. Matt talked about each of the opportunity and upside which was now the part of the original Analyst Day. And of course both Aquantia and Avera and the WiFi divestiture, were not part for the - our internal business model.So the way we are thinking about, we can give you some perspective, but we are not updating the model. The perspective is basically on the top line. If we can drive the opportunity where have design wins and everything else in a normalized macro environment, we should see our revenue growing - call with a high end - range of our model. On the gross margin side, I think the way - first I want to say is as a company we are laser focused on gross margin improvement and you have seen us. We have had a really strong track record to improve gross margin.Going forward, there are few takes and puts for this gross margin dynamics, I think certainty storage business is stabilizing the near line that data center will help us increase of the gross margin. And also secondly, on the networking side, our automotive business, our switch 5 refreshed portfolio, they are all going to help to contribute positively to the gross margin. On the 5G side it's going to be a significant revenue driver, but some of our 5G products actually right now currently have a lower than corporate average gross margins.So the way you should expect us to do is going forward, we're laser focused now on improve the yield, the test time, because it's in the early ramp. There is certainly a maturity of production and on the yield side and test time side, which will improve gross margin.So, we continue to think, while we balance everything our gross margin should it be still very high may be in the 63% to 65% range, But overall the way to think about it is because our top line revenue growing is going to be much faster, the gross margin dollars are actually going to be much higher, which on the operating margin side that we definitely are very committed to the 35% operating margin.We do think structurally, if we can grow the revenue, our model will leverage quickly to deliver that kind of operating model. So hopefully that helps you to think through the longer term model."

Earnings Conference Call.  At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session and instructions will follow at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference Mr. Ashish Saran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.\nAshish Saran: Thank you and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Marvell first quarter fiscal year 2020 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell\u2019s President and CEO, and Jean Hu our CFO. I want to remind everyone that certain comments today may include forward-looking statements which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and which could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our website in the Investor Relations section. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt for his comments. Matt?\nMatt Murphy: Great! Thank you, Ashish, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Before we discuss our recent performance and outlook, I'm going to walk you through the three significant portfolio changes we've recently announced and put them into strategic context. As you may recall, when we began our transformation back in calendar 2016, we restructured Marvell pivoting to a new strategy with an intensified focus on storage and networking as our core markets. We put in place a number of key initiatives to organically improve margins and ignite top and bottom line growth. We delivered significant improvements from these initiatives in 2017 with substantial margin expansion and revenue growth.  In November of 2017 we announced our intent to leverage our strong balance and share price to fund the transformational acquisition of Cavium. We closed this highly complementary merger, midway through 2018, adding processing and security to our portfolio, along with additional scale and a more complete networking technology platform.  Since then we have successfully completed the integration of Cavium, raised our synergy targets over our initial estimates and driven multiple new high growth factors for the combined company, in 5G, automotive, ARM servers and AI. And as you are well aware, 5G is rapidly emerging as one of the most exciting growth catalysts for Marvell.  While we are on this journey, primarily focused on execution and integration, we continue to closely monitor our end markets and the broader semiconductor industry. We recognize that the market was softening late last year, and our view is that after many years of growth, our industry was bound for a contraction, particularly against an increasingly uncertain geopolitical backdrop. Nevertheless we determined that despite the challenging environment, we would sustain our R&D investments and continue to collaborate closely with customers in each of our growth market. And rather than just wait out the down period, we continue to assess the external market for inorganic opportunities and systematically manage our current portfolio to accelerate our pivot to infrastructure solutions. This culminated in the three transactions we recently announced, namely our planned acquisitions of Aquantia and Avera, as well as the divestiture of our Wi-Fi business. I'd like to comment on each specifically.  First Aquantia: This is a highly complementary acquisition, which upon closing will immediately add scale and breadth to our PHY business, while also exhilarating our reach into the fast growing Multi-Gig Enterprise and Automotive Ethernet areas. Avera has been very successful with copper PHYs at speeds of 1 gigabit and below, while Aquantia has been a leader in higher speed solutions of 2.5G/5G/10G. And as we look longer term with advanced driver assist and autonomous driving continuing to gain momentum, we expect that our processing security and AI capabilities will add on to our automotive networking platform, to establish Marvell as a leading supplier to the connected car of tomorrow.  Second, is our acquisition of Avera, originally part of IBM's Microelectronics business. This acquisition was motivated by the growing list of requests from our customers for new custom products including full ASIC. Avera with its proven track record in ASIC design was the ideal partner to complement our standard products and semi-custom capabilities. We have immediate opportunities in 5G, which we can now transition into design wins.  Marvell\u2019s broad technology platform will also enable the Avera team to help us become a leading edge ASIC provider to a wide range of networking and cloud customers.  Third, we are equally pleased about the plant sale of our Wi-Fi business to NXP. Marvell has a two decade history delivering innovative Wi-Fi and Bluetooth products and this business has been transformed over the past three years to focus on high performance solutions, including next generation Wi-Fi 6 products.  Recently we were approached by several companies interested in acquiring this business to help leverage their scale in the fast growing connected consumer and IoT markets. Unlike Marvell, these companies already possess both micro-controllers and a broad distribution channel critical for these markets, but were missing Wi-Fi capabilities.  As we evaluated these opportunities, it became clear to us that our high-performance connectivity assets would yield much greater economic value at a company with a strong Microcontroller franchise than they would as part of Marvell. This resulted in our agreement to sell this business to NXT, fundamentally the transaction value is significantly higher than what we could have extracted from this business over time on our own.  While these three announced transactions are significant independent events, they accelerate our strategic transformation into a leading supplier to the infrastructure market and they are a reflection of how we actively manage our overall portfolio and allocate capital to invest in the markets where we can generate the highest returns.  Let me just put this into perspective. Once we complete all three transactions, in the first year post close we will be replacing approximately $300 million in Wi-Fi revenue that we are selling for a 6x revenue multiple with greater than $400 million in combined Aquantia and Avera revenue we are purchasing for a 3x revenue multiple. This new revenue will be on a faster growth trajectory and will accelerate Marvell\u2019s ability to capitalize on two critical industry tech trends, 5G and Connected Cars and will also command the higher gross and operating margins over the long term.  Proceeds from the sale of the Wi-Fi business will pay for both Aquantia and Avera and will net us at least $500 million in cash to add to our balance sheet. I am also equally excited about the tremendous engineering talent and capabilities these two acquisitions will bring the Marvell. Hiring talented engineers in our industry is highly competitive, so being able to add an entire R&D teams with well-established track records of execution, enables us to capitalize our market opportunities much faster than building teams one hired at a time.  We recognize that these are bold moves, and I'm very pleased that we are able to negotiate and announce all three deals in such a short time frame. Over the next year we will be focused on integrating these new businesses and successfully transitioning our Wi-Fi business to NXP, while ramping our newest design wins in 5G, Data Center, Automotive and Enterprise application.  Now let's shift gears to discuss our recent performance. Revenue for the first quarter was $662 million, about the midpoint of our guidance range, as our storage revenue was higher than anticipated. Notwithstanding this result, we recognize that the recent increase in trade tensions including U.S. Government Export Restrictions to a Chinese OEM has further dampened demanded in an already challenging macroeconomic environment. These factors are reflected in our outlook for the second quarter.  Specifically with respect to the customer export restriction, our direction revenue exposure is approximately a mid-single digit percentage of our total revenue, primarily in our networking business, although there is an impact on storage revenue as well. The export restriction was implemented in the second week of our quarter, limiting revenue from that customer to shipments during that short window.  In addition, there are indirect impacts to our business which we cannot quantify, to the extent that some of our other customers products may incorporate Marvell's chips inside. It could also be impacted by the export restrictions. While these issues are obviously beyond our control, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Now, moving on to the performance of our two core businesses. In the first quarter our Networking Revenue was $341 million, down 12% sequentially. As you may recall, we had expected a double digit sequential decline reflecting seasonality, high inventory control at key customers and a cautious outlook from our Chinese customers.  Most product lines decline sequentially, which is not unusual for this time of the year. In addition we saw the start of an expected decline and demand from our base station customers, as they prepare to transition from 4G products to 5G later this year. During this transitional period they are also shipping free 5G base stations, but we do not see the full benefit from these shipments as OEMs are using FPGAs for processing in the interim.  Our 5G solutions, including our OCTEON Embedded Processor and Fusion baseband processors remain on track and we have now successfully taped out and sampled both of these products. Our lead customer is set to ramp production on schedule in the fourth fiscal quarter of this year.  As I mentioned in our last earnings call, we secured a second Tier 1 OEM design win for our Fusion baseband processor and I'm pleased to report that we are on schedule to sample the semi-custom product in early calendar 2020.  Now I\u2019d like to share some new developments for Marvell in the 5G market. As you may know, modern macro-based stations are comprised of two separate sections, the baseband unit and the radio head. Today our processors reside only in the baseband unit with embedded-OCTEON managing control and data-plane functions, while Fusion basebands encode and decode data signals.  However, as we have continued to closely partner with our customers, they have asked us to solve power and bandwidth challenges across the entire base station and not just in the traditional baseband unit. I am very pleased to announce that two of these opportunities have now translated into new designed wins.  The first is a Front haul Interface Solution that connects baseband units to remote radio heads and 5G deployments. The substantial increase in bandwidth and 5G is driving the need for efficient protocol translations for transport of radio data over Front haul lengths. We expect this custom shift to ramp production in the second half of calendar 2021.  Second and even more exciting, we now have our first design win for our processor in the 5G remote radiohead itself. In 5G there is an increase in the use of massive MIMO to enable higher capacity and throughput. The complex beamforming needed in these deployments is generating new demand for our optimized low power processing capabilities, enabling us to capture entirely new content within the radiohead.  To meet the fast deployment time line for 5G, customers will go to production with our existing Fusion processor by the end of this fiscal year. On top of this, customers have also engaged with us to architect custom purpose built solutions for massive MIMO processing. This trend greatly expands Marvell\u2019s addressable market.  Both of these strategic design wins reflect Marvell\u2019s expanding beach heads in areas that are currently dominated by FPGAs. Driven by the increase in processing requirements in 5G, including in the radiohead, are expertise and power efficiency in processing is opening new, significant opportunities.  Together we estimate these wins could add on average approximately $500 of new Marvell content per base station, assuming a conservative 20% of tax rate for massive MIMO and 5G. Industry analyst forecasts are actually predicting higher tax rates within the time frame we expect to start shipping our solutions.  These are just two examples from our expanding pipeline. While we have been organically increasing our R&D headcount including the recent opening of our Raleigh design center, the addition of Avera\u2019s talented team and extensive custom design expertise will further accelerate our ability to capitalize on these growing opportunities.  Moving now to our second quarter outlook for networking in fiscal 2020. After taking into account the export restriction, we expect revenue to be down slightly on a sequential basis. Without the export restriction, we would expect networking revenue to be up sequentially.  Turning your storage business; storage revenue for the first quarter came in above our expectations at $279 million declining 12% sequentially. This expected sequential decline was due to a combination of seasonality and excess inventory in the supply chains of our storage controller customers.  Within the quarter fiber channel revenue was weaker than expected, but the shortfall was more than offset by higher than expected revenue from storage controllers. Our fiber channel business was impacted by a very soft server market in the first quarter, the server units declining by about 18% sequentially, much worse than typical mid-single digit seasonal declines.  It appeared that the weakness in compute demand extends beyond just the cloud and is now showing up in the enterprise as well. And our storage controller business, while we benefitted from better than expected revenue, we do not think that this was indicative of any real resurgence in demand from the end market. We believe that the upside was primarily driven by a customer building buffers to manage a factory transition. We have taken the dynamic into account in our revenue projections for next quarter.  So for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect that the demand for Marvell Storage Controllers will remain soft, reflecting continued weak macro-economic conditions. After incorporating the impact of the export restrictions and accounting for the customer factory transition I just discussed, we expect an approximate mid-single digit sequential decline in our storage, second quarter revenue.  Looking at the first two quarters of fiscal 2020 collectively and after adjusting for the export restriction, stored revenue was tracking close to what we would expect given the current market conditions. We continue to believe that we will be under shipping the end market for our storage controllers, through a significant part of this fiscal year. That said our customers continue to signal a strong demand environment in the second half of the year. In the meantime we remain focused on efficiently managing our storage business and continuing to pivot this business towards the enterprise and datacenter market.  In closing, despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, we are executing to our strategy and taking bold steps to accelerate our transformation. With the production ramp of our first 5G products on track for later this year and expanding pipeline of design wins, we are well positioned to realize our vision of becoming a leading supplier of Infrastructure Semiconductor Solutions.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more details on our recent results and our outlook.\nJean Hu: Thanks Matt and a good afternoon everyone. I'll start with a reveal of our financial results for the first quarter and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2020.  Revenue in the first quarter was $662 million versus our guidance of $650 million at midpoint. Networking represented 52% of our revenue in the first quarter, with storage contributing 42%. Other product accounted for 6% of revenue.  GAAP gross margin was 54.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 64.1%. GAAP operating expenses were $383 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $295 million at the low end of the guidance range you provided in March. We continue to tightly manage OpEx in a difficult environment. I am also very pleased to report that we successfully integrated Marvell and the Cavium ERP systems early in the first quarter. With ERP integration complete, we expect to achieve our OpEx synergy goal from the Cavium acquisition in upcoming second fiscal quarter, six months ahead of our plan. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.07. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.16 at the top end of our guidance range.  Now turning to our balance sheet. In the first quarter we paid down $50 million of our long-term debt and returned $89 million to shareholders to $50 million in share repurchases and $39 million in dividends. We exited the quarter with $572 million in cash and cash equivalent and the long term debt of $1.7 billion.  As Matt mentioned, through the two acquisitions and the one divestiture, we have actively managed our portfolio to maximize the shareholder returns. We currently plan to use the expected cash proceeds of $1.76 billion from the sale of our Wi-Fi business to pay for both Aquantia and Avera acquisitions. The resulting excess cash is expected to be at least $500 million.  In addition, we expect our business will continue to generate a strong free cash flow. As a result, we\u2019ll have significant financial flexibility to pay down debt over the next year, to achieve our target gross debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x and also returned a large amount of cash to shareholders through share buyback, while maintaining our current dividend level. As a reminder, we currently have approximately $900 million in outstanding share repurchase authority.  Let me now move on to our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. This guidance takes into account our estimated revenue impact from U.S. Governments current, as for the restriction to Wi-Fi customers.  We expect our revenue to be $650 million, plus or minus 3%. Our expected GAAP gross margin will be approximately between 53% and 54% and non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 63% to 64%. This projection for gross margin reflects a weaker product mix, due to impact of export retraction, relatively lower storage revenue and a seasonally strong consumer based product ramp. We do expect our non-GAAP gross margin to return to about 64% in the following quarter.  We project our GAAP operating expenses to be between $370 million and $380 million, and the non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $285 million to $290 million. We expect net interest expense to be $19 million and the non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 4.5%. We anticipate GAAP loss per diluted share in the range of $0.09 to $0.05 and a non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.13 to $0.17. Operator, please open the lines for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is now open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the Wi-Fi transaction, very impressive.  Matt does that exact require China approval, and as part of that would be very helpful if you could help us quantify that revenue and gross margin and OpEx impact from a fiscal \u201820 or \u201821 perspective, so we can focus on your base business. \nMatt Murphy: Sure, yeah hi Vivek. So on the first question, the transaction on Wi-Fi does require China approval and then Jean, do you want to comment on the second part? \nJean Hu : Yeah, so on the revenue side for fiscal \u201819 this businesses revenue is approximately $300 million. For fiscal \u201820 it's about the same level. The gross margin is around 50%. I think the operating expense, the operating margin within Marvell is much lower than our corporate average. So it\u2019s around the 15% to 20% of operating margin. So that's the way how you can think about this business. \nVivek Arya: Got it, and then from a bigger picture perspective, you know at your Analyst Day you had outlined very strong operating model of high single digit kind of sales growth and over 65% gross margin and you know high operating margins. Given all the transactions you have announced Matt, is that still the operating model or should we think about something else at this stage. \nMatt Murphy: No, I think you should think about that as the operating model. You know there's a number of moving pieces, but part of the comprehension of doing all there of these was that we would maintain the operating model that we have committed to and certainly Jean mentioned having Wi-Fi coming out and these two others coming in, plus you know what we're planning on doing with it, we're going to stick to the same operating model. \nVivek Arya: Okay, thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is now open. \nAmbrish Srivastava : Hi, thank you very much. I apologize for the background noise. Just a question on \u2013 Jean, this is for you so that we are all on the same page. Would you rather than we take out the mid-single digits Huawei exposure from our model and if the answer to that is yes, how should we think about modulating OpEx, and I guess gross margin is going to be lowered by 100, 150 bips based on the mix, the Cavium mix to Huawei and then I had a quick follow-up.\nJean Hu: Yeah, that\u2019s a good question. So on the Huawei side you know its mid-single digit impact. So in Q2 we have assumed no Huawei shipment for the remaining of the quarter and going forward. So from that perspective, Huawei revenue is complete out after the balance development.  And when you think about it from the operating expense perspective right, at first we have to invest in our portfolio and the opportunity to address across all different product lines, different regions. Huawei is only one like mid-single digit revenue customers. So we don't think this Huawei ban will impact our investment level, and of course we are very mindful, we are managing discretionary expense to make sure, you know we are disciplined to manage OpEx. So that\u2019s the way how we are thinking about. We are going to manage it through this Huawei issue and make sure we drive the long term revenue growth and the margin expansion. \nAmbrish Srivastava : Okay, and for my follow-up real quick Matt, I just wanted to make sure I understood this. On the storage side has the outlook changed versus what you are thinking in Q1, or \u2013 sorry, when you talked to us last time or is it about the same in terms of as you had said that time that you were shipping below end demand as well. Has anything changed or it\u2019s kind of in line with what you are expecting? \nMatt Murphy: Yeah Ambrish, it\u2019s very much in line you know from where we were a quarter ago. Obviously we had some out performance in Q1 that was relative to this factory transition I mentioned, so no update other than if you think about kind of Q1 plus Q2, it\u2019s in line with what we were discussing the last time we talked and we do believe we're still going to continue to under ship demand in Q2 as well. \nJean Hu: Yeah on the gross margin side, maybe I would add to the question you asked on the gross margin side. If you look at our Q2 growth margin there are a few headwinds that impact gross margin. The Huawei ban certainly has some impact, but also we do have a seasonal strong consumer related product brand, which actually has bigger impact. So when you look at going back to Q3, that season impact is going to come down from a mix perspective.  So we do expect our gross margin to back above 64%. And as Matt mentioned earlier, we are not changing our long term target model. We continue to believe we will be able to drive our gross margin to go up going forward. \nAmbrish Srivastava : Thanks for circling back on that Jean, I appreciate it. Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes in Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Harlem, please check your mute button. \nHarlan Sur : Sorry, can you hear me now? \nMatt Murphy: Yeah, go ahead Harlan. \nHarlan Sur : Okay, thank you. Assuming that the Huawei ban continues for the remainder of the calendar year, off of the Q2 guide I would assume that the team would see sort of normal seasonal growth in Q3 and then if you do start shipping 5G to your lead customer and some continued inventory improvements on the storage side, you should probably see some sequential growth in Q4 as well. Is that kind of the right way to think about the overall trajectory of the business for the remainder of the year. \nJean Hu: Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. I think of the simple way to look at it is Huawei is about mid-single digit of our revenue, so when you look at your model, the seasonality for Q3, Q4 the simple way to do it, just take out mid-single digit revenue out from the ramp, the typical seasonal ramp from the rest of the quarter will be fine.\nHarlan Sur : Okay, great. And then on the two new 5G opportunities, one is front hall. I assume that it\u2019s the high high-speed security connection. You said calendar year second half \u201921 ramp; on the second design win with your processes solution, I'm assuming that this is doing more of the digital front end functionality. When does this design win start to ramp, and are both of these wins with your two existing 5G customers or are they with different 5G customers. Thank you. \nMatt Murphy: Sure, okay. So yes, so you're in the ballpark on the front haul, you know that\u2019s the type of socket we\u2019re talking about. On the second one, it's not doing the digital front end, think of it as when you go to massive MIMOs, every radio is going to have some digital front end processing in it.  When you go to a massive MIMO, there is going to be additional processing that's required and so what we're seeing is one of our customers and we're not going to go into who and when as we talk about these different sockets from today, but think of it as that processing needs to get added to support massive MIMO, our products are actually well suited to do that and so those are being designed in and those are going to ramp in Q4 of this year. So that's one that's a pleasant surprise to us. \nHarlan Sur : Thanks Matt. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. \nRoss Seymore: Hi, thanks for letting me ask a couple of questions. Matt, first for you on the networking side of things; obviously people know you have taken the Huawei business out, and so that\u2019s in the networking site, but your guidance is for that to be relatively flat or just slightly down I think is what you said.  So can you talk a little bit about what's going on with the core business growing, what's driving that and then maybe in a bigger picture sense, what sort of reaction are your other customers having if the Huawei side of the equation can't ship? Are those leading those customers getting more eager to take share and attacked the Chinese market? Is that leading to some of the new design wins you have. Just wanted to see what the competitive reaction is in a broader sense. \nMatt Murphy: Okay, sure, let me take them one at a time. So on the first one, just to go back, you know networking we got it to decline in Q2. What we said was if you put in Huawei back in, so it was apples-to-apples and networking would be up sequentially, so that's a positive. So you should assume ex-Huawei networking is going to increase sequentially.  That\u2019s offset a little bit by the fact that some of our customers in 4G, there has been some slowdown there as pre-5G systems are shipping and then there's some anticipation of you know production 5G coming online in the second half. So there\u2019s a few moving pieces, but the net-net is that networking ex-Huawei is up.  On the second question, yes, so the design activity we\u2019ve seen on this, take it high level first, is very robust okay. It\u2019s across a number of different products and technologies that we sell across, a number of different customers.  None of these design wins are related to any issue with what's going on the Chinese customer that's going through the export restrictions, and whether or not you know the other competitors are going to take share, I think all those CEOs are getting those questions right now and it\u2019s a bunch of articles you can read from those guys about how they are viewing that situation.  But just to be clear, the opportunities we see are just a result of quite frankly you know deep engagements with the customers in the space, a very compelling platform of switches, processors, basebands, you know all the key pieces and now some high speed connectivity, all the key pieces that are required to enable 5G, so that\u2019s helpful. \nRoss Seymore: Yeah, it is. And for my follow-up question, switching gears over to the storage side, I know you just answered to a prior question that throughout the first half of the year it's really doing what you had expected. But you mentioned in your preamble that the enterprise side was starting to show signs of weakness and it wasn't just a cloud dynamic anymore. Could you give a little bit more color on that? Is that just within the fiber channel side; is that a broader dynamic and how is that the same as before if it sounds like that\u2019s a new development? \nMatt Murphy: Sure, so I'd say that while we give the commentary around fiber channel, you know the market numbers I gave you which is the 18%, that's a market number, that\u2019s a server decline and you know it's not all cloud. So commentary was really we're seeing some of this in fiber channel, but I think it\u2019s related to a bigger picture and when we up-pack sort of where the market is going, the declines are not all clouded.  It\u2019s actually happening in the enterprise space as well, so we thought it would be appropriate to comment on that given that we've got you know reasonable exposure there, and you know you could sort of speculate on why, but I think the bottom line is we see that trend as being, you know not a strong one at this point. \nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Your line is now open. \nBlayne Curtis: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I have a few \u2013 I just wanted to follow-up on Ross\u2019s question, because maybe I missed what you said and I\u2019m just kind of curious what is growing? You said ex-Huawei would be growing in the back half of enterprise being softer. Have you seen any of that softness still into you know your [inaudible] switching? \nJean Hu: Hey Ross, this is Jean. So I\u2019ll add some color, right. So when you look at this sequentially, we do see we have a diversified product lines and networking from security, switch, PHY. All those things are actually growing sequentially, which offset the Huawei impact and we're actually very pleased actually with all the networking product to the classical mobile side. The design wins continue to ramp up with different other customers across you know both major OEMs and broad customers outside of China. So that's really what's happening sequentially.\nBlayne Curtis: Got you. Thanks Jean, and I do look like Ross, but it's Blayne. The \u2013 just maybe follow up on the new design win Matt. I mean obviously the Avera deal gets you access to a lot of these ASIC\u2019s designs, many of them are in the radio and you are talking about Fusion in there. Kind of is that temporarily or is that doing some additional functionality and maybe there is more of a content during the radio head. Just kind of curious to see your perspective?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, just to be super clear, the new opportunity we're speaking about is additional content, okay. So it's independent of the solutions that you mentioned.  Now, what I would say is if you think about the long-term where if we can have a strong presence in the digital front-end, and we can have the processing capability for massive MIMO, and then you can think about having all sorts of options to really leverage the technology platform in the company to optimize these designs over time, and I think from a supplier point of view, we are going to be viewed as extremely compelling and having all these pieces. But yes, we're excited to actually be able to \u2013 with Avera coming online to be able to participate in that part of the market as well, which we had not previously at Marvell.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks. \nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Stifel. Your line is now open.\nKevin Cassidy: Yeah thanks. I\u2019ll switch topics a little bit by asking about your Ethernet business. Can you give us an update of what\u2019s happened with the NIC card business and also your new Ethernet Switch that was introduced to some type of design win traction you might have there? \nMatt Murphy: Sure, yeah hi Kevin. So I\u2019ll make a couple of comments. So I think on the Ethernet NIC side, it\u2019s a pretty small business for us. You know you may be familiar with it, it primarily sells under the enterprise. Our cloud position there is small. So think of that as being a smaller business tied to the enterprise cycle.  For our new product which is our 12.8 terabit switch, that\u2019s doing really well. You know we introduced it about a quarter ago. Design pipeline looks good. A lot of interest from a number of customers. I\u2019m not really ready to give a detailed update, but I\u2019d say that the traction is very strong for that product and we\u2019ve been very pleased by the reception.  So I think you know as time goes on we\u2019ll be happy to update the Investment community about how our Ethernet story plays as we\u2019ve now really entered a brand new segment that we weren\u2019t in before, addressing the higher end you know from 3.2 all the way to 12.8. \nKevin Cassidy: Right, and that\u2019s right, I was wondering if you even could give us an estimate of when you\u2019d expect to start to see revenue for that Ethernet switch. \nMatt Murphy: I think it\u2019s still early days Kevin. You know the design cycles depending on the customer tend to be a little bit longer here, so I don\u2019t think I\u2019m quite ready to commit to that. It\u2019s a bit early, but we\u2019ll certainly be happy to do that as we get a little bit closer or make some more progress.\nKevin Cassidy: Okay, great, thank you. \nA - Matt Murphy: You\u2019re welcome. \nOperator: Thank you. And your next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open. John, please check your mute button. \nAshish Saran : Let\u2019s just move on to the next question please. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. \nMark Delaney: Yes, good afternoon, thanks very much for taking the question. The first question is, I want to better understand how the company was kind of incorporate some of the broader implications from Huawei and Matt I know you said that you kind of incorporate the mid-single digit. Direct exposures are difficult to gauge and that\u2019s some of the potential knock-on effects to other customer, for example in storage and some of your drive customers have some exposure. Did you factor in any additional conservatism into your guidance and storage and network and you try and think about some of those potential factors. Is there any other color you can give us on how Marvell is thinking about that would be helpful. \nJean Hu: Yes, our current assumption is really just to take out this one particular Chinese customer's revenue going forward. Matt mentioned it during his prepared remarks about the potential impact from our other customers. They get impacted which will come to impact us. We are not going to be able to estimate at this point what it means. It's just something we're mindful, but it's not in our current assumption and forecast.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. I think it's absolutely right. I think the assumption we're making is that our customers that we are talking to have comprehended this and their demand signals are sending us, and I think we're mindful of that and certainly hoping that they are doing that. But I think it's \u2013 as Jean pointed out, it's really difficult for us to add a judgment on top of somebody else's judgment, and so we're \u2013 I think the cleanest way was just to take Huawei out, outside of the numbers, and let's hope that the whole industry has kind of got the same methodology for accounting for this.\nMark Delaney: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And my follow-up is just on the strategic roadmap that the company has been underway with in doing the ample of acquisitions and appreciating all the commentary you provided along that front. Assuming all three deals close, you mentioned your cash balance would go up. Should we think about appetite for Marvell to do any additional M&A given the strong balance sheet that would result or would you want to fully integrate Avera, what the people are thinking about any future M&A? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy:\n\u2019:\n\u2019: But Jean, maybe you want to comment on, you know the, I guess you\u2019re already commented on.\n\u2019: But Jean, maybe you want to comment on, you know the, I guess you\u2019re already commented on.\n\u2019: But Jean, maybe you want to comment on, you know the, I guess you\u2019re already commented on.\nJean Hu: Yes.\nMatt Murphy:\n\u2019:\nJean Hu:\n\u2019: I think, if you think about it, our first priorities that we think we have a tremendous financial flexibility to both buyback some shares and also pay down the debt. So, that will be our focus of cost in the longer term. You know our capital allocation policy has not changed.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley FBR. Your line is now open.\nCraig Ellis:\n\u2019:\n\u2019:\nMatt Murphy:\n\u2019: I would actually back up the clock a little bit, even go to pre-Cavium, you know when the team arrived here about three years ago, by the way. We \u2013 and you are were early on in the story, Craig - we did a lot, okay.  We obviously, we pivoted the company around a new strategy. We divested, you know a number of businesses, simultaneously in parallel, by the way, sold building, consolidated design centers, you know tremendous amount of activity and what we learned through that process and what we developed was a very strong culture of execution and doing things on schedule are better and doing them on budget or better. That bode well for when we did Cavium, and that integration as Jean pointed out, very happy with our team.  The fact that we were able to do the entire ERP integration in about nine months, ahead of schedule, I mean you can hear horror stories of ERPs gone wrong.

Your line is now open.\nRick Schafer:\n\u2019:\n\u2019:\n\u2019:\n\u2019:\nMatt Murphy:\n\u2019: But I don\u2019t have all the exact TAM numbers yet. And I think as we - the way I\u2019d say it is, we need to \u2013 I want to see how the, this year is playing out in terms of all the things that we\u2019re working on, and then come back to you guys with a more comprehensive view, because it seems like every quarter we\u2019re finding new things, and then it\u2019s you know, I\u2019d rather give a comprehensive update at a later date, [inaudible].\n\u2019: But I don\u2019t have all the exact TAM numbers yet.

And then Jean, I know you got a lot on your plate, but just on the Avera, I know you talked about it being a 50% or so gross margin businesses, historically and you\u2019ve talked about improving on that. You know sort of how close do you think the corporate average Avera can eventually get? And sort of how do you get there? What are some of the bigger moving parts? I mean could this be a 60% or better gross margin revenue stream over \u2013 I don\u2019t know, over a certain timeline, maybe identify what that timeline might be?\nJean Hu: Yes. It will take some time right and the way to think about it is for any new design wins that we are going to get, the gross margin is going to be very similar to Marvell\u2019s corporate average. So when you start to mix the platforms over time, it\u2019s going to migrated to our current gross margin, but it will take time. Remember, all those things have very long cycle, typically the last five years or beyond sometimes, but we are very confident over time it\u2019s going to get there. Secondly right, it\u2019s operationally \u2013 we have a really strong operational team. We do think once we integrate Avera into Marvell, we\u2019re going to have the opportunity to improve cost over sales, and that you also help the margin improvement going forward. So we\u2019ll provide you all detailed update when we close the transaction. But we do think we\u2019ll have the opportunity to migrate their gross margin to close to ours over time.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. And what I\u2019d say Rick too, I think one of the variables that I would add on top of what Jean said is that, we have to first get this closed and get the team in, and then really assess the opportunity pipeline because in this business, like actually our, even our standard product business, I mean the ability to command premium margins really comes with the value and the differentiation that you add.  And so when we look at our pipeline, we also want to \u2013 we\u2019re going to have some flexibility, right, because we\u2019re going to look at okay, how much \u2013 you know how many opportunities we have that are just pure, pure ASIC? How many are where we can add Marvell IP to help the customer differentiate, and so that\u2019s going to have a different margin structure, and so you know obviously we\u2019re a company that believes that gross margin equals innovation and that\u2019s what we\u2019re driving in the company.  But that being said, we also have to assess the SAM and that\u2019s going to be a part of how that journey goes, as what opportunities we decide to take or not, and what\u2019s the returns on those and the volume. But in any case the journey in that business will be up into the right, both from an operational improvement point of view, as well as on the new designs.\nRick Schafer: Got it, thanks. That\u2019s great color.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Arcuri with UBS. Your line is now open.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Hey, this is John on calling in for Tim. Hey, adding my congratulations on the connectivity divestiture, and I mean obviously you know our opinion already over the past year on what you guys should do with that business. But just kind of curious about your perspective, how long were you guys looking at this move?\nMatt Murphy: Which move?\nJean Hu: The Wi-Fi.\nMatt Murphy: Well, let\u2019s be clear, you know we were approached on this business, right. We didn\u2019t put it up for sale. We were approached on this business and we were approached by a number of parties and we elected to have those discussions and then it turned out to be a great outcome, but that was really the catalyst. It was just a number of in-bounds that looked compelling and we felt it was our obligations to take those seriously. On our own we were driving that business, right. I mean if you know, I mean we were \u2013 that business three years ago was low to mid 30% gross margins that has been declining in revenue. It had you know all kinds of issues and I think credit to the team here really improved that business structurally, re-pivoted it, got their mojo back, and the business has really got into a very good place, and that\u2019s why you can look at the valuation we got for it, because there\u2019s a lot of value that\u2019s been created and I think by the way I think NXP will do a fabulous job with the asset.  But yeah, you can see from what was paid for, it\u2019s a good business and we were fully prepared to drive it on our own as well.\nJohn Pitzer: Okay, alright. Fair enough. I appreciate the color. As my follow-up, in terms of your storage business, I mean can you give a little bit more color in terms of SSD versus HDD dynamics and what you see for the coming quarter as well?\nJean Hu: No, we don\u2019t provide that kind of details, right, because we also have a fiber channel in that business and some of the other product lines. So the way we look at it is actually from \u2013 and the market perspective, we look at the client, we look at the enterprise data center, and periodically we\u2019ll provide you with the details of how we are migrating to increasingly address the enterprise and the data center market. That\u2019s how we look at it going forward.\nJohn Pitzer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.\nGary Mobley : Hey, everyone. In the interest of time I\u2019ll post both my questions at the same time. In the just concluded April quarter, how much buy ahead was there from Huawei anticipation of the shipment ban? And Jean, you had mentioned in the past that you can bring these non-GAAP OpEx down to perhaps $280 million. And I think you laid out a timeframe of maybe the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, and you keep under-promising and over-delivering on that front. So I\u2019m curious in light of the revenue headwinds from Huawei and other factors as well, should we be thinking about maybe something better than $280 million by the end of this fiscal year?\nJean Hu: Yeah, so first on the Huawei question, right, the ban happened two weeks into our quarter, so we did not ship too much to then during the first two weeks of the quarter. And if you look back into the last few quarters, it\u2019s very difficult for us to tell how much inventory they are building, but our assessment is we believe the run rate business of Huawei is around the mid-single digit numbers of our revenue, so that\u2019s how we think about it. Secondly, on the operating expense question, I think we continue to target asset in Q4 fiscal \u201820. We\u2019ll get to close to $280 million operating expense, that\u2019s how we are targeting and I think our team has done a great job to manage OpEx each quarter. We\u2019ll continue to be disciplined in managing the OpEx to get to our target level.\nGary Mobley : Alright, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. And our final question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International Group. Your line is now open.\nChristopher Rolland: Hey guys, two quick ones from me. I guess first of all given the Huawei ban, do you think this is going to help other OEMs guys that you are more exposed to and hence help you guys?\nMatt Murphy: Sure, yeah hi Chris. So on that one again, I think there is quite a bit of commentary on this that\u2019s out there now. I think Ericsson\u2019s been asked, you know Nokia\u2019s been asked, Samsung\u2019s been asked, you know if you go through the list and so you can sort of listen to their view. I mean I think what they\u2019ll tell you there is short-term positive, there is also potentially long-term negative side.  It\u2019s hard to call and it\u2019s also hard to call when the situation resolves itself. So we don\u2019t have a particular point of view, other than the customers that we are engaged with are doing well in the market, certainly on their tenders and their bids and their positioning for the deployments coming up, and the design activity with those customers is very, very high. So that\u2019s the commentary I would give you. It\u2019s hard for me to handicap the global base station market puts and takes right now.\nChristopher Rolland: Great. And then lastly, have you guys in the industry heard anything about China withholding kind of rare earth materials, and if that would have any effect on the hard disk drive market or do you think that is a kind of low risk, low probability situation?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, don\u2019t know, not the expert on that, although I read in the newspaper over the weekend, kind of thing. So I don\u2019t have a particular view on rentals and then how it\u2019s going to trickle into the supply chain at this juncture.\nChristopher Rolland: Perfect! Thanks guys.\nMatt Murphy: Thanks Christopher.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session for today\u2019s call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Ashish Saran for any further remarks.\nAshish Saran: Thank you everyone for joining us today and we look forward to seeing you at upcoming conferences. Thanks and goodbye.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This concludes today\u2019s program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day!",

            "content": "Great! Thank you, Ashish, and good afternoon to everyone on the call. Before we discuss our recent performance and outlook, I'm going to walk you through the three significant portfolio changes we've recently announced and put them into strategic context. As you may recall, when we began our transformation back in calendar 2016, we restructured Marvell pivoting to a new strategy with an intensified focus on storage and networking as our core markets. We put in place a number of key initiatives to organically improve margins and ignite top and bottom line growth. We delivered significant improvements from these initiatives in 2017 with substantial margin expansion and revenue growth.  In November of 2017 we announced our intent to leverage our strong balance and share price to fund the transformational acquisition of Cavium. We closed this highly complementary merger, midway through 2018, adding processing and security to our portfolio, along with additional scale and a more complete networking technology platform.  Since then we have successfully completed the integration of Cavium, raised our synergy targets over our initial estimates and driven multiple new high growth factors for the combined company, in 5G, automotive, ARM servers and AI. And as you are well aware, 5G is rapidly emerging as one of the most exciting growth catalysts for Marvell.  While we are on this journey, primarily focused on execution and integration, we continue to closely monitor our end markets and the broader semiconductor industry. We recognize that the market was softening late last year, and our view is that after many years of growth, our industry was bound for a contraction, particularly against an increasingly uncertain geopolitical backdrop. Nevertheless we determined that despite the challenging environment, we would sustain our R&D investments and continue to collaborate closely with customers in each of our growth market. And rather than just wait out the down period, we continue to assess the external market for inorganic opportunities and systematically manage our current portfolio to accelerate our pivot to infrastructure solutions. This culminated in the three transactions we recently announced, namely our planned acquisitions of Aquantia and Avera, as well as the divestiture of our Wi-Fi business. I'd like to comment on each specifically.  First Aquantia: This is a highly complementary acquisition, which upon closing will immediately add scale and breadth to our PHY business, while also exhilarating our reach into the fast growing Multi-Gig Enterprise and Automotive Ethernet areas. Avera has been very successful with copper PHYs at speeds of 1 gigabit and below, while Aquantia has been a leader in higher speed solutions of 2.5G/5G/10G. And as we look longer term with advanced driver assist and autonomous driving continuing to gain momentum, we expect that our processing security and AI capabilities will add on to our automotive networking platform, to establish Marvell as a leading supplier to the connected car of tomorrow.  Second, is our acquisition of Avera, originally part of IBM's Microelectronics business. This acquisition was motivated by the growing list of requests from our customers for new custom products including full ASIC. Avera with its proven track record in ASIC design was the ideal partner to complement our standard products and semi-custom capabilities. We have immediate opportunities in 5G, which we can now transition into design wins.  Marvell's broad technology platform will also enable the Avera team to help us become a leading edge ASIC provider to a wide range of networking and cloud customers.  Third, we are equally pleased about the plant sale of our Wi-Fi business to NXP. Marvell has a two decade history delivering innovative Wi-Fi and Bluetooth products and this business has been transformed over the past three years to focus on high performance solutions, including next generation Wi-Fi 6 products.  Recently we were approached by several companies interested in acquiring this business to help leverage their scale in the fast growing connected consumer and IoT markets. Unlike Marvell, these companies already possess both micro-controllers and a broad distribution channel critical for these markets, but were missing Wi-Fi capabilities.  As we evaluated these opportunities, it became clear to us that our high-performance connectivity assets would yield much greater economic value at a company with a strong Microcontroller franchise than they would as part of Marvell. This resulted in our agreement to sell this business to NXT, fundamentally the transaction value is significantly higher than what we could have extracted from this business over time on our own.  While these three announced transactions are significant independent events, they accelerate our strategic transformation into a leading supplier to the infrastructure market and they are a reflection of how we actively manage our overall portfolio and allocate capital to invest in the markets where we can generate the highest returns.  Let me just put this into perspective. Once we complete all three transactions, in the first year post close we will be replacing approximately $300 million in Wi-Fi revenue that we are selling for a 6x revenue multiple with greater than $400 million in combined Aquantia and Avera revenue we are purchasing for a 3x revenue multiple. This new revenue will be on a faster growth trajectory and will accelerate Marvell's ability to capitalize on two critical industry tech trends, 5G and Connected Cars and will also command the higher gross and operating margins over the long term.  Proceeds from the sale of the Wi-Fi business will pay for both Aquantia and Avera and will net us at least $500 million in cash to add to our balance sheet. I am also equally excited about the tremendous engineering talent and capabilities these two acquisitions will bring the Marvell. Hiring talented engineers in our industry is highly competitive, so being able to add an entire R&D teams with well-established track records of execution, enables us to capitalize our market opportunities much faster than building teams one hired at a time.  We recognize that these are bold moves, and I'm very pleased that we are able to negotiate and announce all three deals in such a short time frame. Over the next year we will be focused on integrating these new businesses and successfully transitioning our Wi-Fi business to NXP, while ramping our newest design wins in 5G, Data Center, Automotive and Enterprise application.  Now let's shift gears to discuss our recent performance. Revenue for the first quarter was $662 million, about the midpoint of our guidance range, as our storage revenue was higher than anticipated. Notwithstanding this result, we recognize that the recent increase in trade tensions including U.S. Government Export Restrictions to a Chinese OEM has further dampened demanded in an already challenging macroeconomic environment. These factors are reflected in our outlook for the second quarter.  Specifically with respect to the customer export restriction, our direction revenue exposure is approximately a mid-single digit percentage of our total revenue, primarily in our networking business, although there is an impact on storage revenue as well. The export restriction was implemented in the second week of our quarter, limiting revenue from that customer to shipments during that short window.  In addition, there are indirect impacts to our business which we cannot quantify, to the extent that some of our other customers products may incorporate Marvell's chips inside. It could also be impacted by the export restrictions. While these issues are obviously beyond our control, we will continue to monitor the situation closely.  Now, moving on to the performance of our two core businesses. In the first quarter our Networking Revenue was $341 million, down 12% sequentially. As you may recall, we had expected a double digit sequential decline reflecting seasonality, high inventory control at key customers and a cautious outlook from our Chinese customers.  Most product lines decline sequentially, which is not unusual for this time of the year. In addition we saw the start of an expected decline and demand from our base station customers, as they prepare to transition from 4G products to 5G later this year. During this transitional period they are also shipping free 5G base stations, but we do not see the full benefit from these shipments as OEMs are using FPGAs for processing in the interim.  Our 5G solutions, including our OCTEON Embedded Processor and Fusion baseband processors remain on track and we have now successfully taped out and sampled both of these products. Our lead customer is set to ramp production on schedule in the fourth fiscal quarter of this year.  As I mentioned in our last earnings call, we secured a second Tier 1 OEM design win for our Fusion baseband processor and I'm pleased to report that we are on schedule to sample the semi-custom product in early calendar 2020.  Now I'd like to share some new developments for Marvell in the 5G market. As you may know, modern macro-based stations are comprised of two separate sections, the baseband unit and the radio head. Today our processors reside only in the baseband unit with embedded-OCTEON managing control and data-plane functions, while Fusion basebands encode and decode data signals.  However, as we have continued to closely partner with our customers, they have asked us to solve power and bandwidth challenges across the entire base station and not just in the traditional baseband unit. I am very pleased to announce that two of these opportunities have now translated into new designed wins.  The first is a Front haul Interface Solution that connects baseband units to remote radio heads and 5G deployments. The substantial increase in bandwidth and 5G is driving the need for efficient protocol translations for transport of radio data over Front haul lengths. We expect this custom shift to ramp production in the second half of calendar 2021.  Second and even more exciting, we now have our first design win for our processor in the 5G remote radiohead itself. In 5G there is an increase in the use of massive MIMO to enable higher capacity and throughput. The complex beamforming needed in these deployments is generating new demand for our optimized low power processing capabilities, enabling us to capture entirely new content within the radiohead.  To meet the fast deployment time line for 5G, customers will go to production with our existing Fusion processor by the end of this fiscal year. On top of this, customers have also engaged with us to architect custom purpose built solutions for massive MIMO processing. This trend greatly expands Marvell's addressable market.  Both of these strategic design wins reflect Marvell's expanding beach heads in areas that are currently dominated by FPGAs. Driven by the increase in processing requirements in 5G, including in the radiohead, are expertise and power efficiency in processing is opening new, significant opportunities.  Together we estimate these wins could add on average approximately $500 of new Marvell content per base station, assuming a conservative 20% of tax rate for massive MIMO and 5G. Industry analyst forecasts are actually predicting higher tax rates within the time frame we expect to start shipping our solutions.  These are just two examples from our expanding pipeline. While we have been organically increasing our R&D headcount including the recent opening of our Raleigh design center, the addition of Avera's talented team and extensive custom design expertise will further accelerate our ability to capitalize on these growing opportunities.  Moving now to our second quarter outlook for networking in fiscal 2020. After taking into account the export restriction, we expect revenue to be down slightly on a sequential basis. Without the export restriction, we would expect networking revenue to be up sequentially.  Turning your storage business; storage revenue for the first quarter came in above our expectations at $279 million declining 12% sequentially. This expected sequential decline was due to a combination of seasonality and excess inventory in the supply chains of our storage controller customers.  Within the quarter fiber channel revenue was weaker than expected, but the shortfall was more than offset by higher than expected revenue from storage controllers. Our fiber channel business was impacted by a very soft server market in the first quarter, the server units declining by about 18% sequentially, much worse than typical mid-single digit seasonal declines.  It appeared that the weakness in compute demand extends beyond just the cloud and is now showing up in the enterprise as well. And our storage controller business, while we benefitted from better than expected revenue, we do not think that this was indicative of any real resurgence in demand from the end market. We believe that the upside was primarily driven by a customer building buffers to manage a factory transition. We have taken the dynamic into account in our revenue projections for next quarter.  So for the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we expect that the demand for Marvell Storage Controllers will remain soft, reflecting continued weak macro-economic conditions. After incorporating the impact of the export restrictions and accounting for the customer factory transition I just discussed, we expect an approximate mid-single digit sequential decline in our storage, second quarter revenue.  Looking at the first two quarters of fiscal 2020 collectively and after adjusting for the export restriction, stored revenue was tracking close to what we would expect given the current market conditions. We continue to believe that we will be under shipping the end market for our storage controllers, through a significant part of this fiscal year. That said our customers continue to signal a strong demand environment in the second half of the year. In the meantime we remain focused on efficiently managing our storage business and continuing to pivot this business towards the enterprise and datacenter market.  In closing, despite a challenging macroeconomic environment, we are executing to our strategy and taking bold steps to accelerate our transformation. With the production ramp of our first 5G products on track for later this year and expanding pipeline of design wins, we are well positioned to realize our vision of becoming a leading supplier of Infrastructure Semiconductor Solutions.  And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more details on our recent results and our outlook. Sure, yeah hi Vivek. So on the first question, the transaction on Wi-Fi does require China approval and then Jean, do you want to comment on the second part? No, I think you should think about that as the operating model. You know there's a number of moving pieces, but part of the comprehension of doing all there of these was that we would maintain the operating model that we have committed to and certainly Jean mentioned having Wi-Fi coming out and these two others coming in, plus you know what we're planning on doing with it, we're going to stick to the same operating model. Yeah Ambrish, it's very much in line you know from where we were a quarter ago. Obviously we had some out performance in Q1 that was relative to this factory transition I mentioned, so no update other than if you think about kind of Q1 plus Q2, it's in line with what we were discussing the last time we talked and we do believe we're still going to continue to under ship demand in Q2 as well. Yeah, go ahead Harlan. Sure, okay. So yes, so you're in the ballpark on the front haul, you know that's the type of socket we're talking about. On the second one, it's not doing the digital front end, think of it as when you go to massive MIMOs, every radio is going to have some digital front end processing in it.  When you go to a massive MIMO, there is going to be additional processing that's required and so what we're seeing is one of our customers and we're not going to go into who and when as we talk about these different sockets from today, but think of it as that processing needs to get added to support massive MIMO, our products are actually well suited to do that and so those are being designed in and those are going to ramp in Q4 of this year. So that's one that's a pleasant surprise to us. Okay, sure, let me take them one at a time. So on the first one, just to go back, you know networking we got it to decline in Q2. What we said was if you put in Huawei back in, so it was apples-to-apples and networking would be up sequentially, so that's a positive. So you should assume ex-Huawei networking is going to increase sequentially.  That's offset a little bit by the fact that some of our customers in 4G, there has been some slowdown there as pre-5G systems are shipping and then there's some anticipation of you know production 5G coming online in the second half. So there's a few moving pieces, but the net-net is that networking ex-Huawei is up.  On the second question, yes, so the design activity we've seen on this, take it high level first, is very robust okay. It's across a number of different products and technologies that we sell across, a number of different customers.  None of these design wins are related to any issue with what's going on the Chinese customer that's going through the export restrictions, and whether or not you know the other competitors are going to take share, I think all those CEOs are getting those questions right now and it's a bunch of articles you can read from those guys about how they are viewing that situation.  But just to be clear, the opportunities we see are just a result of quite frankly you know deep engagements with the customers in the space, a very compelling platform of switches, processors, basebands, you know all the key pieces and now some high speed connectivity, all the key pieces that are required to enable 5G, so that's helpful. Sure, so I'd say that while we give the commentary around fiber channel, you know the market numbers I gave you which is the 18%, that's a market number, that's a server decline and you know it's not all cloud. So commentary was really we're seeing some of this in fiber channel, but I think it's related to a bigger picture and when we up-pack sort of where the market is going, the declines are not all clouded.  It's actually happening in the enterprise space as well, so we thought it would be appropriate to comment on that given that we've got you know reasonable exposure there, and you know you could sort of speculate on why, but I think the bottom line is we see that trend as being, you know not a strong one at this point. Yes, just to be super clear, the new opportunity we're speaking about is additional content, okay. So it's independent of the solutions that you mentioned.  Now, what I would say is if you think about the long-term where if we can have a strong presence in the digital front-end, and we can have the processing capability for massive MIMO, and then you can think about having all sorts of options to really leverage the technology platform in the company to optimize these designs over time, and I think from a supplier point of view, we are going to be viewed as extremely compelling and having all these pieces. But yes, we're excited to actually be able to \u2013 with Avera coming online to be able to participate in that part of the market as well, which we had not previously at Marvell. Sure, yeah hi Kevin. So I'll make a couple of comments. So I think on the Ethernet NIC side, it's a pretty small business for us. You know you may be familiar with it, it primarily sells under the enterprise. Our cloud position there is small. So think of that as being a smaller business tied to the enterprise cycle.  For our new product which is our 12.8 terabit switch, that's doing really well. You know we introduced it about a quarter ago. Design pipeline looks good. A lot of interest from a number of customers. I'm not really ready to give a detailed update, but I'd say that the traction is very strong for that product and we've been very pleased by the reception.  So I think you know as time goes on we'll be happy to update the Investment community about how our Ethernet story plays as we've now really entered a brand new segment that we weren't in before, addressing the higher end you know from 3.2 all the way to 12.8. I think it's still early days Kevin. You know the design cycles depending on the customer tend to be a little bit longer here, so I don't think I'm quite ready to commit to that. It's a bit early, but we'll certainly be happy to do that as we get a little bit closer or make some more progress. Yes. I think it's absolutely right. I think the assumption we're making is that our customers that we are talking to have comprehended this and their demand signals are sending us, and I think we're mindful of that and certainly hoping that they are doing that. But I think it's \u2013 as Jean pointed out, it's really difficult for us to add a judgment on top of somebody else's judgment, and so we're \u2013 I think the cleanest way was just to take Huawei out, outside of the numbers, and let's hope that the whole industry has kind of got the same methodology for accounting for this. ': ': ': Yes. ': Yes. And what I'd say Rick too, I think one of the variables that I would add on top of what Jean said is that, we have to first get this closed and get the team in, and then really assess the opportunity pipeline because in this business, like actually our, even our standard product business, I mean the ability to command premium margins really comes with the value and the differentiation that you add.  And so when we look at our pipeline, we also want to \u2013 we're going to have some flexibility, right, because we're going to look at okay, how much \u2013 you know how many opportunities we have that are just pure, pure ASIC? How many are where we can add Marvell IP to help the customer differentiate, and so that's going to have a different margin structure, and so you know obviously we're a company that believes that gross margin equals innovation and that's what we're driving in the company.  But that being said, we also have to assess the SAM and that's going to be a part of how that journey goes, as what opportunities we decide to take or not, and what's the returns on those and the volume. But in any case the journey in that business will be up into the right, both from an operational improvement point of view, as well as on the new designs. Which move? Well, let's be clear, you know we were approached on this business, right. We didn't put it up for sale. We were approached on this business and we were approached by a number of parties and we elected to have those discussions and then it turned out to be a great outcome, but that was really the catalyst. It was just a number of in-bounds that looked compelling and we felt it was our obligations to take those seriously. On our own we were driving that business, right. I mean if you know, I mean we were \u2013 that business three years ago was low to mid 30% gross margins that has been declining in revenue. It had you know all kinds of issues and I think credit to the team here really improved that business structurally, re-pivoted it, got their mojo back, and the business has really got into a very good place, and that's why you can look at the valuation we got for it, because there's a lot of value that's been created and I think by the way I think NXP will do a fabulous job with the asset.  But yeah, you can see from what was paid for, it's a good business and we were fully prepared to drive it on our own as well. Sure, yeah hi Chris. So on that one again, I think there is quite a bit of commentary on this that's out there now. I think Ericsson's been asked, you know Nokia's been asked, Samsung's been asked, you know if you go through the list and so you can sort of listen to their view. I mean I think what they'll tell you there is short-term positive, there is also potentially long-term negative side.  It's hard to call and it's also hard to call when the situation resolves itself. So we don't have a particular point of view, other than the customers that we are engaged with are doing well in the market, certainly on their tenders and their bids and their positioning for the deployments coming up, and the design activity with those customers is very, very high. So that's the commentary I would give you. It's hard for me to handicap the global base station market puts and takes right now. Yes, don't know, not the expert on that, although I read in the newspaper over the weekend, kind of thing. So I don't have a particular view on rentals and then how it's going to trickle into the supply chain at this juncture. Thanks Christopher."

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thanks Matt and a good afternoon everyone. I'll start with a reveal of our financial results for the first quarter and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2020.  Revenue in the first quarter was $662 million versus our guidance of $650 million at midpoint. Networking represented 52% of our revenue in the first quarter, with storage contributing 42%. Other product accounted for 6% of revenue.  GAAP gross margin was 54.6% and non-GAAP gross margin was 64.1%. GAAP operating expenses were $383 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $295 million at the low end of the guidance range you provided in March. We continue to tightly manage OpEx in a difficult environment. I am also very pleased to report that we successfully integrated Marvell and the Cavium ERP systems early in the first quarter. With ERP integration complete, we expect to achieve our OpEx synergy goal from the Cavium acquisition in upcoming second fiscal quarter, six months ahead of our plan. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.07. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.16 at the top end of our guidance range.  Now turning to our balance sheet. In the first quarter we paid down $50 million of our long-term debt and returned $89 million to shareholders to $50 million in share repurchases and $39 million in dividends. We exited the quarter with $572 million in cash and cash equivalent and the long term debt of $1.7 billion.  As Matt mentioned, through the two acquisitions and the one divestiture, we have actively managed our portfolio to maximize the shareholder returns. We currently plan to use the expected cash proceeds of $1.76 billion from the sale of our Wi-Fi business to pay for both Aquantia and Avera acquisitions. The resulting excess cash is expected to be at least $500 million.  In addition, we expect our business will continue to generate a strong free cash flow. As a result, we'll have significant financial flexibility to pay down debt over the next year, to achieve our target gross debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5x and also returned a large amount of cash to shareholders through share buyback, while maintaining our current dividend level. As a reminder, we currently have approximately $900 million in outstanding share repurchase authority.  Let me now move on to our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2020. This guidance takes into account our estimated revenue impact from U.S. Governments current, as for the restriction to Wi-Fi customers.  We expect our revenue to be $650 million, plus or minus 3%. Our expected GAAP gross margin will be approximately between 53% and 54% and non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 63% to 64%. This projection for gross margin reflects a weaker product mix, due to impact of export retraction, relatively lower storage revenue and a seasonally strong consumer based product ramp. We do expect our non-GAAP gross margin to return to about 64% in the following quarter.  We project our GAAP operating expenses to be between $370 million and $380 million, and the non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $285 million to $290 million. We expect net interest expense to be $19 million and the non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 4.5%. We anticipate GAAP loss per diluted share in the range of $0.09 to $0.05 and a non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.13 to $0.17. Operator, please open the lines for questions. Yeah, so on the revenue side for fiscal \u201819 this businesses revenue is approximately $300 million. For fiscal \u201820 it's about the same level. The gross margin is around 50%. I think the operating expense, the operating margin within Marvell is much lower than our corporate average. So it's around the 15% to 20% of operating margin. So that's the way how you can think about this business. Yeah, that's a good question. So on the Huawei side you know its mid-single digit impact. So in Q2 we have assumed no Huawei shipment for the remaining of the quarter and going forward. So from that perspective, Huawei revenue is complete out after the balance development.  And when you think about it from the operating expense perspective right, at first we have to invest in our portfolio and the opportunity to address across all different product lines, different regions. Huawei is only one like mid-single digit revenue customers. So we don't think this Huawei ban will impact our investment level, and of course we are very mindful, we are managing discretionary expense to make sure, you know we are disciplined to manage OpEx. So that's the way how we are thinking about. We are going to manage it through this Huawei issue and make sure we drive the long term revenue growth and the margin expansion. Yeah on the gross margin side, maybe I would add to the question you asked on the gross margin side. If you look at our Q2 growth margin there are a few headwinds that impact gross margin. The Huawei ban certainly has some impact, but also we do have a seasonal strong consumer related product brand, which actually has bigger impact. So when you look at going back to Q3, that season impact is going to come down from a mix perspective.  So we do expect our gross margin to back above 64%. And as Matt mentioned earlier, we are not changing our long term target model. We continue to believe we will be able to drive our gross margin to go up going forward. Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. I think of the simple way to look at it is Huawei is about mid-single digit of our revenue, so when you look at your model, the seasonality for Q3, Q4 the simple way to do it, just take out mid-single digit revenue out from the ramp, the typical seasonal ramp from the rest of the quarter will be fine. Hey Ross, this is Jean. So I'll add some color, right. So when you look at this sequentially, we do see we have a diversified product lines and networking from security, switch, PHY. All those things are actually growing sequentially, which offset the Huawei impact and we're actually very pleased actually with all the networking product to the classical mobile side. The design wins continue to ramp up with different other customers across you know both major OEMs and broad customers outside of China. So that's really what's happening sequentially. Yes, our current assumption is really just to take out this one particular Chinese customer's revenue going forward. Matt mentioned it during his prepared remarks about the potential impact from our other customers. They get impacted which will come to impact us. We are not going to be able to estimate at this point what it means. It's just something we're mindful, but it's not in our current assumption and forecast. Yes. ': I think, if you think about it, our first priorities that we think we have a tremendous financial flexibility to both buyback some shares and also pay down the debt. So, that will be our focus of cost in the longer term. You know our capital allocation policy has not changed. Yes. It will take some time right and the way to think about it is for any new design wins that we are going to get, the gross margin is going to be very similar to Marvell's corporate average. So when you start to mix the platforms over time, it's going to migrated to our current gross margin, but it will take time. Remember, all those things have very long cycle, typically the last five years or beyond sometimes, but we are very confident over time it's going to get there. Secondly right, it's operationally \u2013 we have a really strong operational team. We do think once we integrate Avera into Marvell, we're going to have the opportunity to improve cost over sales, and that you also help the margin improvement going forward. So we'll provide you all detailed update when we close the transaction. But we do think we'll have the opportunity to migrate their gross margin to close to ours over time. The Wi-Fi. No, we don't provide that kind of details, right, because we also have a fiber channel in that business and some of the other product lines. So the way we look at it is actually from \u2013 and the market perspective, we look at the client, we look at the enterprise data center, and periodically we'll provide you with the details of how we are migrating to increasingly address the enterprise and the data center market. That's how we look at it going forward. Yeah, so first on the Huawei question, right, the ban happened two weeks into our quarter, so we did not ship too much to then during the first two weeks of the quarter. And if you look back into the last few quarters, it's very difficult for us to tell how much inventory they are building, but our assessment is we believe the run rate business of Huawei is around the mid-single digit numbers of our revenue, so that's how we think about it. Secondly, on the operating expense question, I think we continue to target asset in Q4 fiscal \u201820. We'll get to close to $280 million operating expense, that's how we are targeting and I think our team has done a great job to manage OpEx each quarter. We'll continue to be disciplined in managing the OpEx to get to our target level."

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Ashish Saran, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO.  \n I would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements.  \n During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our website in the Investor Relations section. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt? \nMatthew Murphy: Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a recap of Marvell's highlights for fiscal year 2021. Our GAAP revenue was $2.97 billion, GAAP gross margin was 50.1% and GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.41. On a non-GAAP basis, our gross margin was 63.3% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.92. Our consolidated revenue grew 10% year-on-year, led by our networking business, which grew 22% year-on-year. Revenue growth, combined with strong operating leverage from our business model, enabled non-GAAP EPS to grow 39% year-on-year. I am very pleased with our outstanding performance during what has been an otherwise challenging year.  \n Our growth initiatives in 5G, cloud and automotive drove results in these key end markets, which collectively more than doubled in revenue from the prior year to represent more than 25% of fiscal year 2021 revenue. We are really pleased with the performance of Avera and Aquantia, who both delivered revenue above our expectations. We successfully completed the integration of both businesses and overachieved on our synergy targets. \n We also made great strides with our technology platform, announcing the jump to 5-nanometer and along with it, the industry's first 112 gig SerDes for cloud data center infrastructure. This move was a direct result of our multiyear strategic shift to focus on data infrastructure and brings our process node cadence to the cutting edge. The power of our 5-nanometer platform and the benefits it provides for customers is evident in our opportunity funnel, which has grown significantly since we adopted this new node. The activity level on 5-nanometer continues to accelerate, and we have already secured multiple leading edge design wins, each meaningful from a revenue perspective.  \n Our advanced technology is also a key enabler of our custom ASIC offering, which has continued to gain momentum, particularly in cloud. Following on from the design win we announced last quarter, activity levels continue to increase, and we are now involved in advanced discussions with multiple hyperscale data center customers. Our ability to offer customization, coupled with Marvell's leading standard product IP, has proven to be highly compelling to cloud customers.  \n Given its strategic importance, let me provide some more detail on the evolution of the custom ASIC model, bringing to light some of the key trends that make the opportunity so compelling. Traditionally, the primary customer base for custom ASICs has been large system OEMs whose core business is developing hardware to sell as a product. These customers design their own system hardware and build unique technology into the hardware itself through custom chip development to differentiate their products. We do much of the chip design directly and work with a semiconductor partner to license IP and manage the physical layout in front and back-end manufacturing.  \n Today, in addition to these system customers, hyperscale data center operators are also designing their own silicon. And I'm often asked if this trend is good or bad for Marvell. We believe this trend is very good for us as we believe we are ideally positioned to help them solve their unique challenges. Their core business is the cloud service they provide, not the hardware itself. They are building custom hardware because they need incredibly efficient and optimized infrastructure. As a result, they are looking for a semiconductor collaboration that goes well beyond the traditional custom ASIC model and allows them to leverage IP that the silicon partner already has available.  \n The design is typically done in true partnership, with the customer focusing on the portions proprietary to their use cases and Marvell bringing our own unique compute, security, networking and storage IP to the table. Therefore, the end solution is a semi-custom design, which represents the best of both worlds and provides a faster time to market. Because these engagements use our IP, we believe this leads to a more strategic and valuable relationship with these key customers.  \n In addition, compute is becoming increasingly important in this market as hyperscalers are looking to move beyond standard x86 servers and integrate custom ARM-based compute solutions into their architecture. As this trend accelerates, Marvell should be an even more important partner. Our long history in successfully developing and delivering multiple generations of highly complex, multi-core ARM-based processors, including server processors, is unique in the industry.  \n Marvell is emerging as an ideal partner for these customers, and our recent cloud engagements involve deep engineering collaboration on all key aspects of design, including chip architecture, memory density, high-speed SerDes integration, advanced packaging, power optimization and flexible processor implementation.  \n Now let me move on to our quarterly results and expectations. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $798 million, $13 million above the midpoint of guidance, growing 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi, year-on-year revenue growth was even greater at 15%. Our GAAP income per diluted share was $0.02. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.29, growing 16% sequentially and 71% year-over-year.  \n As expected, supply constraints limited our ability to fully meet the growing demand for our networking products. We also saw strong demand for our storage products, which drove the upside in revenue relative to the midpoint of our guidance. Although these industry-wide supply shortages are now well known, I expect that they may still be a topic of particular interest during our Q&A session. So in anticipation of your questions, let me provide as much detail as I can for you now.  \n As you are aware, despite or perhaps more accurately due to the impact from COVID-19, demand has grown significantly across a range of semiconductor end markets as data infrastructure has become even more critical to the world's economy. However, the supply chain was not completely prepared for the surge in demand and needs time to increase capacity. While we are confident that the industry will respond to these challenges, we anticipate a supply gap for at least through fiscal 2022.  \n Lead times have extended across the board. We are seeing shortages for multilayer complex substrates, IC packaging capacity and fab constraints in certain technology nodes important for our products. From our vantage point, the increase in demand we are experiencing for our 5G, cloud and auto products appears closely tied to the long-term secular growth drivers present in these end markets. This, combined with the sole source nature of most of our design wins, would suggest that most of the demand we are not able to satisfy in the near-term is not perishable. \n Marvell is collaborating even more closely with our customers to manage demand forecast over an extended time horizon, and our operations team is continuing to drive our suppliers to match supply appropriately to mitigate impacts and minimize disruptions. In addition, we are taking extraordinary measures, including securing capacity in advance over much longer than typical time periods. And we are working with customers to get their assistance in helping absorb some of the incremental costs associated with prioritizing their continuity of supply.  \n Let's now discuss our 2 businesses in more detail. First, in our networking business, revenue during the fourth quarter was $439 million, consistent with our outlook of being flattish to the prior quarter. Year-on-year growth remained robust, with revenue growing 24% compared to the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi. The year-on-year growth in networking was led by our 5G and cloud businesses. In addition, revenue from our Ethernet switch and PHY portfolio grew significantly as new design wins started to ramp.  \n Let me provide some color on sequential revenue movements in networking. In 5G, we delivered our sixth straight quarter of sequential revenue growth. This growth was driven by standard and semi-custom product shipments to Samsung and Nokia, partially offset by a decline in 5G ASICs as deployments in China take a pause. Looking past the typical lumpy nature of individual regional rollouts, 5G infrastructure deployments are expected to continue to strengthen worldwide.  \n As an example, the U.S. recently concluded the first phase of the C-band spectrum auction. This was the highest grossing spectrum auction ever held in the U.S. with gross proceeds exceeding $80 billion. A record level of interest is a clear indicator of the potential revenue opportunities carriers expect from 5G technology. Other regions around the world are also opening up spectrum for 5G services and wireless industry experts expect deployments to gather strength later this year.  \n We launched our open RAN platform in December 2020 and are gaining traction in the marketplace. For example, we recently announced that we are joining the Evenstar program, and we'll be working with Facebook connectivity to provide a 5G open RAN distributed unit design. This design will be based on our leading OCTEON Fusion baseband processors and ARM-based OCTEON multi-core DPUs. Evenstar DU design will enable a new generation of RAN suppliers to deliver high-performance, cost-optimized, interoperable DU products to the rapidly expanding open RAN ecosystem.  \n We recently announced that Fujitsu will be using our industry-leading OCTEON Fusion baseband processors in its new 5G base stations and also plan to engage with us on open RAN distributed unit products. They are the second 5G regional customer I referenced last quarter.  \n In cloud networking, we benefited from strong customer demand in the fourth quarter for our smartNIC DPUs, while the cloud ASIC declined as expected. Looking forward, we expect to continue benefiting from the secular growth in cloud CapEx on semiconductor solutions for data processing.  \n Turning to our automotive business. Quarterly revenues crossed into the double-digit million run rate, driven by the ramp of multiple Ethernet design wins in model year 2021 vehicles. Engagements are expanding at additional large OEMs and bookings have continued to strengthen. We believe that fiscal 2022 is shaping up to be a breakout year for this business.\n The fourth quarter was robust for our Ethernet switch and PHY business with product ramps at multiple customers. The design wins we won over the last couple of years are now starting to ramp, and we expect these will contribute higher levels of revenue as we progress into fiscal 2022.  \n Let me now discuss the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 for our networking business. Reflecting strong demand, despite continued supply constraints, we project revenues to grow close to 10% on a sequential basis and continued strong year-on-year growth exceeding 20%. We expect this growth to be broad-based, led by our cloud DPUs, standard and semi-custom 5G solutions, automotive products and Ethernet networking solutions, partially offset by softness in 5G ASICs.  \n Turning now to our storage business. Storage revenue for the fourth quarter was better than expected across all product lines, growing 18% sequentially to $326 million. This was a very strong quarter for our storage business with 10% year-on-year growth, driven by our custom SSD controller and cloud HDD products. I'm very pleased with the tremendous progress we have made over the last few years in enabling high-capacity nearline HDDs, which are critical for cloud customers. We have extended our long-standing relationship with Toshiba, and we recently announced that our controllers and preamps are powering their new 18-terabyte cloud scale HDDs.  \n Toshiba's 18-terabyte products deliver industry-leading data storage capacity by utilizing MAMR technology and advanced signal processing developed in close partnership with Marvell. The close coupling of Marvell's rechannel and preamplifier IP enables leading edge features and HDD capacity to extend Toshiba's position in the cloud data center market. \n Let me now provide some additional color on storage revenue on a sequential basis. In the fourth quarter, our custom SSD controller revenue benefited from the ongoing ramp at a Tier 1 OEM as well as the initial ramp at a major cloud customer. In HDDs, demand was strong across multiple end markets, including enterprise, smart video, retail and client, and our business benefited from aggregate HDD unit TAM growth of about 10% sequentially. Our revenue from cloud HDDs also grew on strong customer demand for our products.  \n In our fiber channel business, demand recovered significantly from the COVID-19 impacts earlier in the year. Our operations team was able to increase supply to help our OEMs restock and deliver more product to their customers.  \n Looking to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we project a seasonal decline in storage controller demand. In addition, after last quarter's inventory replenishment by customers, we expect a more than seasonal decline in fiber channel demand. As a result, after a very strong fourth quarter, we expect our storage revenue to decline in the low teens sequentially on a percentage basis. However, we expect a continued year-on-year growth of over 10% in the first quarter.  \n In closing, needless to say, last year was a very challenging period as we adjusted to operating in the presence of a pandemic. It was almost exactly a year ago today when shelter-in-place policies were coming into effect and we're in the midst of taking action to protect our 5,000-plus employees and an extended support team of contractors and suppliers. None of us really knew how the year would evolve or how the pandemic would impact our productivity or the demand for our products and technology. I can now look back and applaud a strong performance by the Marvell team in the face of adversity: incredible program execution, record design win achievement, stronger customer relationships, double-digit revenue growth and significant margin expansion. I'm very proud of our employees, and I would like to thank them for their collective efforts in positioning Marvell to emerge even stronger from the pandemic.  \n We ended fiscal 2021 on a strong note, and we are kicking off fiscal 2022 with solid growth expectations, guiding revenue at the midpoint for the first quarter to grow 15% year-on-year despite ongoing supply challenges. We expect strong year-on-year growth from both our networking and storage businesses in the first quarter. Non-GAAP EPS at the midpoint for the first quarter is now -- is projected to grow by 50% year-on-year, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business model.  \n In fiscal 2022, we expect revenue growth from custom SSD controllers, preamplifiers, automotive Ethernet and enterprise networking, in addition to our expanding 5G and cloud businesses, which is still early in their growth cycles. Our team is also focused on closing key design wins from the large funnel of 5-nanometer and cloud engagements I discussed earlier. \n We are getting closer to completing the Inphi transaction and as part of integration planning, we recently concluded a series of joint strategic planning sessions. The conclusion of these meetings, our teams walked away more excited than ever about the depth of technology and the level of talent across the combined company. The addition of Inphi broadens the opportunity set for the combined company, and this will be a key factor in setting future investment priorities. As a reminder, the closing of the Inphi transaction remains subject to obtaining shareholder and regulatory approvals and satisfying other closing conditions. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. \nJean Hu: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the fourth quarter and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  \n Revenue in the fourth quarter was $798 million, [ $13 million ] above the midpoint of our guidance. Networking represented 55% of our revenue, and storage contributing 41%. Revenue from other accounted for 4% of our revenue. GAAP gross margin was 52.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.9% of revenue, both consistent with our guidance.  \n GAAP operating expenses were $423 million and include the cost of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal segments and acquisition and divestiture-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expense were $283 million, just above midpoint due to slightly higher project costs. GAAP operating loss was $2 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $226 million or 28.4% of revenue. For the fourth quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $0.02. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.29.  \n Now turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $158 million. We returned $40 million to shareholders through dividend payment. During the quarter, we paid down $150 million of our term loan and exit the quarter with $748 million in cash and cash equivalents and total debt outstanding of $1.2 billion. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.5x on a trailing 12-month basis. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to the pending acquisition of Inphi.  \n For the full fiscal year of 2021, we returned a total of $186 million to shareholders through $161 million in dividends and $25 million in share repurchases. In addition, we paid down $250 million of our term loan. During fiscal 2021, we also generated strong cash flow from operations of $817 million.  \n Turning to our guidance. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $800 million, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 52.5%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 63.5%. We project our GAAP operating expense to be approximately $391 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. We expect our basic weighted average share outstanding will be 677 million, and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 619 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.05 per share on the low end to an income of $0.05 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.23 to $0.31.  \n Finally, 2 housekeeping points. As a reminder, our GAAP EPS is calculated using basic weighted average shares outstanding when there's GAAP net loss, and they're calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding when there is GAAP net income. Non-GAAP EPS is calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding. In terms of expenses, you should expect us to continue to invest in our long-term growth with disciplined resource allocation. We expect our operating expense growth to be well below our revenue growth. Our OpEx increase year-over-year will be primarily due to employee merit increase and the normal inflation on items such as EDA 2.  \n Our outlook for operating expense in the first quarter reflects the seasonal increase in payroll taxes. This seasonal effect is expected to dissipate in the second quarter, offset by a partial quarter of merit increase. The full impact from merit increase will be present in the third quarter. By the time we exit the fiscal year, we estimate our non-GAAP operating expense in the fourth quarter will increase in the range of 3% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. \n Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A questions. Thank you. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan. \nHarlan Sur: Appreciate the commentary on supply constraints. And I'm not asking the team to endorse higher revenues in the second half of the year, but I would expect China 5G spend to come back in the second half. 5G outside of China remains strong. Sony is going to double their PS5 shipments this year, and then you have continued momentum in cloud. But if the backlog supported higher revenues in the second half, let's say, 10% higher versus the $800 million in April, is the team confident that you can support quarter-on-quarter revenue growth through the second half? Or do you think that, that will be a challenge just given the tight wafer substrate and assembly and test capacity constraints? \nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Thanks, Harlan. Yes. No, I think you highlighted some of the growth drivers. So just a few comments. I think the first is we are -- we have been planning for growth in our FY '22. I think we're off to a good start for the year. If you look at our Q1 guidance alone, it's going to be up 15% year-over-year versus a year ago. \n We've got some very strong secular growth drivers. You mentioned 5G, and there's certainly some positive signs, especially for the second half there. We have our cloud business, which is also growing on a secular basis as well as our new product ramps. And actually, we also have automotive, which is really off to a good start this year, and we see that continuing. So we've got that as a tailwind behind us. \n I'd say we've been able to drive growth, even if you look at FY '21, pretty consistently. We've been growing each quarter, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Q4, we were able to actually exceed guidance and make up -- service some of the demand that was there. So that was a positive side. \n I think -- so I think the message is we've been delivering well. There's been a new sort of increased surge, and that's really where we're focused is working with our supply chain partners to be able to capture that upside above and beyond the growth rate that we've already been achieving. So bottom line answer to your question is I'm very confident that we can grow revenue in the second half based on the capacity that we've secured and worked hard with our supply chain partners to put in place. And we're also going to look to see if there's upside opportunity to pursue that as well. \n And that's not only for this year, but as I look even into our FY '23, we're starting to work with our supply chain partners there as well to really give them advanced notice because we see those trends like 5G, cloud and automotive being even stronger in the out years with new products ramping, new customers coming online, and we're pretty excited about our future there. So yes, I think we'll be in -- we're working hard on the -- on all fronts. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America. \nVivek Arya: Matt, when I look back at this earnings season, most semiconductor companies reported and guided to trends well ahead of expectation, right, so much so that investors, right, have often complained about overshipments or pull-in of orders. But when I compare your Q4 and Q1 against expectations, it's been more measured. I'm curious, how much of this would you attribute to a different end market mix, right? How much of this is due to supply constraints? And then more importantly, what changes or gets better the rest of the year so you can start to accelerate your sales growth? \nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Yes. I think, Vivek, it's a couple of things. I think, first, it has a lot to do with the end markets that we're in. I mean, fundamentally, remember, we're one of the only pure-play infrastructure companies. So we don't have consumer demand that's sort of very volatile, maybe good 1 quarter, maybe not so good in 2 quarters. We don't have a lot of demand that sort of comes and goes. We tend to -- and this is sort of by design, by the way, the business model that we've put together is to bring together these various end applications and drive consistent and ideally predictable growth. So while we may not be as flashy in some quarters as certain companies that really have some explosive demand, but then maybe it abates later, we're focused on slow and steady wins today and continuing to execute and grow our company quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. \n Certainly, there's opportunities out there to secure some upside, and we're working on that. But I think even if you saw in Q4, for us, we were quite pleased with the overachievement on revenue, and we're very comfortable with the first quarter guide as well. So I think it's more around we've been one of the faster growers in the last few quarters and also our end-market dynamics. Ideally, we'll deliver more repeatable and sustainable long-term growth with maybe less quarter-to-quarter variation. That's been the strategy. \nVivek Arya: And anything changed in the second half versus what you have seen in the last 2 quarters? What gets better from here? \nMatthew Murphy: In terms of the demand or the supply? \nVivek Arya: Yes, on the demand and the market -- end market mix. \nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Yes. Well, I think a couple of things are going on. If you -- as I indicated in my comments earlier with Harlan, we certainly have -- 5G in the second half will continue to accelerate. We have -- there are new geographies coming online. We believe that the U.S. will -- shows very good prospects for the second half. We believe that China as well will go through their digestion phase, and then you have Japan and you have new countries, even India is talking about potentially pulling in their spectrum auction. So that's all positive. So we expect that to continue. \n Our cloud business continues to grow, and we see that continuing, both on a secular basis as well as new products, including our ASIC storage and our DPUs, which are doing quite well in terms of smartNICs. Automotive, the same thing. We've got a good ramp going with our calendar -- our model year, sorry, '21 ramps. We've got more to come in model year '22 with additional OEMs coming online as well as expanded content. And even some of the new automotive, I call it, the new breed of automotive OEMs, the EV-only focused companies, really aggressively adopting our solutions. So we're positive there.  \n And then we've got custom SSD controllers, both for cloud as well as for our system OEM. And finally, on top of that, our enterprise business has done extremely well if you look at -- which was surprising, but if you look at even our results in last year, that business with our switch and PHY products grew significantly, primarily on our own product cycle, and we also are very optimistic about that as well. So there's a number of good things that are happening in our business, Vivek, both from an end market as well as a product cycle standpoint. And so as Harlan pointed out, we've got to go, just continue to make sure we've got the right supply profile to meet that, but we're working hard on that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS. \nTimothy Arcuri: Matt, I just had a question on the storage business. It was well above seasonal Q4 and a little below seasonal for fiscal Q1. I guess I'm a little surprised that it will be below seasonal for fiscal Q1 while all your customers are talking about controllers being on allocation. So I guess I wanted to just talk about that. And then I was wondering if maybe you can talk about what sort of you see as normal season in fiscal Q2. I think, typically, it's up like mid-singles. Do you also have flatter tail happening as well? So can you just sort of talk about those 2 factors? \nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Maybe, Jean, I'll have you answer the first part on storage. And then, Tim, I'll have you repeat your question, you broke up a little bit on the second part of it. But Jean, why don't you go ahead and give us some comments around storage? \nJean Hu: Yes. On storage side, in Q4, we really had a really strong quarter, and the performance really is a combination of our own product cycle and also strong end-market demand across the board. So in HDD and the fiber channel, certainly, we see the demand in nearline, which our business performed really well, and also just broad demand for -- on the client side, too. \n On fiber channel, we do see the demand bouncing back and also the customers are restocking because of the supply challenge in the last year has caused a lot of problems in fiber channel. So fiber channel is a little bit lumpy. \n And then if you look at the Q1, frankly, the storage controller business, when you look at HDD and SSD, they are actually quite seasonal. It's declining quarter-over-quarter, very consistent with the broad market. The fiber channel is where it becomes really lumpy. The Q4 performance is pretty good and strong, but the customers also are restocking. So we do see Q1 fiber channel, again, is declining much more than seasonal. But if you look at the overall, in the longer term, fiber channel business actually is quite stable. So the quarter-over-quarter lumpiness is definitely exaggerated last year by the supply chain constraints. I think you need to repeat your second question because we did not hear it clearly. \nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. You can hear me now. So I guess the question was just given all that movement, how you think about what normal seasonal is for fiscal Q2, like it's typically up sort of mid-singles. Is that the right way to think about it into fiscal Q2? \nMatthew Murphy: Yes. I think we'll -- I think, Tim, so first of all, I think we're -- we have a -- I don't even know what the new normal is in storage anywhere -- anymore, but there certainly is a seasonality effect to that, but we're not really guiding out that far at this point. What I want to emphasize, though, is that even on the sort of lumpiness of fiber channel, which has definitely started, I think, with the shelter-in-place orders that went into effect earlier in 2020, there's just been a -- it's been a lumpier business than normal, and so it had a very good Q4. And then, obviously, we've guided it down for Q1. \n But if you just sort of step back, storage overall for Marvell is up 10% year-over-year in Q1 is what we're guiding. So -- despite some of the lumpiness. And this is a higher sort of beta business than the rest of our businesses. We're still pretty pleased with the trajectory of this business. And we do expect the fiber channel portion to normalize throughout this year, assuming that there's no more supply chain surprises. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nJohn Pitzer: Matt, glad to see the 10% sequential growth expected in networking in the April quarter. But I'm kind of curious, when you look back at the January quarter, I'm a little surprised that networking was down sequential. I mean, it was essentially flat in line with your guide, but just given the level of delinquencies, did the supply problem get worse? Or is this maybe a function that when you look at the networking business, there's portions that are just tied to campus and enterprise? And then there's sort of the growthy parts of your business. I guess, that the growthy parts grow sequentially and there was an enterprise overhang. As you look out throughout the balance of the year, how do you think about just a reopening trade around enterprise and the impact it's going to have on your networking business? \nMatthew Murphy: Yes. No, I think as we've said, the supply impacts we've seen have been more pronounced in the networking business. So that has limited our ability to deliver upside, like we want to. Even then, you got to remember, too, our -- the compare is a little bit tough because we did have a very strong Q3. I mean, you've got to now go back to sort of what are you comparing it to. If you remember, Q3 was up very significantly from our Q2. And then year-over-year, it was up a ton. So the flat compare, while we wish we could have done a little better, it's still, on an annual basis, still growing really well. \n I wouldn't really break out that there was sort of weakness in one or the other. I think we're coming off a big Q3 and then also the 5G was up and enterprise has continued to be up, and we've actually seen, from a year ago, everything growing. So I think it's more of a sequential issue. And certainly, we're pleased with the Q1, 10% up, and that business continues to do very well for us. \nJohn Pitzer: And then, Matt, just on the cost side, how much are you absorbing versus being able to pass on? Is it material to gross margins? And is that something that sticks around for most of this fiscal year? Or is that something that could reverse itself in the second half? \nJean Hu: John, this is Jean. Yes, I'll take this question. So definitely, as Matt mentioned earlier, we are working with the customers to share the increased cost. And the way we're looking at it is our first priority is to really meet customer demand, especially with the increased demand for our product. As far as the gross margin, we are very pleased with our Q4 performance and the Q1 guide. And the Q1 guide, if you look at it, it's primarily driven by mix and we'll continue to improve our gross margin to our target level. We discussed during our Investor Day, which is 65%. I think the pace of that improvement is probably different in today's supply-constrained environment versus a normal environment because we do want to make sure we meet customers' demand, increase the demand on this current supply-constraint situation. So the pace will be a little bit different, not as we expected during our last Investor Day. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis from Barclays. \nBlayne Curtis: Just I just want to ask, I know you answered a lot on the storages and said it would be short all year. You did miss some shipments in January. And I thought at the time you were thinking of catching up in April. So as you look to the guidance of 10% for networking, one, I just wanted to know, you're catching up on some of those January shipments within that 10%. And then I think I heard you say basically everything but 5G ASICs would be up. I was wondering if you could give us any more color as to what the primary drivers of that growth is. \nMatthew Murphy: Well, yes, on the second part, you're right, other than 5G ASICs, which were mostly tied to the China deployments in 5G, which were extremely strong in calendar '20. And we're seeing that digestion now. Yes, the rest of it is up, but there's not necessarily a catch-up per se, in Q1. I mean, we are seeing demand increase. And I think we've -- we see revenue going up and we see -- so I'd say it's more demand-driven than just, oh, well, we've caught up and now the demand is flat. We actually have a pretty robust demand picture for that particular business, both year-on-year and sequentially. \nJean Hu: And overall, to just add to what Matt said, overall, we continue to have a similar delinquency, right? So it's certainly supply chain constraint. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore. \nChristopher Muse: I guess to clarify, Jean, are you implying OpEx in fiscal '22 is growing roughly 2.5%? And then I guess for the primary question, Matt, can you discuss your engagement with hyperscale customers? Can you kind of walk us through the initial work on perhaps discrete ASICs and how that kind of relationship is evolving to perhaps more custom solutions across increased areas of processing? \nJean Hu: Yes, it's our OpEx year-over-year, you can think about, it's around 3%, the typical inflation year-over-year. We are managing our resource allocation to ensure we continue to invest in all the growth platforms we have. So that's how you can model it. \nMatthew Murphy: Yes. C.J., I'll take your other question. So I think the -- if you even go back to our purchase of Avera, there was really 2 -- we had a thesis there on 2 fronts. One was to be more relevant in the 5G market and be able to offer full custom design capability along with the semi-custom that we had developed with our lead customer. And as you've seen, that's gone really well. The second was that the recognition that in the cloud hyperscale market that more and more of the -- particularly compute-based solutions, were going to go to full custom or even semi-custom, but a need to really have a full ASIC capability. \n And these are -- there's a range of applications, by the way. These things could be anything from AI or ML chips to server-class CPUs to networking products, smartNICs, so there's a variety of applications. And as I said in my prepared remarks, this trend is here to stay, and we think it's good for us. I think there is a world that, that's post x86 or certainly coexist with it where more and more of the compute and more and more of these solutions are moving to very, very customized products. And we have all the ideal pieces to support that in terms of our process technology, our in-house IPs, like our SerDes, both for short reach and medium and long-reach at the highest frequencies, including 112 gig. And our ability to really partner closely and deeply and be flexible in our business model as well. \n And what I mean by that is we can do standard ASICs that are the traditional model you think of. But increasingly, what I'm seeing is the engagements with the cloud companies are really more partnership-oriented where it's solutioning together and it's proposing architectures and proposing 4 different ways to do something and then coming up with a model that really suits their needs. And so I think sort of our go-to-market plus our technology road map and then having all these key pieces, whether it's networking IP, very, very strong compute portfolio with all of our history from the Cavium side and ARM-based processors to security, to storage. And then within PHY coming in, obviously, the optical connectivity. So I think we're going to -- we can be an ideal partner here, and we think this is going to be a very big opportunity, and it's going to be one that's here to stay. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. \nRoss Seymore: Just a clarification, then a question. The clarification, just, Jean, usually, you give a little color on what the other segment is going to do. But the main question for Matt is on the 5G side of things. I think everybody knows the digestion period that's going on in China now, some of the transitions going on geographically and the optimism people have in the second half, but you're really outperforming that -- during that transition period that we have right now and it sounds like you'll continue to in the back half. \n So I guess what I'm getting at is when you think about your company-specific drivers, separated from the market as a whole, improving in the back half, do you think that outperformance you're delivering now accelerates or decelerates? And what are the drivers of that performance above and beyond what the end market itself is going to do? \nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Why don't I take the 5G question, then Jean, you can comment on other. So yes, Ross, I think you're right. I mean, we've we performed really well on the cycle. We had 6 quarters of sequential revenue growth in 5G, and we were able to power through as new products ramped. And new customers came online when some others maybe felt different paces of digestion. So I think we're pleased with that outperformance in that run. \n The China, in particular, deployments last year were very large. And so as you pointed out, I think a number of companies are going through a similar digestion, but we do expect this business to accelerate and continue to outperform for a couple of reasons. I think one is our lead customer has certainly gained momentum in some of the markets that we'll be ramping in the second half plus in calendar '22. So that's a positive sign. And there's also -- within them, there's programs where we have new sockets where content is also -- it's new content for us. \n And then we have our second customer, Nokia, which this year will be our first full year -- not even a full year. It's ramping this year into production with our baseband product. It will be a full year in '22. And then we have additional content with that customer, which was all publicly announced last year that will start to phase in after that. \n So I think there's -- yes, there's a number of Marvell -- very specific Marvell drivers with some of the most important companies in this space. And then even looking beyond that horizon, we've got really good traction with our ORAN initiatives. And we're in the mix on a number of very important sockets across all the OEMs that will keep driving growth here. So we feel very good about our 5G position that it can continue to outperform and accelerate going forward. \nJean Hu: Yes, Ross, on the other question, just a reminder, other is largely for our printer business today. And quarter-over-quarter, it's actually going to be just up a couple of million dollars sequentially. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. \nTore Svanberg: Yes. And I'll keep it to the one question. So Matt, you referenced some strategic meetings with Inphi. I know the deal is not going to close for a few more months. But from those meetings, could you perhaps give us a few examples on how the 2 companies are combining the IP to go out and target some new opportunities? \nMatthew Murphy: Yes. So yes, let me give you a little background on what we did, how we're thinking about it and maybe some broad brush strokes on the opportunities. Certainly, we're not -- we're still 2 separate companies. So I think more to come on that, Tore. And some of the opportunities as well, some are pronounced and some are nuanced, but the bottom line is first of all, Ford and Lloyd, the founder of N5, put together just an incredible team. I mean we've now gotten exposure through this process, which was great. Their key engineering leadership, their key product marketing people, their business unit leaders and also same on our side. So it was really a very, very powerful, I'd say, joint meeting where we reviewed all of our various businesses, and we were able to identify a number of exciting areas where we certainly can work together. \n In general, the technology is obviously very complementary, but we do sit in the same systems. And certainly, there's things like process road map and customers where we can go in together. So I'd say the net -- and the way we -- the reason we did this is we're really approaching this as a merger with the Inphi team. And so we're going to bring them in, and we're going to look at really the combined company spending and identify jointly the best opportunities to get the highest ROI and drive the best top line growth. \n And so what we found is we believe this is going to give us an opportunity to allocate some additional spending in some very targeted areas within the Inphi team to actually accelerate some of their ambitions and growth. And I can tell you from our side and my entire management team, multiple layers down, is very excited about the team coming over and their product lines and their prospects. And I look forward in future meetings to actually start articulating some of these in a lot more detail. But I'd just end it by saying thematically, combined, I think we've become much more important and much more relevant in the cloud hyperscale market than either company would have been independently. \n And I think, together, given the system-level complexity that these companies are dealing with, the cutting-edge performance they need, the deep sort of real technical and strategic partnerships they're looking for, we believe that this can be as important and strategic a market and probably larger market combined than 5G. And so I think we're -- our strategy we laid out at the Investor Day, which was a little bit before Inphi, but certainly was on our mind, which was really think about 5G as this wave of growth that we're seeing right now, the cloud then following that. And certainly, Inphi layering in will accelerate our opportunity there. And then we have a lot more to share at a later date as well on our automotive opportunities, which is starting with Ethernet, but it's now branching out into other aspects of Marvell, including storage and security, compute, ASICs, and some other additional networking type of solutions. So all in all, I think the combined company is going to be very, very relevant in this cloud market, especially. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. \nChristopher Rolland: Going to the ASIC side of the business, maybe piggybacking on some that have already been asked, but maybe you can talk about where this new design pipeline is coming from? Is it storage? Is it networking? Is it compute? Where are you getting the most traction there? And then as we look out, let's say, 5 years, Matt, what percent of your business do you think or expect or would like ASICs to be? \nMatthew Murphy: Yes. I think -- let me give you the backdrop. So I think the exciting part of our ASIC opportunity, and I would even broaden that to say our broader, I'd call it, advanced technology opportunity, of which ASIC is certainly an important piece. This would be what I would call our 5 -- just think about our 5-nanometer platform as its own potential growth opportunity. We publicly announced this in August of 2020, but we have been securing designs in this technology as early as end of 2019 type of time frame, early 2020. And so since that time frame, we've grown this design opportunity funnel to be very significant size relative to anything we've seen before on a single sort of process node. \n And it's very broad, Chris. I think that's sort of the point I want to make. I think there are -- if you go by market, certainly, there are 5G designs that we've already won and secured as an example there, and there's a large pipeline in front of us as people move from sort of 12-, 14-, 16-nanometer type of products, and they want to go all the way down. There are significant cloud hyperscale opportunities. Some of those I mentioned earlier. But also in enterprise, we've had good success in promoting our OCTEON-based CPUs into that market. That would be more of a standard product, by the way, not a custom. \n And then even in storage, we've seen some very important customers in the storage market take a leadership role and work directly with us to develop state-of-the-art flash controllers for things like data center and enterprise applications using our 5-nanometer technology. So it's -- this is much broader, Chris, than just, oh, well, Marvell has got a 5-nanometer thing and they can go offer ASICs with a standard sort of model, and that will generate some revenue. It's really a transformational platform for us, which we're -- we could use for traditional ASICs. But increasingly, we're finding that these custom opportunities that people come and ask us for, several of them have now converted into Marvell products where we're designing the entire product based on a spec. And designing the product for them rather than -- and then, of course, there's more value that can be captured there. It's a more stickier engagement. And these are all very significant type of opportunities, in particular, in the cloud market. \n So I hope that's helpful context to sort of broaden it because certainly, we had a view maybe going back to when we bought Avera. Hey, this will be great. We can have a nice big ASIC business, but it's turned into much more than that. And yes, and we're excited to talk about that in the coming quarters as we close designs and we take advantage of the pipeline that our sales team and our business units have developed, which is extremely strong. \nChristopher Rolland: And what percent do you think it could be in 5 years? \nMatthew Murphy: That's hard to say. And I think it depends on what you mean, like is it -- how much is ASIC versus how much is semi-custom versus how much is in 5G, but this is clearly a -- this is the future growth of the company. So you should assume these things are multibillion type of opportunities for the whole platform going forward, right? I mean, this is where we're going to be the growth engine of the company. So it's very significant. These are not nichey one-off designs that we're winning that will kind of be a nice sort of headline news product, this is going to be really the driver of the company's revenue growth. So in aggregate, all of this becomes a very significant portion of our future company revenue. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. \nJoseph Moore: In terms of the constraints, I wonder if you could talk to -- you mentioned substrates as being maybe the biggest factor and then certain geometry wafers, which geometries are those? And then just as a bigger picture aspect to this, it seems like from Marchex, that networking chips in general are tighter than other things, even though there's tightness in graphics and that you have to be able to grow quite a bit. Is there something different with substrates and things like that, where this is affecting the infrastructure businesses more than it's affecting other areas? \nMatthew Murphy: Yes. I think on the first question, Joe, it's hard to say. I mean this is such a dynamic environment, right? We've been reviewing every part of the supply chain as a team for months, right? And we're finding that we solve one issue and then another one seems to appear. And if you even go back to our last earnings call, I remember there were some questions there like, tell me about the supply chain issue and you fast forward 3 months and the U.S. automotive industry is in disarray because they can't get chips, right? So things are moving at a very rapid pace. \n I will note that we're supplying quite well actually on our automotive products, so don't make that comment with Marvell. That's more of a general one. But we do see point capacity stress with complex substrates, for sure. We see some of the \"older nodes\" and what I would mean by that is this isn't sort of 5-, 7-nanometer type of things. These are more going back to, call it, 28- and above, right, that have different pain points that companies are working with. And that's where a lot of this automotive, I think, tends to sit. \n So it's -- there's not a silver bullet. It's just going to take a lot of hard work. And even things like -- I think I noted in the last call, things like wire bonders have -- those lead times have stretched. So our OSATs are just having a hard time keeping up. \n Now they're spending money, and they're certainly adding capacity, and we're engaged in that planning process to make sure we're okay, but that's maybe a little bit more detail on that side. And then what was your second question? \nJoseph Moore: Yes. No, that was basically the question is just, is there something different... \nMatthew Murphy: Oh, on the networking chips, yes. \nJoseph Moore: Yes. I mean, graphics chips are in short supply, but people are kind of growing 20% faster than they thought and then constrained at that level where it seems like the networking shortages are just as severe. We're hearing about them from your customers, but demand doesn't seem to be on that kind of crazy trajectory. \nMatthew Murphy: Yes. It's hard for me to benchmark since we're not in the graphics business. I know that's a little bit of a different scale. But certainly, the complexity level of these products when you look at just the complexity of the substrates alone, I mean, I think the number of layers, if you go to these advanced products in, call it, 14-, 16-nanometer and below, have probably doubled in terms of the complexity of the substrates. And they're just extremely large die. These are thousands of IOs and some of these die are virtually the size of a credit card. So you've just got very low die per wafer, and you got a lot of demand. And it's been difficult for people to keep up. \n There's also test constraints that the test times on these things are very long because of the complexity of the product. So there's just -- maybe that's the reason. But I run an analog business and now I run Marvell, but I've never run a graphics business. I don't... \nJoseph Moore: Yes. No I'm just trying to compare and contrast. \nMatthew Murphy: [indiscernible] about that. Yes. \nJoseph Moore: Just comparing and contrasting. That's very helpful. \nOperator: And our final question for today comes from the line of Srini Pajjuri from SMBC Nikko. \nSrinivas Pajjuri: Jean, I have a question on OpEx and also on the margins. I guess as you ramp some of this 5-nanometer designs and as you engage more in 5-nanometer, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about OpEx, if there's going to be more volatility as we go forward? And also, I guess, as we go to second half of this year and beyond, and 5G and ASICs become a bigger portion of your revenue, do you see any further opportunity to improve your gross margins from these levels? \nJean Hu: Yes. On OpEx, right, our team has done excellent job to manage operating expense. But you're right, there are some variabilities quarter-over-quarter due to the project cost and also we are working with our customer together, sometimes the customer portion of it may accelerate or push out. So there are variations, but I feel quite comfortable. Look at the overall for fiscal '22, we can manage the OpEx at the same time investing. So for instance, our Q4, our OpEx is slightly higher because of project cost, but we'll manage it overall. \n On the margin side, I think our #1 objective is really to meet the demand. We have significant opportunities for the company, and we have increased the demand across all the growth platforms, as Matt mentioned, the 5G, cloud and also automotive. So that's actually our #1 objective, and we certainly will continue to improve gross margin and make sure we get the most margin dollars out of our business. \nOperator: This does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. You may now disconnect. Good day.",

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the fourth quarter and then provide our current outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2022.  \n Revenue in the fourth quarter was $798 million, [ $13 million ] above the midpoint of our guidance. Networking represented 55% of our revenue, and storage contributing 41%. Revenue from other accounted for 4% of our revenue. GAAP gross margin was 52.8%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.9% of revenue, both consistent with our guidance.  \n GAAP operating expenses were $423 million and include the cost of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal segments and acquisition and divestiture-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expense were $283 million, just above midpoint due to slightly higher project costs. GAAP operating loss was $2 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $226 million or 28.4% of revenue. For the fourth quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $0.02. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.29.  \n Now turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $158 million. We returned $40 million to shareholders through dividend payment. During the quarter, we paid down $150 million of our term loan and exit the quarter with $748 million in cash and cash equivalents and total debt outstanding of $1.2 billion. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.5x on a trailing 12-month basis. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to the pending acquisition of Inphi.  \n For the full fiscal year of 2021, we returned a total of $186 million to shareholders through $161 million in dividends and $25 million in share repurchases. In addition, we paid down $250 million of our term loan. During fiscal 2021, we also generated strong cash flow from operations of $817 million.  \n Turning to our guidance. For the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $800 million, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 52.5%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 63.5%. We project our GAAP operating expense to be approximately $391 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $300 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. We expect our basic weighted average share outstanding will be 677 million, and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 619 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.05 per share on the low end to an income of $0.05 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.23 to $0.31.  \n Finally, 2 housekeeping points. As a reminder, our GAAP EPS is calculated using basic weighted average shares outstanding when there's GAAP net loss, and they're calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding when there is GAAP net income. Non-GAAP EPS is calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding. In terms of expenses, you should expect us to continue to invest in our long-term growth with disciplined resource allocation. We expect our operating expense growth to be well below our revenue growth. Our OpEx increase year-over-year will be primarily due to employee merit increase and the normal inflation on items such as EDA 2.  \n Our outlook for operating expense in the first quarter reflects the seasonal increase in payroll taxes. This seasonal effect is expected to dissipate in the second quarter, offset by a partial quarter of merit increase. The full impact from merit increase will be present in the third quarter. By the time we exit the fiscal year, we estimate our non-GAAP operating expense in the fourth quarter will increase in the range of 3% to 4% on a year-over-year basis. \n Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A questions. Thank you. Yes. On storage side, in Q4, we really had a really strong quarter, and the performance really is a combination of our own product cycle and also strong end-market demand across the board. So in HDD and the fiber channel, certainly, we see the demand in nearline, which our business performed really well, and also just broad demand for -- on the client side, too. \n On fiber channel, we do see the demand bouncing back and also the customers are restocking because of the supply challenge in the last year has caused a lot of problems in fiber channel. So fiber channel is a little bit lumpy. \n And then if you look at the Q1, frankly, the storage controller business, when you look at HDD and SSD, they are actually quite seasonal. It's declining quarter-over-quarter, very consistent with the broad market. The fiber channel is where it becomes really lumpy. The Q4 performance is pretty good and strong, but the customers also are restocking. So we do see Q1 fiber channel, again, is declining much more than seasonal. But if you look at the overall, in the longer term, fiber channel business actually is quite stable. So the quarter-over-quarter lumpiness is definitely exaggerated last year by the supply chain constraints. I think you need to repeat your second question because we did not hear it clearly. John, this is Jean. Yes, I'll take this question. So definitely, as Matt mentioned earlier, we are working with the customers to share the increased cost. And the way we're looking at it is our first priority is to really meet customer demand, especially with the increased demand for our product. As far as the gross margin, we are very pleased with our Q4 performance and the Q1 guide. And the Q1 guide, if you look at it, it's primarily driven by mix and we'll continue to improve our gross margin to our target level. We discussed during our Investor Day, which is 65%. I think the pace of that improvement is probably different in today's supply-constrained environment versus a normal environment because we do want to make sure we meet customers' demand, increase the demand on this current supply-constraint situation. So the pace will be a little bit different, not as we expected during our last Investor Day. And overall, to just add to what Matt said, overall, we continue to have a similar delinquency, right? So it's certainly supply chain constraint. Yes, it's our OpEx year-over-year, you can think about, it's around 3%, the typical inflation year-over-year. We are managing our resource allocation to ensure we continue to invest in all the growth platforms we have. So that's how you can model it. Yes, Ross, on the other question, just a reminder, other is largely for our printer business today. And quarter-over-quarter, it's actually going to be just up a couple of million dollars sequentially. Yes. On OpEx, right, our team has done excellent job to manage operating expense. But you're right, there are some variabilities quarter-over-quarter due to the project cost and also we are working with our customer together, sometimes the customer portion of it may accelerate or push out. So there are variations, but I feel quite comfortable. Look at the overall for fiscal '22, we can manage the OpEx at the same time investing. So for instance, our Q4, our OpEx is slightly higher because of project cost, but we'll manage it overall. \n On the margin side, I think our #1 objective is really to meet the demand. We have significant opportunities for the company, and we have increased the demand across all the growth platforms, as Matt mentioned, the 5G, cloud and also automotive. So that's actually our #1 objective, and we certainly will continue to improve gross margin and make sure we get the most margin dollars out of our business."

            "name": "Matthew Murphy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a recap of Marvell's highlights for fiscal year 2021. Our GAAP revenue was $2.97 billion, GAAP gross margin was 50.1% and GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.41. On a non-GAAP basis, our gross margin was 63.3% and non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.92. Our consolidated revenue grew 10% year-on-year, led by our networking business, which grew 22% year-on-year. Revenue growth, combined with strong operating leverage from our business model, enabled non-GAAP EPS to grow 39% year-on-year. I am very pleased with our outstanding performance during what has been an otherwise challenging year.  \n Our growth initiatives in 5G, cloud and automotive drove results in these key end markets, which collectively more than doubled in revenue from the prior year to represent more than 25% of fiscal year 2021 revenue. We are really pleased with the performance of Avera and Aquantia, who both delivered revenue above our expectations. We successfully completed the integration of both businesses and overachieved on our synergy targets. \n We also made great strides with our technology platform, announcing the jump to 5-nanometer and along with it, the industry's first 112 gig SerDes for cloud data center infrastructure. This move was a direct result of our multiyear strategic shift to focus on data infrastructure and brings our process node cadence to the cutting edge. The power of our 5-nanometer platform and the benefits it provides for customers is evident in our opportunity funnel, which has grown significantly since we adopted this new node. The activity level on 5-nanometer continues to accelerate, and we have already secured multiple leading edge design wins, each meaningful from a revenue perspective.  \n Our advanced technology is also a key enabler of our custom ASIC offering, which has continued to gain momentum, particularly in cloud. Following on from the design win we announced last quarter, activity levels continue to increase, and we are now involved in advanced discussions with multiple hyperscale data center customers. Our ability to offer customization, coupled with Marvell's leading standard product IP, has proven to be highly compelling to cloud customers.  \n Given its strategic importance, let me provide some more detail on the evolution of the custom ASIC model, bringing to light some of the key trends that make the opportunity so compelling. Traditionally, the primary customer base for custom ASICs has been large system OEMs whose core business is developing hardware to sell as a product. These customers design their own system hardware and build unique technology into the hardware itself through custom chip development to differentiate their products. We do much of the chip design directly and work with a semiconductor partner to license IP and manage the physical layout in front and back-end manufacturing.  \n Today, in addition to these system customers, hyperscale data center operators are also designing their own silicon. And I'm often asked if this trend is good or bad for Marvell. We believe this trend is very good for us as we believe we are ideally positioned to help them solve their unique challenges. Their core business is the cloud service they provide, not the hardware itself. They are building custom hardware because they need incredibly efficient and optimized infrastructure. As a result, they are looking for a semiconductor collaboration that goes well beyond the traditional custom ASIC model and allows them to leverage IP that the silicon partner already has available.  \n The design is typically done in true partnership, with the customer focusing on the portions proprietary to their use cases and Marvell bringing our own unique compute, security, networking and storage IP to the table. Therefore, the end solution is a semi-custom design, which represents the best of both worlds and provides a faster time to market. Because these engagements use our IP, we believe this leads to a more strategic and valuable relationship with these key customers.  \n In addition, compute is becoming increasingly important in this market as hyperscalers are looking to move beyond standard x86 servers and integrate custom ARM-based compute solutions into their architecture. As this trend accelerates, Marvell should be an even more important partner. Our long history in successfully developing and delivering multiple generations of highly complex, multi-core ARM-based processors, including server processors, is unique in the industry.  \n Marvell is emerging as an ideal partner for these customers, and our recent cloud engagements involve deep engineering collaboration on all key aspects of design, including chip architecture, memory density, high-speed SerDes integration, advanced packaging, power optimization and flexible processor implementation.  \n Now let me move on to our quarterly results and expectations. Revenue for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 was $798 million, $13 million above the midpoint of guidance, growing 6% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi, year-on-year revenue growth was even greater at 15%. Our GAAP income per diluted share was $0.02. Our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.29, growing 16% sequentially and 71% year-over-year.  \n As expected, supply constraints limited our ability to fully meet the growing demand for our networking products. We also saw strong demand for our storage products, which drove the upside in revenue relative to the midpoint of our guidance. Although these industry-wide supply shortages are now well known, I expect that they may still be a topic of particular interest during our Q&A session. So in anticipation of your questions, let me provide as much detail as I can for you now.  \n As you are aware, despite or perhaps more accurately due to the impact from COVID-19, demand has grown significantly across a range of semiconductor end markets as data infrastructure has become even more critical to the world's economy. However, the supply chain was not completely prepared for the surge in demand and needs time to increase capacity. While we are confident that the industry will respond to these challenges, we anticipate a supply gap for at least through fiscal 2022.  \n Lead times have extended across the board. We are seeing shortages for multilayer complex substrates, IC packaging capacity and fab constraints in certain technology nodes important for our products. From our vantage point, the increase in demand we are experiencing for our 5G, cloud and auto products appears closely tied to the long-term secular growth drivers present in these end markets. This, combined with the sole source nature of most of our design wins, would suggest that most of the demand we are not able to satisfy in the near-term is not perishable. \n Marvell is collaborating even more closely with our customers to manage demand forecast over an extended time horizon, and our operations team is continuing to drive our suppliers to match supply appropriately to mitigate impacts and minimize disruptions. In addition, we are taking extraordinary measures, including securing capacity in advance over much longer than typical time periods. And we are working with customers to get their assistance in helping absorb some of the incremental costs associated with prioritizing their continuity of supply.  \n Let's now discuss our 2 businesses in more detail. First, in our networking business, revenue during the fourth quarter was $439 million, consistent with our outlook of being flattish to the prior quarter. Year-on-year growth remained robust, with revenue growing 24% compared to the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi. The year-on-year growth in networking was led by our 5G and cloud businesses. In addition, revenue from our Ethernet switch and PHY portfolio grew significantly as new design wins started to ramp.  \n Let me provide some color on sequential revenue movements in networking. In 5G, we delivered our sixth straight quarter of sequential revenue growth. This growth was driven by standard and semi-custom product shipments to Samsung and Nokia, partially offset by a decline in 5G ASICs as deployments in China take a pause. Looking past the typical lumpy nature of individual regional rollouts, 5G infrastructure deployments are expected to continue to strengthen worldwide.  \n As an example, the U.S. recently concluded the first phase of the C-band spectrum auction. This was the highest grossing spectrum auction ever held in the U.S. with gross proceeds exceeding $80 billion. A record level of interest is a clear indicator of the potential revenue opportunities carriers expect from 5G technology. Other regions around the world are also opening up spectrum for 5G services and wireless industry experts expect deployments to gather strength later this year.  \n We launched our open RAN platform in December 2020 and are gaining traction in the marketplace. For example, we recently announced that we are joining the Evenstar program, and we'll be working with Facebook connectivity to provide a 5G open RAN distributed unit design. This design will be based on our leading OCTEON Fusion baseband processors and ARM-based OCTEON multi-core DPUs. Evenstar DU design will enable a new generation of RAN suppliers to deliver high-performance, cost-optimized, interoperable DU products to the rapidly expanding open RAN ecosystem.  \n We recently announced that Fujitsu will be using our industry-leading OCTEON Fusion baseband processors in its new 5G base stations and also plan to engage with us on open RAN distributed unit products. They are the second 5G regional customer I referenced last quarter.  \n In cloud networking, we benefited from strong customer demand in the fourth quarter for our smartNIC DPUs, while the cloud ASIC declined as expected. Looking forward, we expect to continue benefiting from the secular growth in cloud CapEx on semiconductor solutions for data processing.  \n Turning to our automotive business. Quarterly revenues crossed into the double-digit million run rate, driven by the ramp of multiple Ethernet design wins in model year 2021 vehicles. Engagements are expanding at additional large OEMs and bookings have continued to strengthen. We believe that fiscal 2022 is shaping up to be a breakout year for this business.\n The fourth quarter was robust for our Ethernet switch and PHY business with product ramps at multiple customers. The design wins we won over the last couple of years are now starting to ramp, and we expect these will contribute higher levels of revenue as we progress into fiscal 2022.  \n Let me now discuss the outlook for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 for our networking business. Reflecting strong demand, despite continued supply constraints, we project revenues to grow close to 10% on a sequential basis and continued strong year-on-year growth exceeding 20%. We expect this growth to be broad-based, led by our cloud DPUs, standard and semi-custom 5G solutions, automotive products and Ethernet networking solutions, partially offset by softness in 5G ASICs.  \n Turning now to our storage business. Storage revenue for the fourth quarter was better than expected across all product lines, growing 18% sequentially to $326 million. This was a very strong quarter for our storage business with 10% year-on-year growth, driven by our custom SSD controller and cloud HDD products. I'm very pleased with the tremendous progress we have made over the last few years in enabling high-capacity nearline HDDs, which are critical for cloud customers. We have extended our long-standing relationship with Toshiba, and we recently announced that our controllers and preamps are powering their new 18-terabyte cloud scale HDDs.  \n Toshiba's 18-terabyte products deliver industry-leading data storage capacity by utilizing MAMR technology and advanced signal processing developed in close partnership with Marvell. The close coupling of Marvell's rechannel and preamplifier IP enables leading edge features and HDD capacity to extend Toshiba's position in the cloud data center market. \n Let me now provide some additional color on storage revenue on a sequential basis. In the fourth quarter, our custom SSD controller revenue benefited from the ongoing ramp at a Tier 1 OEM as well as the initial ramp at a major cloud customer. In HDDs, demand was strong across multiple end markets, including enterprise, smart video, retail and client, and our business benefited from aggregate HDD unit TAM growth of about 10% sequentially. Our revenue from cloud HDDs also grew on strong customer demand for our products.  \n In our fiber channel business, demand recovered significantly from the COVID-19 impacts earlier in the year. Our operations team was able to increase supply to help our OEMs restock and deliver more product to their customers.  \n Looking to the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we project a seasonal decline in storage controller demand. In addition, after last quarter's inventory replenishment by customers, we expect a more than seasonal decline in fiber channel demand. As a result, after a very strong fourth quarter, we expect our storage revenue to decline in the low teens sequentially on a percentage basis. However, we expect a continued year-on-year growth of over 10% in the first quarter.  \n In closing, needless to say, last year was a very challenging period as we adjusted to operating in the presence of a pandemic. It was almost exactly a year ago today when shelter-in-place policies were coming into effect and we're in the midst of taking action to protect our 5,000-plus employees and an extended support team of contractors and suppliers. None of us really knew how the year would evolve or how the pandemic would impact our productivity or the demand for our products and technology. I can now look back and applaud a strong performance by the Marvell team in the face of adversity: incredible program execution, record design win achievement, stronger customer relationships, double-digit revenue growth and significant margin expansion. I'm very proud of our employees, and I would like to thank them for their collective efforts in positioning Marvell to emerge even stronger from the pandemic.  \n We ended fiscal 2021 on a strong note, and we are kicking off fiscal 2022 with solid growth expectations, guiding revenue at the midpoint for the first quarter to grow 15% year-on-year despite ongoing supply challenges. We expect strong year-on-year growth from both our networking and storage businesses in the first quarter. Non-GAAP EPS at the midpoint for the first quarter is now -- is projected to grow by 50% year-on-year, demonstrating the operating leverage in our business model.  \n In fiscal 2022, we expect revenue growth from custom SSD controllers, preamplifiers, automotive Ethernet and enterprise networking, in addition to our expanding 5G and cloud businesses, which is still early in their growth cycles. Our team is also focused on closing key design wins from the large funnel of 5-nanometer and cloud engagements I discussed earlier. \n We are getting closer to completing the Inphi transaction and as part of integration planning, we recently concluded a series of joint strategic planning sessions. The conclusion of these meetings, our teams walked away more excited than ever about the depth of technology and the level of talent across the combined company. The addition of Inphi broadens the opportunity set for the combined company, and this will be a key factor in setting future investment priorities. As a reminder, the closing of the Inphi transaction remains subject to obtaining shareholder and regulatory approvals and satisfying other closing conditions. \n With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Sure. Thanks, Harlan. Yes. No, I think you highlighted some of the growth drivers. So just a few comments. I think the first is we are -- we have been planning for growth in our FY '22. I think we're off to a good start for the year. If you look at our Q1 guidance alone, it's going to be up 15% year-over-year versus a year ago. \n We've got some very strong secular growth drivers. You mentioned 5G, and there's certainly some positive signs, especially for the second half there. We have our cloud business, which is also growing on a secular basis as well as our new product ramps. And actually, we also have automotive, which is really off to a good start this year, and we see that continuing. So we've got that as a tailwind behind us. \n I'd say we've been able to drive growth, even if you look at FY '21, pretty consistently. We've been growing each quarter, quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Q4, we were able to actually exceed guidance and make up -- service some of the demand that was there. So that was a positive side. \n I think -- so I think the message is we've been delivering well. There's been a new sort of increased surge, and that's really where we're focused is working with our supply chain partners to be able to capture that upside above and beyond the growth rate that we've already been achieving. So bottom line answer to your question is I'm very confident that we can grow revenue in the second half based on the capacity that we've secured and worked hard with our supply chain partners to put in place. And we're also going to look to see if there's upside opportunity to pursue that as well. \n And that's not only for this year, but as I look even into our FY '23, we're starting to work with our supply chain partners there as well to really give them advanced notice because we see those trends like 5G, cloud and automotive being even stronger in the out years with new products ramping, new customers coming online, and we're pretty excited about our future there. So yes, I think we'll be in -- we're working hard on the -- on all fronts. Sure. Yes. I think, Vivek, it's a couple of things. I think, first, it has a lot to do with the end markets that we're in. I mean, fundamentally, remember, we're one of the only pure-play infrastructure companies. So we don't have consumer demand that's sort of very volatile, maybe good 1 quarter, maybe not so good in 2 quarters. We don't have a lot of demand that sort of comes and goes. We tend to -- and this is sort of by design, by the way, the business model that we've put together is to bring together these various end applications and drive consistent and ideally predictable growth. So while we may not be as flashy in some quarters as certain companies that really have some explosive demand, but then maybe it abates later, we're focused on slow and steady wins today and continuing to execute and grow our company quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. \n Certainly, there's opportunities out there to secure some upside, and we're working on that. But I think even if you saw in Q4, for us, we were quite pleased with the overachievement on revenue, and we're very comfortable with the first quarter guide as well. So I think it's more around we've been one of the faster growers in the last few quarters and also our end-market dynamics. Ideally, we'll deliver more repeatable and sustainable long-term growth with maybe less quarter-to-quarter variation. That's been the strategy. In terms of the demand or the supply? Sure. Yes. Well, I think a couple of things are going on. If you -- as I indicated in my comments earlier with Harlan, we certainly have -- 5G in the second half will continue to accelerate. We have -- there are new geographies coming online. We believe that the U.S. will -- shows very good prospects for the second half. We believe that China as well will go through their digestion phase, and then you have Japan and you have new countries, even India is talking about potentially pulling in their spectrum auction. So that's all positive. So we expect that to continue. \n Our cloud business continues to grow, and we see that continuing, both on a secular basis as well as new products, including our ASIC storage and our DPUs, which are doing quite well in terms of smartNICs. Automotive, the same thing. We've got a good ramp going with our calendar -- our model year, sorry, '21 ramps. We've got more to come in model year '22 with additional OEMs coming online as well as expanded content. And even some of the new automotive, I call it, the new breed of automotive OEMs, the EV-only focused companies, really aggressively adopting our solutions. So we're positive there.  \n And then we've got custom SSD controllers, both for cloud as well as for our system OEM. And finally, on top of that, our enterprise business has done extremely well if you look at -- which was surprising, but if you look at even our results in last year, that business with our switch and PHY products grew significantly, primarily on our own product cycle, and we also are very optimistic about that as well. So there's a number of good things that are happening in our business, Vivek, both from an end market as well as a product cycle standpoint. And so as Harlan pointed out, we've got to go, just continue to make sure we've got the right supply profile to meet that, but we're working hard on that. Sure. Maybe, Jean, I'll have you answer the first part on storage. And then, Tim, I'll have you repeat your question, you broke up a little bit on the second part of it. But Jean, why don't you go ahead and give us some comments around storage? Yes. I think we'll -- I think, Tim, so first of all, I think we're -- we have a -- I don't even know what the new normal is in storage anywhere -- anymore, but there certainly is a seasonality effect to that, but we're not really guiding out that far at this point. What I want to emphasize, though, is that even on the sort of lumpiness of fiber channel, which has definitely started, I think, with the shelter-in-place orders that went into effect earlier in 2020, there's just been a -- it's been a lumpier business than normal, and so it had a very good Q4. And then, obviously, we've guided it down for Q1. \n But if you just sort of step back, storage overall for Marvell is up 10% year-over-year in Q1 is what we're guiding. So -- despite some of the lumpiness. And this is a higher sort of beta business than the rest of our businesses. We're still pretty pleased with the trajectory of this business. And we do expect the fiber channel portion to normalize throughout this year, assuming that there's no more supply chain surprises. Yes. No, I think as we've said, the supply impacts we've seen have been more pronounced in the networking business. So that has limited our ability to deliver upside, like we want to. Even then, you got to remember, too, our -- the compare is a little bit tough because we did have a very strong Q3. I mean, you've got to now go back to sort of what are you comparing it to. If you remember, Q3 was up very significantly from our Q2. And then year-over-year, it was up a ton. So the flat compare, while we wish we could have done a little better, it's still, on an annual basis, still growing really well. \n I wouldn't really break out that there was sort of weakness in one or the other. I think we're coming off a big Q3 and then also the 5G was up and enterprise has continued to be up, and we've actually seen, from a year ago, everything growing. So I think it's more of a sequential issue. And certainly, we're pleased with the Q1, 10% up, and that business continues to do very well for us. Well, yes, on the second part, you're right, other than 5G ASICs, which were mostly tied to the China deployments in 5G, which were extremely strong in calendar '20. And we're seeing that digestion now. Yes, the rest of it is up, but there's not necessarily a catch-up per se, in Q1. I mean, we are seeing demand increase. And I think we've -- we see revenue going up and we see -- so I'd say it's more demand-driven than just, oh, well, we've caught up and now the demand is flat. We actually have a pretty robust demand picture for that particular business, both year-on-year and sequentially. Yes. C.J., I'll take your other question. So I think the -- if you even go back to our purchase of Avera, there was really 2 -- we had a thesis there on 2 fronts. One was to be more relevant in the 5G market and be able to offer full custom design capability along with the semi-custom that we had developed with our lead customer. And as you've seen, that's gone really well. The second was that the recognition that in the cloud hyperscale market that more and more of the -- particularly compute-based solutions, were going to go to full custom or even semi-custom, but a need to really have a full ASIC capability. \n And these are -- there's a range of applications, by the way. These things could be anything from AI or ML chips to server-class CPUs to networking products, smartNICs, so there's a variety of applications. And as I said in my prepared remarks, this trend is here to stay, and we think it's good for us. I think there is a world that, that's post x86 or certainly coexist with it where more and more of the compute and more and more of these solutions are moving to very, very customized products. And we have all the ideal pieces to support that in terms of our process technology, our in-house IPs, like our SerDes, both for short reach and medium and long-reach at the highest frequencies, including 112 gig. And our ability to really partner closely and deeply and be flexible in our business model as well. \n And what I mean by that is we can do standard ASICs that are the traditional model you think of. But increasingly, what I'm seeing is the engagements with the cloud companies are really more partnership-oriented where it's solutioning together and it's proposing architectures and proposing 4 different ways to do something and then coming up with a model that really suits their needs. And so I think sort of our go-to-market plus our technology road map and then having all these key pieces, whether it's networking IP, very, very strong compute portfolio with all of our history from the Cavium side and ARM-based processors to security, to storage. And then within PHY coming in, obviously, the optical connectivity. So I think we're going to -- we can be an ideal partner here, and we think this is going to be a very big opportunity, and it's going to be one that's here to stay. Sure. Why don't I take the 5G question, then Jean, you can comment on other. So yes, Ross, I think you're right. I mean, we've we performed really well on the cycle. We had 6 quarters of sequential revenue growth in 5G, and we were able to power through as new products ramped. And new customers came online when some others maybe felt different paces of digestion. So I think we're pleased with that outperformance in that run. \n The China, in particular, deployments last year were very large. And so as you pointed out, I think a number of companies are going through a similar digestion, but we do expect this business to accelerate and continue to outperform for a couple of reasons. I think one is our lead customer has certainly gained momentum in some of the markets that we'll be ramping in the second half plus in calendar '22. So that's a positive sign. And there's also -- within them, there's programs where we have new sockets where content is also -- it's new content for us. \n And then we have our second customer, Nokia, which this year will be our first full year -- not even a full year. It's ramping this year into production with our baseband product. It will be a full year in '22. And then we have additional content with that customer, which was all publicly announced last year that will start to phase in after that. \n So I think there's -- yes, there's a number of Marvell -- very specific Marvell drivers with some of the most important companies in this space. And then even looking beyond that horizon, we've got really good traction with our ORAN initiatives. And we're in the mix on a number of very important sockets across all the OEMs that will keep driving growth here. So we feel very good about our 5G position that it can continue to outperform and accelerate going forward. Yes. So yes, let me give you a little background on what we did, how we're thinking about it and maybe some broad brush strokes on the opportunities. Certainly, we're not -- we're still 2 separate companies. So I think more to come on that, Tore. And some of the opportunities as well, some are pronounced and some are nuanced, but the bottom line is first of all, Ford and Lloyd, the founder of N5, put together just an incredible team. I mean we've now gotten exposure through this process, which was great. Their key engineering leadership, their key product marketing people, their business unit leaders and also same on our side. So it was really a very, very powerful, I'd say, joint meeting where we reviewed all of our various businesses, and we were able to identify a number of exciting areas where we certainly can work together. \n In general, the technology is obviously very complementary, but we do sit in the same systems. And certainly, there's things like process road map and customers where we can go in together. So I'd say the net -- and the way we -- the reason we did this is we're really approaching this as a merger with the Inphi team. And so we're going to bring them in, and we're going to look at really the combined company spending and identify jointly the best opportunities to get the highest ROI and drive the best top line growth. \n And so what we found is we believe this is going to give us an opportunity to allocate some additional spending in some very targeted areas within the Inphi team to actually accelerate some of their ambitions and growth. And I can tell you from our side and my entire management team, multiple layers down, is very excited about the team coming over and their product lines and their prospects. And I look forward in future meetings to actually start articulating some of these in a lot more detail. But I'd just end it by saying thematically, combined, I think we've become much more important and much more relevant in the cloud hyperscale market than either company would have been independently. \n And I think, together, given the system-level complexity that these companies are dealing with, the cutting-edge performance they need, the deep sort of real technical and strategic partnerships they're looking for, we believe that this can be as important and strategic a market and probably larger market combined than 5G. And so I think we're -- our strategy we laid out at the Investor Day, which was a little bit before Inphi, but certainly was on our mind, which was really think about 5G as this wave of growth that we're seeing right now, the cloud then following that. And certainly, Inphi layering in will accelerate our opportunity there. And then we have a lot more to share at a later date as well on our automotive opportunities, which is starting with Ethernet, but it's now branching out into other aspects of Marvell, including storage and security, compute, ASICs, and some other additional networking type of solutions. So all in all, I think the combined company is going to be very, very relevant in this cloud market, especially. Yes. I think -- let me give you the backdrop. So I think the exciting part of our ASIC opportunity, and I would even broaden that to say our broader, I'd call it, advanced technology opportunity, of which ASIC is certainly an important piece. This would be what I would call our 5 -- just think about our 5-nanometer platform as its own potential growth opportunity. We publicly announced this in August of 2020, but we have been securing designs in this technology as early as end of 2019 type of time frame, early 2020. And so since that time frame, we've grown this design opportunity funnel to be very significant size relative to anything we've seen before on a single sort of process node. \n And it's very broad, Chris. I think that's sort of the point I want to make. I think there are -- if you go by market, certainly, there are 5G designs that we've already won and secured as an example there, and there's a large pipeline in front of us as people move from sort of 12-, 14-, 16-nanometer type of products, and they want to go all the way down. There are significant cloud hyperscale opportunities. Some of those I mentioned earlier. But also in enterprise, we've had good success in promoting our OCTEON-based CPUs into that market. That would be more of a standard product, by the way, not a custom. \n And then even in storage, we've seen some very important customers in the storage market take a leadership role and work directly with us to develop state-of-the-art flash controllers for things like data center and enterprise applications using our 5-nanometer technology. So it's -- this is much broader, Chris, than just, oh, well, Marvell has got a 5-nanometer thing and they can go offer ASICs with a standard sort of model, and that will generate some revenue. It's really a transformational platform for us, which we're -- we could use for traditional ASICs. But increasingly, we're finding that these custom opportunities that people come and ask us for, several of them have now converted into Marvell products where we're designing the entire product based on a spec. And designing the product for them rather than -- and then, of course, there's more value that can be captured there. It's a more stickier engagement. And these are all very significant type of opportunities, in particular, in the cloud market. \n So I hope that's helpful context to sort of broaden it because certainly, we had a view maybe going back to when we bought Avera. Hey, this will be great. We can have a nice big ASIC business, but it's turned into much more than that. And yes, and we're excited to talk about that in the coming quarters as we close designs and we take advantage of the pipeline that our sales team and our business units have developed, which is extremely strong. That's hard to say. And I think it depends on what you mean, like is it -- how much is ASIC versus how much is semi-custom versus how much is in 5G, but this is clearly a -- this is the future growth of the company. So you should assume these things are multibillion type of opportunities for the whole platform going forward, right? I mean, this is where we're going to be the growth engine of the company. So it's very significant. These are not nichey one-off designs that we're winning that will kind of be a nice sort of headline news product, this is going to be really the driver of the company's revenue growth. So in aggregate, all of this becomes a very significant portion of our future company revenue. Yes. I think on the first question, Joe, it's hard to say. I mean this is such a dynamic environment, right? We've been reviewing every part of the supply chain as a team for months, right? And we're finding that we solve one issue and then another one seems to appear. And if you even go back to our last earnings call, I remember there were some questions there like, tell me about the supply chain issue and you fast forward 3 months and the U.S. automotive industry is in disarray because they can't get chips, right? So things are moving at a very rapid pace. \n I will note that we're supplying quite well actually on our automotive products, so don't make that comment with Marvell. That's more of a general one. But we do see point capacity stress with complex substrates, for sure. We see some of the \"older nodes\" and what I would mean by that is this isn't sort of 5-, 7-nanometer type of things. These are more going back to, call it, 28- and above, right, that have different pain points that companies are working with. And that's where a lot of this automotive, I think, tends to sit. \n So it's -- there's not a silver bullet. It's just going to take a lot of hard work. And even things like -- I think I noted in the last call, things like wire bonders have -- those lead times have stretched. So our OSATs are just having a hard time keeping up. \n Now they're spending money, and they're certainly adding capacity, and we're engaged in that planning process to make sure we're okay, but that's maybe a little bit more detail on that side. And then what was your second question? Oh, on the networking chips, yes. Yes. It's hard for me to benchmark since we're not in the graphics business. I know that's a little bit of a different scale. But certainly, the complexity level of these products when you look at just the complexity of the substrates alone, I mean, I think the number of layers, if you go to these advanced products in, call it, 14-, 16-nanometer and below, have probably doubled in terms of the complexity of the substrates. And they're just extremely large die. These are thousands of IOs and some of these die are virtually the size of a credit card. So you've just got very low die per wafer, and you got a lot of demand. And it's been difficult for people to keep up. \n There's also test constraints that the test times on these things are very long because of the complexity of the product. So there's just -- maybe that's the reason. But I run an analog business and now I run Marvell, but I've never run a graphics business. I don't... [indiscernible] about that. Yes."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Ashish Saran, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell\u2019s President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO. I would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our website in the Investor Relations section. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance.\nMatt Murphy: Great. Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. The third quarter was an exciting and exceptionally busy time for the Marvell team, as we hosted our 2020 Investor Day, and soon after announced plans for our transformational acquisition of Inphi. These were both significant events which continued to generate strong interest from the financial community. So before I discuss our quarterly results, let me summarize the growth strategy we articulated at our Investor Day, and the benefits we expect to drive from the combination with Inphi. During our Virtual Investor Day, we discussed the importance of choosing the right end market, building a larger base of key customers, and driving technology platform leadership aligned with the most exciting growth drivers in the industry. We discussed our focus on the data infrastructure market, a $110 billion total semiconductor opportunity for Marvell, of which we are currently servicing $16 billion, and that we expect to grow 50% faster than the TAM over the next few years. We showcased the expansion we expect to drive in our base of Tier 1 $100 million plus customers to a total of 13 over the next couple of years. We outlined the evolution of our technology roadmap to being first to market with the 5-nanometer platform for portfolio wide leadership. We concluded with our compelling long-term growth vision focused on 5G, cloud, and automotive end markets. At the event, we also disclosed the number of new design wins, which we believe will contribute meaningfully towards revenue growth over the next several years. In 5G, we announced the second customer for OCTEON and the radio head, as well as two additional base station customers for Ethernet products. In the enterprise market, we announced a broader footprint for our Ethernet switches and PHYs at two Tier 1 North American networking OEMs. One of these OEMs also selected our next generation 5-nanometer OCTEON processors to replace their current x86 Solutions across their entire enterprise router platforms. In our storage business, we won a cloud datacenter, DIY SSD controller and announced a new Tier 1 NAND OEM for our merchant SSD controllers. Consistent with the strategy we discussed at Investor Day, on October 29, we announced our plans to combine with Inphi in a highly complementary and strategic transaction and expected to accelerate our growth and leadership in the fast-growing cloud and 5G markets. We discussed multiple benefits expected to result from this merger, including a larger and faster growing addressable market, a broadening of our Tier 1 cloud customer base, greater scale for our 5- and 3-nanometer platforms, an exceptionally talented SerDes team, and an even stronger long-term financial model. We also discussed significant opportunities for cross selling, which would represent upside to the target operating model. Since the announcement, we have been able to discuss the benefits of this merger with employees, customers, partners, and shareholders of both companies. These discussions have further strengthened our conviction in all the key strategic elements of this exciting transaction. We've had the opportunity to meet with a broader cross section of Inphi employees and continue to be highly impressed with their depth of technical capability, focus on innovation, and seamless program execution. The Marvell and Inphi teams are well aligned from a cultural perspective with many shared values and core beliefs. Similar to the approach we've taken in our prior acquisitions, we are looking forward to integrating Inphi employees across all levels of the combined company. I can already sense that the sales, product management, and engineering teams on both sides are chomping at the bit so they can start driving new revenue growth opportunities. Let's dig a little deeper into these opportunities, which we expect will result from the strong positions established by Marvell in 5G and Inphi and cloud. We believe that having a leading product at the heart of the customer's architecture is critical as it sets the cadence of technology adoption and pulls along additional products into the full solution. We saw this play out effectively following the Cavium acquisition, and you are all now familiar with the significant increase in content and customer expansion we were able to drive in 5G, as a combined company. In base stations, the front, mid, and backhaul connectivity is primarily optical. And with the emergence of 5G, the speed and bandwidth of these links needs to increase substantially. Inphi\u2019s high performance PAM4 and coherent DSP-based electro-optics solutions are perfectly aligned to deliver these higher speeds. We believe that Marvell's leadership in embedded processors for 5G infrastructure will better position Inphi to participate in the optical conductivity opportunity. In cloud, Inphi\u2019s electro optics platform is critical to data center architecture, and they have established direct relationships with the industry's largest cloud infrastructure providers. Inphi's recent results and guidance illustrate the benefits of having a strong presence in the cloud market. For their third quarter of fiscal 2020, they reported revenue growth of 92% year over year, and the organic portion of their business grew 57% year over year. We're excited to see that they expect growth to continue in the fourth quarter with Inphi revenue guided to grow 82% year-over-year at the midpoint. Marvell also has a growing presence in the cloud market, and merging with Inphi is expected to create multiple $100 million plus cloud customers for the combined company. We expect to drive numerous revenue growth opportunities for ASICs and DPUs with these large cloud customers. Within cloud data centers, we expect compute for AI and other use cases to increasingly require tailored solutions, resulting in an expansion of custom and ASIC opportunities for the combined company. In cloud, custom compute engines in ASICs are often connected directly to external optics, such as in a machine learning cluster. This presents a unique opportunity for the combined company to tightly integrate optics inside ASICs and custom compute processors through onboard and co-packaged optics solutions. Cloud customers are particularly excited about this capability. In addition to the ASIC opportunities I just discussed, we expect similar benefits to Marvell's cloud DPU business. Today, Marvell's DPUs or SmartNICs is standard product to cloud customers. In the short-term, we see a greater opportunity to win more business for our existing products. In the longer-term, we can provide higher value DPU solutions with tightly integrated onboard and co-package optics. Since announcing the deal, we have completed a number of initial meetings with key customers. While any detailed joint roadmap discussions will need to wait until receipt of all regulatory approvals, customer reactions from the meeting so far have been extremely positive, and they have already identified multiple new opportunities for Marvell. In fact, I've been personally involved in a number of these discussions, and I am now even more confident in the potential for new revenue growth opportunities. Let me move on now to our quarterly results and expectations. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was $750 million, growing 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Stronger than expected revenue growth from our networking business offset weaker than anticipated results from storage. Our GAAP loss per share was $0.03, our non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.25, growing 19% sequentially and 47% year-over-year. I'm pleased with the growth in revenue and earnings we have been able to drive in the third quarter. We are projecting strong growth in the fourth quarter as demand from customers continues to increase. Our operations team is continuing to ramp production with our global supply chain partners. However, we have begun to experience a number of industry wide supply constraints affecting the type of high complexity products we provide for data infrastructure. The rapid recovery this year in the semiconductor industry appears to be stressing significant portions of the supply chain. These supply challenges are currently limiting our ability to fully satisfy, the increase in demand for some of our networking products. Let's now discuss our two businesses in more detail. First in our networking business, revenue during the quarter was $445 million and grew 10% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. Revenue growth was stronger than our expectations of mid to high-single-digit sequential growth and overall this was a very strong quarter across a broad base of our products and end markets including 5G, cloud, automotive and enterprise. In 5G, we delivered our fifth straight quarter of sequential revenue growth. In the first-half of this year, 5G growth was driven primarily from our ASIC business benefiting from the rapid deployments in China. In the third quarter, while the wireless infrastructure ASIC business remains strong, the sequential growth was driven primarily by standard and semi-custom product shipments to Samsung. The rollout of 5G outside of China is starting to pick up, and we expect consumer demand for 5G services will continue to grow worldwide, following the launch of new 5G phones from Apple. As we look forward, we expect 5G momentum to accelerate through next year in multiple regions including the U.S. and Japan. Our 5G customer base continues to expand and the second regional customer has selected Marvell's industry leading OCTEON fusion-based NAND processors to power their new 5G base stations. They plan to engage with Marvell on a variety of RAN architectures, including emerging ORAN initiatives, enabling them to flexibly address the needs of network operators regardless of the network topology being deployed. Let me take a moment to preview Marvell's efforts in the emerging, Open RAN, and virtualized RAN architectures. These are commonly referred to as ORAN and VRAN respectively. Global operators are driving toward open standards-based interfaces with the RAN to enable multi-vendor interoperability. In addition, the use of virtualization to separate hardware and software has begun making its way into the radio access network. Now, whether virtual or physical, the complexity of 5G processing, real time latency requirements, and the tight power envelope necessitate optimized hardware acceleration to be deployed at scale. We addressed this need with our OCTEON fusion processors, the industry's leading silicon platform for 5G-based band and radio processing. We're adding more capabilities to this proven technology to further optimize it for open virtual environments. We will soon unveil details of our new VRAN accelerator, which is based on OCTEON fusion, designed to support an open and interoperable ecosystem with a full set of ORAN standards-based interfaces. By adding ORAN and VRAN capabilities to our existing 5G offerings, Marvell will be the ideal semiconductor partner with a complete 5G platform capable of supporting all RAN architectures on common hardware and software framework. This is a critical differentiator for Marvell given that beyond a few Greenfield deployments, most 5G networks will have a complex hybrid architecture to support a diverse set of deployment scenarios. I look forward to discussing the continued evolution of our 5G platform. Moving on to our ASIC business, we've benefited from a strong ramp in a new cloud program and we are excited about this opportunity. I would note that similar to other cloud programs, we expect purchasing patterns for the new ASIC to be somewhat lumpy with demand fluctuations in any given quarter. We recently announced our 112 gig 5-nanometers SerDes solution that has been fully validated in hardware and is ready for adoption by customers. We believe that this technology with industry leading performance, power is an area will help drive 100 gig as the interconnect of choice for next generation data infrastructure. Our ASIC business is the first beneficiary of this leading edge IP, and I'm very pleased that we have secured a new custom ASIC design win that will embed our 112 gig SerDes in next generation top of rack and spine switches for leading hyperscale data centers. Turning to our automotive business, industry production appears to be recovering from COVID-19 impacts earlier in the year. We're also seeing record bookings and have started ramping multiple Ethernet design wins in model year 2021 vehicles. These ramps drove strong revenue growth in the third quarter and we expect growth to continue in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2022. In our enterprise end market, we continue to refresh our Ethernet products and recently introduced the second generation of our Octal multi-gig PHY family. These are the newest additions to Marvell's borderless enterprise portfolio, comprehensive set of switches and PHYs architected to address the specific requirements of emerging mobility and cloud applications that are extending the boundaries of the traditional campus environment. The new PHY family offers a clear upgrade path to multi gigabit technology. We believe that an increase in customer interest for our multi-gig products and our recent design win momentum are strong leading indicators that the industry is getting ready for a much broader multi-gig adoption. During the quarter we closed multi-gig PHY design wins with six customers across access points, gateway, switches and firewalls. We are also getting very strong traction with our refresh switches and PHYs with multiple security hardware customers. Now let me discuss the outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter for our networking business. We expect growth from 5G to continue with Samsung and the start of a ramp into Nokia, partially offset by a decline in 5G ASICs, as deployments in China take a pause. We project a strong quarter for our automotive business, with quarterly revenue expected to cross in double-digit millions. We expect enterprise switching to continue to improve as we ramp new products. We also expect growth from our liquid security DPU shipping to cloud customers. Offsetting this growth, we project a sequential decline in revenue from our cloud ASIC. As a result after a very strong third quarter, we expect networking revenue in the fourth quarter to be approximately flat on a sequential basis, and on a year-over-year basis projected to grow approximately 25%, compared to the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are currently supply constrained on some of our networking products. Now turning to our storage business. Storage revenue for the third quarter was $276 million declining 5% sequentially, lower expectations of being flat. During the quarter demand for Fibre Channel products from our enterprise server and storage customers was impacted more heavily than anticipated, although we expect this level of weakness to be temporary. On the other hand, the sequential revenue growth we had expected from our storage controller business did materialize, led by a ramp on our custom SSD controllers. Our cloud HDD business also grew sequentially. At this year's virtual flash memory summit, our storage team had another strong show and alongside HPE, we were named a Best of Show award winner for the Marvell based NVMe RAID boot SSD. HPE is the first of Marvell's partners to support this new accelerator, the product lowers data center total cost of ownership by offloading RAID 1 processing from costly server CPU resources, maximizing application performance. In addition, we demonstrated our latest data center flash controller for building large capacity ultra-low latency, high performance SSDs and our low power 12-nanometre PCIe Gen4 controller for client SSDs. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our storage business to rebound strongly and project sequential revenue growth in the low teens on a percentage basis. We expect this growth to be driven from multiple products. We project a strong recovery in our Fibre Channel business towards a more normalized run rate. We also expect our cloud storage revenue to continue to grow, which includes more meaningful contribution from our preamplifiers. In addition, we are projecting the start of a product ramp of a cloud DIY SSD controller design win, I mentioned in my opening remarks. In closing, our results and guidance continue to progress in the right direction. We are projecting fiscal 2021 fourth quarter revenue at the midpoint of guidance to grow approximately 9% year-over-year and grow 13% year-over-year for the ongoing business as compared to last year's fourth quarter results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi. We continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to alleviate constraints and meet the growing demand from our customers. Through this fiscal year, which has certainly had a share of COVID-19-related challenges, I'm very pleased with the growth we have driven from 5G and cloud, and it is still early days for us in these two critical end markets. In addition, our automotive and preamplifier businesses are now starting to contribute more meaningfully. Our custom SSD controller programs have recently started to ramp and we will benefit from a full year of shipments in fiscal 2022. We also expect that a refreshed Ethernet switch and PHY products will enable us to take share in the enterprise and carrier end markets. From a broader perspective, there has been encouraging news on the vaccine front, which bodes well for a macro economic recovery next year. Overall, the setup for fiscal year 2022 looks very promising. Equally exciting, we are looking forward to combining with Inphi to accelerate our joint vision to lead the ongoing transformation in the fast growing cloud and 5G markets. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nJean Hu: Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue in the third quarter was $750 million. Networking represented 59% of our revenue with the storage contributing 37%, driven by growth in 5G and the cloud and the gravity of revenue contribution from our networking business of nearly 60% reached the new record in the third quarter. Revenue from other accounted for 4% of our revenue declining 5% sequentially and 35% year-on-year. As a reminder this business consists of a product we have stopped to investing in. So we expect they will continue to decline over time. Our guidance for the fourth quarter anticipated sequential growth from other, as we expect some customers to complete last time buys on certain components. GAAP gross margin was 50.8%, non- GAAP gross margin was 63% of revenue consistent with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $390 million, and include the cost for share based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition under divestiture related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $280 million. GAAP operating loss was $9 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $193 million or 25.7% of revenue. For the third quarter GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.03. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.25. Now turning to our balance sheet, during the quarter cash flow from operations was $258 million. In fiscal 2021, we have driven strong free cash flow conversion of 114% of non-GAAP net income on a year-to-date basis. We returned $40 million to shareholders through dividend payments. During the quarter, we paid down $100 million of our term loan and exited the quarter with $832 million in cash and short-term investment and the total debt outstanding of $1.35 billion. We continue to have $500 million of liquidity available from our undrawn revolver. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.6 on a trailing 12 month basis. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to the pending acquisition of Inphi. Before I provide our outlook for the fourth quarter, a remainder on our OpEx patterns. Please note that due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes, our OpEx in the first fiscal quarter tends to increase mid-single digit sequentially on a percentage basis. And this effects then dissipates in the rest of the fiscal year. Here's specific guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. We're forecasting revenue to be in the range of $785 million plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 52.8%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 64%, which anticipates a favorable product mix during the fourth quarter. As we discussed during our Investor Day, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin in the near future to be in the range of 63% to 64%, depending upon the relative mix of a certain 5G and the cloud products in any given quarter. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $379 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $280 million. We expect net interest expense to be approximately $15 million and non-GAAP of tax rate of 5%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be $673 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be $686 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.03 per share on the low end to an income of $0.07 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.25 to $0.33. Please note that our GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using basic weighted average shares outstanding, when there's the a GAAP net loss, and calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding when there's a GAAP net income. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Operator, please open the lines and announce the Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, thank you very much for taking the question. Matt, you talked about supply constraints having some impact on your business in the quarter. Can you help us quantify how big the impact was in the quarter? And what sort of assumptions are embedded in your guide? Then I've got a quick follow-up. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes, as we noted, we have seen a number of constraints, I would say over the last few quarters, by the way in certain process node bottlenecks as well as I think it's fairly widely known there's significant increase in demand this year for complex substrates as well. And so, we've seen this tightness, we're managing through it. The way I would think about it is, we've had a historically a fairly steady level of delinquency that we enter every quarter with delinquency being defined as the amount of product that we had got request dates for in the current quarter in, that we can't supply within the quarter, and that's something that we track on a regular basis. Heading into Q4, that number is significantly larger than we've had. And part of that is customers, due to the constraints out there have also placed longer lead times on us. So, I think we're pleased to be able to guide up sequentially. And certainly, if you look year-over-year, the business is up quite strongly overall especially in our networking business. So, we're happy about that. But I guess what I would say is, you should think about it as we're like many other companies, I think carrying a significantly higher level of delinquency than we have historically.\nToshiya Hari: Got it. Thank you for that. And then as my follow-up on the storage side of the business, the quarter came in a little bit below expectations and you spoke to the decline in the fiber channel business. Going forward, it's good to see that you're guiding the business up low teens in the current quarter. But beyond that, should we assume kind of growth to be in the low-single digit range consistent with what you talked about at your Analyst Day with some of the drivers like, the DIY SSD controller and the preamps or should we expect it to remain pretty lumpy as it relates to storage? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. No, I think the thesis from Investor Day is certainly still intact, and we are pleased to see a nice upswing in the fourth quarter, understanding that Q3 was a little bit weaker, and we did have this somewhat unusual lumpiness in Fibre Channel, which I think as you know, historically has been a relatively stable business. But given some of the impacts earlier this year with supply chain on boards, and some of the COVID-19-related impacts on enterprise, that business did have a lot more volatility to it than we've normally experienced. Offsetting that, obviously, has been very, very strong growth in our traditional Marvell storage controller business, which is by the way the business that normally has been historically a little bit more lumpy, that one's performing extremely well due to this DIY flash controller you mentioned, and also our shipments of controllers that end up in cloud applications. And so, I think the fourth quarter is a strong increase, and we certainly see all those growth drivers intact, next year, we get the full benefit of that full year of the DIY shipments to our lead customer there. We certainly see cloud computing growing. And then we've also got share gains and preamplifiers. And by the way, I think from a Fiber Channel standpoint, we do expect that in Q4 and beyond that that business trends to a more normal run rate, and I would expect it would not have the same level of volatility we saw earlier this year just given that that was primarily caused by some external shocks relative to COVID-19.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Matt, let me press you a little more on the supply constraint issue just to get a sense of whether it's like $5 million, $10 million, $15 million just some ballpark would help. And then importantly, what does that say about your visibility heading into April? When I look at the current kind of expectations around April, they are for sort of flattish trends versus January, but given this visibility, how should we and these unsolicited orders, what you're referring to as delinquency, how should we think about seasonality heading into April? So just some quantification, and just some color around trends heading into April would be really helpful? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Well, the very first comment, I think, we're certainly pleased that Q4 is up and that's a positive. I think if I just go back up more to 30,000 feet, we're very encouraged about our fiscal '22. As I mentioned earlier, we've got the full year of DIY storage controller. We've got 5G kicking in. There's obviously more growth in cloud and a number of growth drivers. So, I think that we feel very good about for next year. And then I think the slope of that and how that all rolls in, some of that is going to be related to demand, and some of that is also going to also be related to supply and how much progress we can make. At this point, it's a little bit difficult to quantify exactly the amount, but what I would say is that directionally the way the business is heading and the growth drivers we outlined at our Investor Day would certainly support the type of growth that we're anticipating next year. So, I think all that's positive in terms of heading into the fourth quarter and beyond. But where Q1 lands, we'll have to get to that when we go ahead and guide that quarter, I think we'll have much better visibility on the supply dynamics. But certainly in the short-term, you can see from our Q4 guide, demand has been strong. That's also backed up by strong bookings that we've seen, as well as, as I mentioned, we've got a lot of orders sitting out there that we're working very hard to go fulfill.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, Matt. I guess I also wanted to ask about the same topic. And I guess my question is more on timing, and really when you think you'll be able to ship to demand? It sounds like maybe you're getting a little bit of a trade-off here that you're getting a little more longer-term visibility. But I guess my question is really, when do you think you'll be able to ship to demand? And in the fiscal Q4 guidance, does that assume that delinquencies go up versus fiscal Q3? Or does it assume that they stay about the same? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Look Tim, trust me, I wish I could be a little bit more precise. But I think the way to think about it is on the supply side, at least when we talk to our supply chain partners, there is an anticipation that certainly within the first quarter or two in calendar \u201821, that we will see some improvements there. I think a lot of that though depends on how strong the demand environment is. Certainly it's not just us I think signaling that demand is good, I think other companies as well are indicating that. So I'd just say it's a fluid situation. But certainly, we hope within the first quarter or two, in next year that we would be able to get up to that run rate. We take our customer satisfaction very seriously. And we're all hands on deck in terms of how to meet the ramp, and I'm confident we will meet the ramp ultimately. We've just got to -- and I've been through a few of these, since I've been in this industry. And ultimately, these things work themselves out. And we've got a world class operations team, and pretty tight communication with our customers at this point. So it'll get there. And I think we'll start seeing improvements in the first-half. Just to be clear, Tim, just to be clear in Q4, I mean, maybe for Vivek as well, I mean, we would have guided higher in Q4, obviously had we had better access to the supply that we needed.\nTimothy Arcuri: Clear, yes. Thanks, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from C. J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nC. J. Muse: Hey, thank you for taking the question. Sorry to beat a dead horse, Matt, but just curious on the supply constrain side. Are there any particular products within networking that are tighter than others? And then I guess if we can get off of this subject, perhaps you could speak to now that Inphi is expected to be in the fold at Marvell, what are your conversations trending to now with your lead customers? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure, yes, happy to finish the beating, C. J. But really, if you think about it in our networking business, and whether that's in ASIC, or in some of our switches or even some of our PHYs, some of these products are extremely high pin count devices in very complex packages. And as you go to more and more complex substrates especially, you could say with 5G products or processor products there's just been a number of constraints as these substrate factories try to ramp up production on boards and PCBs that are multiples more complex in terms of number of layers, and number of pins than in previous generation. So I think that's putting some constraint. Additionally, the large fabs, the large foundries out there are full. And in some cases, you have legacy nodes, where there's constraints that are a little bit unique. It might be because of who knows, last time buys, I'm not sure from other vendors, but you also have some legacy nodes that actually have some impact, which are a little bit of queue right now. So it's across the board, but again the trend is more on the complex products and more around substrates. And then your second question, C.J., was on Inphi?\nC. J. Muse: Yes, that's right. In terms of your conversations with your leading customers, post the deal announcement, similar to what you discussed, I guess, two years back with Cavium would love to hear, how the reception and whether engagements are accelerating because of bringing this asset into the fold?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks. We've had, I think, a very strong joint engagements, since we announced the combination. And what I would say is pretty much across the board, there's very strong support from the customer base for this combination. I think, one is certainly in the 5G area, they're very happy to have another strong product line to consider. And we've already got some introductions made there. And then on the cloud side, which is really where Inphi is very deep with a number of the large OEMs. I think there's very constructive discussions right now about a number of opportunities. Number of those around ASIC and I think the timing of our 5-nanometer platform, and the traction we're seeing there, actually, that resonates really well. And in many cases, some of these high performance custom ASIC for the cloud, they have direct interfaces to invite optical modules. And so there's actually a fairly tight synergy there between the dense digital logic type of solutions we can provide, connecting to these high performance optical modules that implies enabling. So it's going very well and I think certainly, as we clear the various regulatory approvals, we can engage even more deeply. But that's all going extremely well and it does remind me a lot of the synergy that we saw or very early on when we did Cavium, in terms of the customer reception and the ability to go sell a very joint solution. So I'm pretty excited about it. And I think it's meeting all expectations or better than what I anticipated that reaction would be like.\nC. J. Muse: Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Hi, good afternoon. Matt, thanks for taking my question. Just kind of curious, Matt, on the outlook on the enterprise side, it was up. I'm kind of just curious in your conversations you're looking at next year, whether we could see a bit better cycle on the enterprise side.\nMatt Murphy: Yes, sure. Blayne, I think a couple things. I mean, certainly, there has been a lot of concern about the enterprise market in general. I think we have started to see some positive -- more positive commentary out of some of the large OEMs. So I think that's good. But really, for us, it's sort of a continued story of our own new product introductions and share gain. And so we recently announced in addition to our borderless enterprise portfolio with our auto multi-gig PHYs. We had strong design wins on PHYs in the most recent quarter. Our new switches have got great traction as well. And even in our traditional enterprise NIC and Fibre Channel business, we're also seeing strong design activity. So I think all of that bodes well for us, and it certainly even the short-term helping offset what many might consider to be a more challenging overall enterprise environment. We actually see positive trends into Q4 and we anticipate that's going to continue next year. And then as we even highlighted at the Analyst Day with some new more strategic wins. One example would be in our OCTEON processor area, there's even growth beyond that. So I think we're very excited about the enterprise business as a key part of our portfolio to drive growth, and also be overall accretive to the gross margins of the company. So it's a good business for us. We're investing there, and we're very focused on product leadership in that area.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for the question. Matt, clearly the strength of the story here are all the bottoms up product cycles, and you mentioned a new win in your preamp, I'd love to get a little bit more color, the 5-nanometre OCTEON win against x86. To help us understand, why you think you want that socket? When it starts to ramp? And kind of what the revenue potential there is? And given all the product ramps you have those ramps still live in the real world, and we're still kind of in a macro environment, that's kind of just crawling along. I'm kind of curious, as we get into calendar year '21, if we do see that sort of cyclical recovery in the macro, how much of an accelerant to growth to some of these products cycle, do you think that can be?\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes, so look, I think, if you go back and you look at, and let's even go back all the way to Cavium days, there's been this ongoing, first it was MEPS [ph] and then transitioned to ARM battle in the networking processor area. And Cavium and now Marvell has had a strong position there, great products, but not the share leader. And even in the sort of embedded world x86 has always been very strong. We're very encouraged by where we sit from a product positioning, as we look at our next generation, or 10th generation OCTEON platform, that's going to be coming out in 5-nanometer. And I think it's well understood, beyond well understood some of the challenges the largest player in that market has in terms of their process roadmap. So I think we line up very well from that point-of-view, certainly. But on top of that, we have leadership in architecture, for these types of applications for data plan processing, and very deep relationships with our customers. And so, the win that we highlighted I talked about today, but we have actually talked about at an Investor Day as well was for one of the leading OEMs, not only the United States, but the world who typically makes these types of platform decisions much earlier than others in terms of how they plan. So I would say this is sort of a very positive leading indicator that we got selected after very extensive benchmarking, by the way. And we said at the Investor Day, I think it was in Raghib's presentation that this piece of business alone would be an incremental $100 million a year type of annual socket for us, which is huge for a company like ours. We don't have that many sockets of that nature. But I think that that's a very strong leading indicator, John, that in this next cycle with 5-nanometer ramping. And again, this is going to take -- this is going to manifest itself over the next several years. We think we're in a very strong position there. So I think there's a chance OCTEON could have a much stronger place in the market than it has historically. And then you're right, even in this environment, at least many of the chip companies are performing well, we think we are, and certainly if we get the economy on a macro level moving in the right direction next year that's really not in our assumptions today, I mean we sort of assume that, at least as we plan -- we're planning that, there's still going to be some turbulence. But certainly if the macro improves and there's strength in enterprise spending as an example or businesses are spending again, people are going back to work, et cetera, then I do think it's going to be a left for companies like us. But I think it's a little bit early to tell given all the transitions happening in the world today.\nJohn Pitzer: Thanks, and congratulations.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, John.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nRoss Seymore: Matt, I wanted to dive a little bit into the networking guidance for the quarter and then some longer-term implications. It sounds like pretty much everything is going to be up sequentially, except for two ASIC sides, ASIC on the wireless infrastructure as well as the cloud ASIC side. So are those ASIC pauses -- are those things that are due to the end market weakening, just taking a pause, that be -- I know it's not end of life, but if we already hit kind of a plateau in those businesses? And then the other side, where everything else is up, how much of that do you think is macro getting better sort of a systematic increase versus Marvell specific product cycles driving that sequential growth?\nMatt Murphy: Sure, yes. Thanks, Ross. So on the first part of it, I actually think it's very consistent with a question you've asked me in the past. I think you during one of the investor road shows you hosted where I did a call with a broad set of investors. You said, hey, with some of these markets you're getting into like carrier or like cloud, how do you expect the volatility of those markets to be and those lend themselves to be somewhat lumpier.  And so that is the case, I mean, you did nail that in that in the case of the cloud side has nothing to do with demand, but the pattern in which new products ramp, and you've probably seen this with other semiconductor vendors, it isn't exactly a linear process, they tend to buy a larger quantity early than there might be a quarter of sort of digestion, and then they come back again. So this is actually the strength we saw in Q3 was the beginning of a ramp on this program. And it just they took a large quantity in Q3. Some deployments, they're going to do it in their own data centers through Q4, but certainly we expect that overall program to be up quite a bit in next year, because that's a brand new program and that's just ramping. And then on the 5G side, China has been the most aggressive in terms of 5G rollouts globally. And we've seen that strength actually in China for the last two or three quarters, including Q3 being a strong quarter. And I think it's pretty natural for them to do some absorption as well. And that commentaries, I think, been out there somewhat broadly. We certainly think again, overall next year, that China's 5G deployments should continue. There's still a whole bunch to go and will benefit when that happens. So yes, I think in those cases, Ross, it's really more of just new products ramping, in the case of cloud, and in the case of 5G, it's just a big a normal fluctuation and how the carrier demand lines in. And then I'd say, for our Q4, you're right pretty much across the board, all of our product lines are up. And I would say it's mostly products driven for us. I mean, let's take automotive as an example, we indicated it was crossing over into double-digit millions.  We've seen car production pickup. We had noted we were in a whole bunch of model year '21 vehicles, that's all now booking. And that's, again, a very unique Marvell product cycle in terms of automotive Ethernet that continues, not only through our fiscal '22, but certainly beyond that, as these programs go into high volume. So I would attribute this to be more our own product cycles. But certainly I think if you just talk to other people in the chip industry right now the sentiment is quite bullish in terms of other CEOs and other companies feeling like, it is an overall stronger demand environment out there. But I think we're guiding up, maybe a little bit more than others, just because we do have some unique product cycles that we're a part of.\nRoss Seymore: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you, and congratulations on the results. And Matt, thank you for the sort of preview on ORAN, VRAN. I was hoping you could elaborate a little bit more of the company's positioning there. Maybe not as much of the technology side, but kind of more on the business model and how that supply chain works. My understanding, it's going to be more of a white box market. So any color you could share with us there on the positioning would be great.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes, I'll continue a little bit of my mini preview. But I think Tore you should expect relatively soon we'll be doing a pretty comprehensive release on ORAN and VRAN by the way in terms of how we're going to play, how we fit in the market. And it'll be a combination of technology and also segmentation. But, I think to keep it at a higher level, it is an interesting potential disruption that's out there, and it certainly gained momentum in terms of the conversations we're having over the last six to nine months. I do think there will be -- I think it will get deployed in some areas. And I view it in a couple ways. One, I think there are smaller emerging players who would be more in the white box model. And you should assume, we're going to have more of a standard offering that leverages all of the IP that we've already developed, and is a fairly efficient way to get merchant products out into the market. And that's available today. As you know, we're shipping macro class, 5G baseband processors today. So I think we're in the best position of any company quickly to go do that. At the same time, the large incumbent players in RAN are not asleep at the wheel. And I think each of them will have their own go-to-market around ORAN and VRAN. And the [indiscernible] customers were also a key provider to them already for the macro. And so I think we have an ability to support the traditional players who probably have to grapple with some level of innovators dilemma on this market, in terms of how they go about it, and how they play and how they manage it. And then there's a set of upstarts that we can also address. So more on that later, but I think it won't be just white box and sort of startup companies. I think it'll be a combination of the two. And I think it'll take some time to play out Tore, I don't think this is an overnight sensation, and probably will go because sort of map the hype cycle curve on it, like we've seen with a lot of other emerging technologies. ORAN probably looks a lot like that. And so you can pick your place on the hype cycle, it's probably on the way up, and there'll be a point where it's probably got a pause, and then at some point, it'll make an impact. But we certainly plan to be there, but in a way that enables the broader market, and leverages all the development we've already done. I think that's the key part is doing this in an R&D efficient way, which enables us to participate in it.\nTore Svanberg: Very helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. It looks like capacity optimized or near line HDD shipments are looking or starting to pick up this quarter ahead of what looks to be a reacceleration in cloud spending, starting kind of first-half of next year. I think your two lead HDD customers are well into the ramp of 16 terabytes, but they're also starting to qualify 18 as well. And as we progress through next year, it sort of looks like 18 is going to be the sweet spot for volume. So what's my last dollar content opportunity on 18 versus 16 with your two lead customers? And is the team starting to get visibility on continued strength in your near line business over the next several quarters?\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Harlan, I think the corollary around cloud demand and cloud strength certainly ripples back in the near line. So, we do see that in the short-term. As you probably know that the big move for us is really the ability to get preamplifiers in terms of the content. And so we have certainly one account that we're shipping with today along with controllers. So beyond that the content from a controller and even plus preamplifier standpoint, doesn't change all that much from these generations. I think the big mover for us is if we can get more preamp engagements in the near line side. We certainly have one that's already publicly announced and we're working on more. But I think ASPs content, as you get to these high capacity drives is going to be fairly similar from generation-to-generation and that goes for 18, it goes for 20, it goes for beyond. Unfortunately, that's always the challenge is there's just tremendous Exabyte growth and tremendous data storage growth happening, the controllers unfortunately don't get the same type of ASP uplift to them. Although, we've managed to get a little bit more value, generation-to-generation, but it's very incremental relative to the bank for the buck the cloud customers get by going from a 16 to an 18, or an 18 to a 20. We don't see that in our ASPs. But it's good business and we certainly had a lot of value there.\nHarlan Sur: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks for the question, guys. I also thought the top of rack switch announcement at a hyper scalar was interesting as well. You've previously focused on the enterprise market, rather than the market where we're really talking about speeds and feeds, but it looks like there could be a more of a shift there. And I was wondering if that is the case and perhaps you can describe your capabilities there. Is this all coming out of Israel right now? And what else would you have to do to try to catch up with the incumbent here?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, so let me be really clear, Chris. For the Marvell designed business that has been classically focused on enterprise switching, campus switching, soho, core and aggregation switching and that's been our sweet spot, that's where we've been growing. When you go to the speeds and feeds and cloud side, we don't have a development internally on that. So the reference, I think, that you're pointing to, is an ASIC win that we have. And we actually have a number of these that we're working on from the Avera business. And now, it's Marvell business because, in some cases, we won these since we joined forces. So the way that we think about accessing that kind of high end top of racks switch market, actually, we think we're probably better served at this point, supplying custom ASIC to people who want to compete in that market. And I would say that for global usage, whether it's across the super seven. And that also gives us a nice strategic entree as well as we think about when we could join forces with Inphi and the roadmap really looking more and more to go to co-package optics. Our ability to be I would call more open source there and really support the ecosystem and support the broader set of companies that are doing these that aren't the market leader. I think it's good for us. I think we sort of think the returns to do that or probably better than if we just tried to go head-to-head, which we've said for many years is just not our strategy. I do think the large competitor there who is the market leader, they just announced a new product. I think that's actually good, because it's showing from an optic standpoint, that it's going to continue to drive the need for optics. And that's going to be a tailwind, ultimately, for people like Inphi. So we have to think it through, Chris, in terms of how we go in there. But today, just to be very clear, the win that we announced was custom ASIC with another company who were doing a high end switch for.\nOperator: And today's final question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Hi, Matt. I have a follow-up to one of the previous questions. Matt, if I look at your networking guidance, you said Samsung will be up, Nokia will be up in 5G, but the ASIC business is down. So if you could please clarify if 5G in total is growing or declining or flattish. And then, as we head into the next year, first-half of next year, if you could qualitatively talk about what you're thinking or how have you looking at Samsung and Nokia, continuing ramps in the first-half? And also as far as ASIC is concerned is the rebound or recovery in ASIC is a pretty much a function of China coming back? Or do you see any other regions helping that market to recover? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure, yes. So I think it -- and I kind of starting at the high level first. The nice thing about our portfolio Srini is we have both these ASIC opportunities that are now materialized mostly driving China and then we have our other two lead customers for the Marvell stuff. And there's a great example of where we had a lot of strength early on through the China ramp on our ASIC business, that's somewhat moderated.  And now the good news is, we see Samsung showing a lot of strength, which is great, we invested a lot there. And I think, it's very encouraging to see that, that really start to go. And then we've got the new wins that Nokia that are, I think well understood. And so that's just starting. If you look at Q4, it'll be our, we're guiding it to be our sixth straight sequential quarter-over-quarter growth quarter for 5G. So in aggregate, it's going to continue to grow. And it has been growing and I think others in this communications market have seen a little bit more volatility during different parts of the last call it four to six quarters, because, in general, the other players are more established, they were bigger in 4G. And so our play is really we're emerging, we're gaining share in 5G, we have new programs ramping, we have new customers ramping, and we've got this nice mix now and diversity such that even if one region or geography has a digestion quarter, we've got the others kicking in. And certainly, we anticipate that next year we'll see growth across the board. We think China should resume and we see our lead customer continuing to ramp, especially as the U.S. starts to deploy. I think there's going to be a lot of need to go do that, especially with the 5G iPhone selling as well as they appear to be. And also if you look at Qualcomm's forecast next year of 500 million 5G enabled phones, I think that's going to drive a lot of demand for networks. And between the design win positions we have with the leading players who will supply the leading early geographies, we think we're in very good shape for our fiscal '22 next year.\nSrini Pajjuri: Got it. Thanks Matt.\nMatt Murphy: No problem.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.\nAshish Saran: Thanks. Thanks, guys. We look forward to talking to all of you again next quarter.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Matt Murphy",
            "content": "Great. Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. The third quarter was an exciting and exceptionally busy time for the Marvell team, as we hosted our 2020 Investor Day, and soon after announced plans for our transformational acquisition of Inphi. These were both significant events which continued to generate strong interest from the financial community. So before I discuss our quarterly results, let me summarize the growth strategy we articulated at our Investor Day, and the benefits we expect to drive from the combination with Inphi. During our Virtual Investor Day, we discussed the importance of choosing the right end market, building a larger base of key customers, and driving technology platform leadership aligned with the most exciting growth drivers in the industry. We discussed our focus on the data infrastructure market, a $110 billion total semiconductor opportunity for Marvell, of which we are currently servicing $16 billion, and that we expect to grow 50% faster than the TAM over the next few years. We showcased the expansion we expect to drive in our base of Tier 1 $100 million plus customers to a total of 13 over the next couple of years. We outlined the evolution of our technology roadmap to being first to market with the 5-nanometer platform for portfolio wide leadership. We concluded with our compelling long-term growth vision focused on 5G, cloud, and automotive end markets. At the event, we also disclosed the number of new design wins, which we believe will contribute meaningfully towards revenue growth over the next several years. In 5G, we announced the second customer for OCTEON and the radio head, as well as two additional base station customers for Ethernet products. In the enterprise market, we announced a broader footprint for our Ethernet switches and PHYs at two Tier 1 North American networking OEMs. One of these OEMs also selected our next generation 5-nanometer OCTEON processors to replace their current x86 Solutions across their entire enterprise router platforms. In our storage business, we won a cloud datacenter, DIY SSD controller and announced a new Tier 1 NAND OEM for our merchant SSD controllers. Consistent with the strategy we discussed at Investor Day, on October 29, we announced our plans to combine with Inphi in a highly complementary and strategic transaction and expected to accelerate our growth and leadership in the fast-growing cloud and 5G markets. We discussed multiple benefits expected to result from this merger, including a larger and faster growing addressable market, a broadening of our Tier 1 cloud customer base, greater scale for our 5- and 3-nanometer platforms, an exceptionally talented SerDes team, and an even stronger long-term financial model. We also discussed significant opportunities for cross selling, which would represent upside to the target operating model. Since the announcement, we have been able to discuss the benefits of this merger with employees, customers, partners, and shareholders of both companies. These discussions have further strengthened our conviction in all the key strategic elements of this exciting transaction. We've had the opportunity to meet with a broader cross section of Inphi employees and continue to be highly impressed with their depth of technical capability, focus on innovation, and seamless program execution. The Marvell and Inphi teams are well aligned from a cultural perspective with many shared values and core beliefs. Similar to the approach we've taken in our prior acquisitions, we are looking forward to integrating Inphi employees across all levels of the combined company. I can already sense that the sales, product management, and engineering teams on both sides are chomping at the bit so they can start driving new revenue growth opportunities. Let's dig a little deeper into these opportunities, which we expect will result from the strong positions established by Marvell in 5G and Inphi and cloud. We believe that having a leading product at the heart of the customer's architecture is critical as it sets the cadence of technology adoption and pulls along additional products into the full solution. We saw this play out effectively following the Cavium acquisition, and you are all now familiar with the significant increase in content and customer expansion we were able to drive in 5G, as a combined company. In base stations, the front, mid, and backhaul connectivity is primarily optical. And with the emergence of 5G, the speed and bandwidth of these links needs to increase substantially. Inphi's high performance PAM4 and coherent DSP-based electro-optics solutions are perfectly aligned to deliver these higher speeds. We believe that Marvell's leadership in embedded processors for 5G infrastructure will better position Inphi to participate in the optical conductivity opportunity. In cloud, Inphi's electro optics platform is critical to data center architecture, and they have established direct relationships with the industry's largest cloud infrastructure providers. Inphi's recent results and guidance illustrate the benefits of having a strong presence in the cloud market. For their third quarter of fiscal 2020, they reported revenue growth of 92% year over year, and the organic portion of their business grew 57% year over year. We're excited to see that they expect growth to continue in the fourth quarter with Inphi revenue guided to grow 82% year-over-year at the midpoint. Marvell also has a growing presence in the cloud market, and merging with Inphi is expected to create multiple $100 million plus cloud customers for the combined company. We expect to drive numerous revenue growth opportunities for ASICs and DPUs with these large cloud customers. Within cloud data centers, we expect compute for AI and other use cases to increasingly require tailored solutions, resulting in an expansion of custom and ASIC opportunities for the combined company. In cloud, custom compute engines in ASICs are often connected directly to external optics, such as in a machine learning cluster. This presents a unique opportunity for the combined company to tightly integrate optics inside ASICs and custom compute processors through onboard and co-packaged optics solutions. Cloud customers are particularly excited about this capability. In addition to the ASIC opportunities I just discussed, we expect similar benefits to Marvell's cloud DPU business. Today, Marvell's DPUs or SmartNICs is standard product to cloud customers. In the short-term, we see a greater opportunity to win more business for our existing products. In the longer-term, we can provide higher value DPU solutions with tightly integrated onboard and co-package optics. Since announcing the deal, we have completed a number of initial meetings with key customers. While any detailed joint roadmap discussions will need to wait until receipt of all regulatory approvals, customer reactions from the meeting so far have been extremely positive, and they have already identified multiple new opportunities for Marvell. In fact, I've been personally involved in a number of these discussions, and I am now even more confident in the potential for new revenue growth opportunities. Let me move on now to our quarterly results and expectations. Revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2021 was $750 million, growing 3% sequentially and 13% year-over-year. Stronger than expected revenue growth from our networking business offset weaker than anticipated results from storage. Our GAAP loss per share was $0.03, our non-GAAP earnings per share were $0.25, growing 19% sequentially and 47% year-over-year. I'm pleased with the growth in revenue and earnings we have been able to drive in the third quarter. We are projecting strong growth in the fourth quarter as demand from customers continues to increase. Our operations team is continuing to ramp production with our global supply chain partners. However, we have begun to experience a number of industry wide supply constraints affecting the type of high complexity products we provide for data infrastructure. The rapid recovery this year in the semiconductor industry appears to be stressing significant portions of the supply chain. These supply challenges are currently limiting our ability to fully satisfy, the increase in demand for some of our networking products. Let's now discuss our two businesses in more detail. First in our networking business, revenue during the quarter was $445 million and grew 10% sequentially and 35% year-over-year. Revenue growth was stronger than our expectations of mid to high-single-digit sequential growth and overall this was a very strong quarter across a broad base of our products and end markets including 5G, cloud, automotive and enterprise. In 5G, we delivered our fifth straight quarter of sequential revenue growth. In the first-half of this year, 5G growth was driven primarily from our ASIC business benefiting from the rapid deployments in China. In the third quarter, while the wireless infrastructure ASIC business remains strong, the sequential growth was driven primarily by standard and semi-custom product shipments to Samsung. The rollout of 5G outside of China is starting to pick up, and we expect consumer demand for 5G services will continue to grow worldwide, following the launch of new 5G phones from Apple. As we look forward, we expect 5G momentum to accelerate through next year in multiple regions including the U.S. and Japan. Our 5G customer base continues to expand and the second regional customer has selected Marvell's industry leading OCTEON fusion-based NAND processors to power their new 5G base stations. They plan to engage with Marvell on a variety of RAN architectures, including emerging ORAN initiatives, enabling them to flexibly address the needs of network operators regardless of the network topology being deployed. Let me take a moment to preview Marvell's efforts in the emerging, Open RAN, and virtualized RAN architectures. These are commonly referred to as ORAN and VRAN respectively. Global operators are driving toward open standards-based interfaces with the RAN to enable multi-vendor interoperability. In addition, the use of virtualization to separate hardware and software has begun making its way into the radio access network. Now, whether virtual or physical, the complexity of 5G processing, real time latency requirements, and the tight power envelope necessitate optimized hardware acceleration to be deployed at scale. We addressed this need with our OCTEON fusion processors, the industry's leading silicon platform for 5G-based band and radio processing. We're adding more capabilities to this proven technology to further optimize it for open virtual environments. We will soon unveil details of our new VRAN accelerator, which is based on OCTEON fusion, designed to support an open and interoperable ecosystem with a full set of ORAN standards-based interfaces. By adding ORAN and VRAN capabilities to our existing 5G offerings, Marvell will be the ideal semiconductor partner with a complete 5G platform capable of supporting all RAN architectures on common hardware and software framework. This is a critical differentiator for Marvell given that beyond a few Greenfield deployments, most 5G networks will have a complex hybrid architecture to support a diverse set of deployment scenarios. I look forward to discussing the continued evolution of our 5G platform. Moving on to our ASIC business, we've benefited from a strong ramp in a new cloud program and we are excited about this opportunity. I would note that similar to other cloud programs, we expect purchasing patterns for the new ASIC to be somewhat lumpy with demand fluctuations in any given quarter. We recently announced our 112 gig 5-nanometers SerDes solution that has been fully validated in hardware and is ready for adoption by customers. We believe that this technology with industry leading performance, power is an area will help drive 100 gig as the interconnect of choice for next generation data infrastructure. Our ASIC business is the first beneficiary of this leading edge IP, and I'm very pleased that we have secured a new custom ASIC design win that will embed our 112 gig SerDes in next generation top of rack and spine switches for leading hyperscale data centers. Turning to our automotive business, industry production appears to be recovering from COVID-19 impacts earlier in the year. We're also seeing record bookings and have started ramping multiple Ethernet design wins in model year 2021 vehicles. These ramps drove strong revenue growth in the third quarter and we expect growth to continue in the fourth quarter and into fiscal 2022. In our enterprise end market, we continue to refresh our Ethernet products and recently introduced the second generation of our Octal multi-gig PHY family. These are the newest additions to Marvell's borderless enterprise portfolio, comprehensive set of switches and PHYs architected to address the specific requirements of emerging mobility and cloud applications that are extending the boundaries of the traditional campus environment. The new PHY family offers a clear upgrade path to multi gigabit technology. We believe that an increase in customer interest for our multi-gig products and our recent design win momentum are strong leading indicators that the industry is getting ready for a much broader multi-gig adoption. During the quarter we closed multi-gig PHY design wins with six customers across access points, gateway, switches and firewalls. We are also getting very strong traction with our refresh switches and PHYs with multiple security hardware customers. Now let me discuss the outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter for our networking business. We expect growth from 5G to continue with Samsung and the start of a ramp into Nokia, partially offset by a decline in 5G ASICs, as deployments in China take a pause. We project a strong quarter for our automotive business, with quarterly revenue expected to cross in double-digit millions. We expect enterprise switching to continue to improve as we ramp new products. We also expect growth from our liquid security DPU shipping to cloud customers. Offsetting this growth, we project a sequential decline in revenue from our cloud ASIC. As a result after a very strong third quarter, we expect networking revenue in the fourth quarter to be approximately flat on a sequential basis, and on a year-over-year basis projected to grow approximately 25%, compared to the fourth quarter fiscal 2020 results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, we are currently supply constrained on some of our networking products. Now turning to our storage business. Storage revenue for the third quarter was $276 million declining 5% sequentially, lower expectations of being flat. During the quarter demand for Fibre Channel products from our enterprise server and storage customers was impacted more heavily than anticipated, although we expect this level of weakness to be temporary. On the other hand, the sequential revenue growth we had expected from our storage controller business did materialize, led by a ramp on our custom SSD controllers. Our cloud HDD business also grew sequentially. At this year's virtual flash memory summit, our storage team had another strong show and alongside HPE, we were named a Best of Show award winner for the Marvell based NVMe RAID boot SSD. HPE is the first of Marvell's partners to support this new accelerator, the product lowers data center total cost of ownership by offloading RAID 1 processing from costly server CPU resources, maximizing application performance. In addition, we demonstrated our latest data center flash controller for building large capacity ultra-low latency, high performance SSDs and our low power 12-nanometre PCIe Gen4 controller for client SSDs. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect our storage business to rebound strongly and project sequential revenue growth in the low teens on a percentage basis. We expect this growth to be driven from multiple products. We project a strong recovery in our Fibre Channel business towards a more normalized run rate. We also expect our cloud storage revenue to continue to grow, which includes more meaningful contribution from our preamplifiers. In addition, we are projecting the start of a product ramp of a cloud DIY SSD controller design win, I mentioned in my opening remarks. In closing, our results and guidance continue to progress in the right direction. We are projecting fiscal 2021 fourth quarter revenue at the midpoint of guidance to grow approximately 9% year-over-year and grow 13% year-over-year for the ongoing business as compared to last year's fourth quarter results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi. We continue to work closely with our supply chain partners to alleviate constraints and meet the growing demand from our customers. Through this fiscal year, which has certainly had a share of COVID-19-related challenges, I'm very pleased with the growth we have driven from 5G and cloud, and it is still early days for us in these two critical end markets. In addition, our automotive and preamplifier businesses are now starting to contribute more meaningfully. Our custom SSD controller programs have recently started to ramp and we will benefit from a full year of shipments in fiscal 2022. We also expect that a refreshed Ethernet switch and PHY products will enable us to take share in the enterprise and carrier end markets. From a broader perspective, there has been encouraging news on the vaccine front, which bodes well for a macro economic recovery next year. Overall, the setup for fiscal year 2022 looks very promising. Equally exciting, we are looking forward to combining with Inphi to accelerate our joint vision to lead the ongoing transformation in the fast growing cloud and 5G markets. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Sure. Yes, as we noted, we have seen a number of constraints, I would say over the last few quarters, by the way in certain process node bottlenecks as well as I think it's fairly widely known there's significant increase in demand this year for complex substrates as well. And so, we've seen this tightness, we're managing through it. The way I would think about it is, we've had a historically a fairly steady level of delinquency that we enter every quarter with delinquency being defined as the amount of product that we had got request dates for in the current quarter in, that we can't supply within the quarter, and that's something that we track on a regular basis. Heading into Q4, that number is significantly larger than we've had. And part of that is customers, due to the constraints out there have also placed longer lead times on us. So, I think we're pleased to be able to guide up sequentially. And certainly, if you look year-over-year, the business is up quite strongly overall especially in our networking business. So, we're happy about that. But I guess what I would say is, you should think about it as we're like many other companies, I think carrying a significantly higher level of delinquency than we have historically. Sure. No, I think the thesis from Investor Day is certainly still intact, and we are pleased to see a nice upswing in the fourth quarter, understanding that Q3 was a little bit weaker, and we did have this somewhat unusual lumpiness in Fibre Channel, which I think as you know, historically has been a relatively stable business. But given some of the impacts earlier this year with supply chain on boards, and some of the COVID-19-related impacts on enterprise, that business did have a lot more volatility to it than we've normally experienced. Offsetting that, obviously, has been very, very strong growth in our traditional Marvell storage controller business, which is by the way the business that normally has been historically a little bit more lumpy, that one's performing extremely well due to this DIY flash controller you mentioned, and also our shipments of controllers that end up in cloud applications. And so, I think the fourth quarter is a strong increase, and we certainly see all those growth drivers intact, next year, we get the full benefit of that full year of the DIY shipments to our lead customer there. We certainly see cloud computing growing. And then we've also got share gains and preamplifiers. And by the way, I think from a Fiber Channel standpoint, we do expect that in Q4 and beyond that that business trends to a more normal run rate, and I would expect it would not have the same level of volatility we saw earlier this year just given that that was primarily caused by some external shocks relative to COVID-19. Sure. Well, the very first comment, I think, we're certainly pleased that Q4 is up and that's a positive. I think if I just go back up more to 30,000 feet, we're very encouraged about our fiscal '22. As I mentioned earlier, we've got the full year of DIY storage controller. We've got 5G kicking in. There's obviously more growth in cloud and a number of growth drivers. So, I think that we feel very good about for next year. And then I think the slope of that and how that all rolls in, some of that is going to be related to demand, and some of that is also going to also be related to supply and how much progress we can make. At this point, it's a little bit difficult to quantify exactly the amount, but what I would say is that directionally the way the business is heading and the growth drivers we outlined at our Investor Day would certainly support the type of growth that we're anticipating next year. So, I think all that's positive in terms of heading into the fourth quarter and beyond. But where Q1 lands, we'll have to get to that when we go ahead and guide that quarter, I think we'll have much better visibility on the supply dynamics. But certainly in the short-term, you can see from our Q4 guide, demand has been strong. That's also backed up by strong bookings that we've seen, as well as, as I mentioned, we've got a lot of orders sitting out there that we're working very hard to go fulfill. Yes. Look Tim, trust me, I wish I could be a little bit more precise. But I think the way to think about it is on the supply side, at least when we talk to our supply chain partners, there is an anticipation that certainly within the first quarter or two in calendar \u201821, that we will see some improvements there. I think a lot of that though depends on how strong the demand environment is. Certainly it's not just us I think signaling that demand is good, I think other companies as well are indicating that. So I'd just say it's a fluid situation. But certainly, we hope within the first quarter or two, in next year that we would be able to get up to that run rate. We take our customer satisfaction very seriously. And we're all hands on deck in terms of how to meet the ramp, and I'm confident we will meet the ramp ultimately. We've just got to -- and I've been through a few of these, since I've been in this industry. And ultimately, these things work themselves out. And we've got a world class operations team, and pretty tight communication with our customers at this point. So it'll get there. And I think we'll start seeing improvements in the first-half. Just to be clear, Tim, just to be clear in Q4, I mean, maybe for Vivek as well, I mean, we would have guided higher in Q4, obviously had we had better access to the supply that we needed. Yes. Sure, yes, happy to finish the beating, C. J. But really, if you think about it in our networking business, and whether that's in ASIC, or in some of our switches or even some of our PHYs, some of these products are extremely high pin count devices in very complex packages. And as you go to more and more complex substrates especially, you could say with 5G products or processor products there's just been a number of constraints as these substrate factories try to ramp up production on boards and PCBs that are multiples more complex in terms of number of layers, and number of pins than in previous generation. So I think that's putting some constraint. Additionally, the large fabs, the large foundries out there are full. And in some cases, you have legacy nodes, where there's constraints that are a little bit unique. It might be because of who knows, last time buys, I'm not sure from other vendors, but you also have some legacy nodes that actually have some impact, which are a little bit of queue right now. So it's across the board, but again the trend is more on the complex products and more around substrates. And then your second question, C.J., was on Inphi? Yes. Thanks. We've had, I think, a very strong joint engagements, since we announced the combination. And what I would say is pretty much across the board, there's very strong support from the customer base for this combination. I think, one is certainly in the 5G area, they're very happy to have another strong product line to consider. And we've already got some introductions made there. And then on the cloud side, which is really where Inphi is very deep with a number of the large OEMs. I think there's very constructive discussions right now about a number of opportunities. Number of those around ASIC and I think the timing of our 5-nanometer platform, and the traction we're seeing there, actually, that resonates really well. And in many cases, some of these high performance custom ASIC for the cloud, they have direct interfaces to invite optical modules. And so there's actually a fairly tight synergy there between the dense digital logic type of solutions we can provide, connecting to these high performance optical modules that implies enabling. So it's going very well and I think certainly, as we clear the various regulatory approvals, we can engage even more deeply. But that's all going extremely well and it does remind me a lot of the synergy that we saw or very early on when we did Cavium, in terms of the customer reception and the ability to go sell a very joint solution. So I'm pretty excited about it. And I think it's meeting all expectations or better than what I anticipated that reaction would be like. Sure. Yes, sure. Blayne, I think a couple things. I mean, certainly, there has been a lot of concern about the enterprise market in general. I think we have started to see some positive -- more positive commentary out of some of the large OEMs. So I think that's good. But really, for us, it's sort of a continued story of our own new product introductions and share gain. And so we recently announced in addition to our borderless enterprise portfolio with our auto multi-gig PHYs. We had strong design wins on PHYs in the most recent quarter. Our new switches have got great traction as well. And even in our traditional enterprise NIC and Fibre Channel business, we're also seeing strong design activity. So I think all of that bodes well for us, and it certainly even the short-term helping offset what many might consider to be a more challenging overall enterprise environment. We actually see positive trends into Q4 and we anticipate that's going to continue next year. And then as we even highlighted at the Analyst Day with some new more strategic wins. One example would be in our OCTEON processor area, there's even growth beyond that. So I think we're very excited about the enterprise business as a key part of our portfolio to drive growth, and also be overall accretive to the gross margins of the company. So it's a good business for us. We're investing there, and we're very focused on product leadership in that area. Sure. Yes, so look, I think, if you go back and you look at, and let's even go back all the way to Cavium days, there's been this ongoing, first it was MEPS [ph] and then transitioned to ARM battle in the networking processor area. And Cavium and now Marvell has had a strong position there, great products, but not the share leader. And even in the sort of embedded world x86 has always been very strong. We're very encouraged by where we sit from a product positioning, as we look at our next generation, or 10th generation OCTEON platform, that's going to be coming out in 5-nanometer. And I think it's well understood, beyond well understood some of the challenges the largest player in that market has in terms of their process roadmap. So I think we line up very well from that point-of-view, certainly. But on top of that, we have leadership in architecture, for these types of applications for data plan processing, and very deep relationships with our customers. And so, the win that we highlighted I talked about today, but we have actually talked about at an Investor Day as well was for one of the leading OEMs, not only the United States, but the world who typically makes these types of platform decisions much earlier than others in terms of how they plan. So I would say this is sort of a very positive leading indicator that we got selected after very extensive benchmarking, by the way. And we said at the Investor Day, I think it was in Raghib's presentation that this piece of business alone would be an incremental $100 million a year type of annual socket for us, which is huge for a company like ours. We don't have that many sockets of that nature. But I think that that's a very strong leading indicator, John, that in this next cycle with 5-nanometer ramping. And again, this is going to take -- this is going to manifest itself over the next several years. We think we're in a very strong position there. So I think there's a chance OCTEON could have a much stronger place in the market than it has historically. And then you're right, even in this environment, at least many of the chip companies are performing well, we think we are, and certainly if we get the economy on a macro level moving in the right direction next year that's really not in our assumptions today, I mean we sort of assume that, at least as we plan -- we're planning that, there's still going to be some turbulence. But certainly if the macro improves and there's strength in enterprise spending as an example or businesses are spending again, people are going back to work, et cetera, then I do think it's going to be a left for companies like us. But I think it's a little bit early to tell given all the transitions happening in the world today. Yes. Thanks, John. Sure, yes. Thanks, Ross. So on the first part of it, I actually think it's very consistent with a question you've asked me in the past. I think you during one of the investor road shows you hosted where I did a call with a broad set of investors. You said, hey, with some of these markets you're getting into like carrier or like cloud, how do you expect the volatility of those markets to be and those lend themselves to be somewhat lumpier.  And so that is the case, I mean, you did nail that in that in the case of the cloud side has nothing to do with demand, but the pattern in which new products ramp, and you've probably seen this with other semiconductor vendors, it isn't exactly a linear process, they tend to buy a larger quantity early than there might be a quarter of sort of digestion, and then they come back again. So this is actually the strength we saw in Q3 was the beginning of a ramp on this program. And it just they took a large quantity in Q3. Some deployments, they're going to do it in their own data centers through Q4, but certainly we expect that overall program to be up quite a bit in next year, because that's a brand new program and that's just ramping. And then on the 5G side, China has been the most aggressive in terms of 5G rollouts globally. And we've seen that strength actually in China for the last two or three quarters, including Q3 being a strong quarter. And I think it's pretty natural for them to do some absorption as well. And that commentaries, I think, been out there somewhat broadly. We certainly think again, overall next year, that China's 5G deployments should continue. There's still a whole bunch to go and will benefit when that happens. So yes, I think in those cases, Ross, it's really more of just new products ramping, in the case of cloud, and in the case of 5G, it's just a big a normal fluctuation and how the carrier demand lines in. And then I'd say, for our Q4, you're right pretty much across the board, all of our product lines are up. And I would say it's mostly products driven for us. I mean, let's take automotive as an example, we indicated it was crossing over into double-digit millions.  We've seen car production pickup. We had noted we were in a whole bunch of model year '21 vehicles, that's all now booking. And that's, again, a very unique Marvell product cycle in terms of automotive Ethernet that continues, not only through our fiscal '22, but certainly beyond that, as these programs go into high volume. So I would attribute this to be more our own product cycles. But certainly I think if you just talk to other people in the chip industry right now the sentiment is quite bullish in terms of other CEOs and other companies feeling like, it is an overall stronger demand environment out there. But I think we're guiding up, maybe a little bit more than others, just because we do have some unique product cycles that we're a part of. Sure. Yes, I'll continue a little bit of my mini preview. But I think Tore you should expect relatively soon we'll be doing a pretty comprehensive release on ORAN and VRAN by the way in terms of how we're going to play, how we fit in the market. And it'll be a combination of technology and also segmentation. But, I think to keep it at a higher level, it is an interesting potential disruption that's out there, and it certainly gained momentum in terms of the conversations we're having over the last six to nine months. I do think there will be -- I think it will get deployed in some areas. And I view it in a couple ways. One, I think there are smaller emerging players who would be more in the white box model. And you should assume, we're going to have more of a standard offering that leverages all of the IP that we've already developed, and is a fairly efficient way to get merchant products out into the market. And that's available today. As you know, we're shipping macro class, 5G baseband processors today. So I think we're in the best position of any company quickly to go do that. At the same time, the large incumbent players in RAN are not asleep at the wheel. And I think each of them will have their own go-to-market around ORAN and VRAN. And the [indiscernible] customers were also a key provider to them already for the macro. And so I think we have an ability to support the traditional players who probably have to grapple with some level of innovators dilemma on this market, in terms of how they go about it, and how they play and how they manage it. And then there's a set of upstarts that we can also address. So more on that later, but I think it won't be just white box and sort of startup companies. I think it'll be a combination of the two. And I think it'll take some time to play out Tore, I don't think this is an overnight sensation, and probably will go because sort of map the hype cycle curve on it, like we've seen with a lot of other emerging technologies. ORAN probably looks a lot like that. And so you can pick your place on the hype cycle, it's probably on the way up, and there'll be a point where it's probably got a pause, and then at some point, it'll make an impact. But we certainly plan to be there, but in a way that enables the broader market, and leverages all the development we've already done. I think that's the key part is doing this in an R&D efficient way, which enables us to participate in it. Yes. Sure. Harlan, I think the corollary around cloud demand and cloud strength certainly ripples back in the near line. So, we do see that in the short-term. As you probably know that the big move for us is really the ability to get preamplifiers in terms of the content. And so we have certainly one account that we're shipping with today along with controllers. So beyond that the content from a controller and even plus preamplifier standpoint, doesn't change all that much from these generations. I think the big mover for us is if we can get more preamp engagements in the near line side. We certainly have one that's already publicly announced and we're working on more. But I think ASPs content, as you get to these high capacity drives is going to be fairly similar from generation-to-generation and that goes for 18, it goes for 20, it goes for beyond. Unfortunately, that's always the challenge is there's just tremendous Exabyte growth and tremendous data storage growth happening, the controllers unfortunately don't get the same type of ASP uplift to them. Although, we've managed to get a little bit more value, generation-to-generation, but it's very incremental relative to the bank for the buck the cloud customers get by going from a 16 to an 18, or an 18 to a 20. We don't see that in our ASPs. But it's good business and we certainly had a lot of value there. Yes, so let me be really clear, Chris. For the Marvell designed business that has been classically focused on enterprise switching, campus switching, soho, core and aggregation switching and that's been our sweet spot, that's where we've been growing. When you go to the speeds and feeds and cloud side, we don't have a development internally on that. So the reference, I think, that you're pointing to, is an ASIC win that we have. And we actually have a number of these that we're working on from the Avera business. And now, it's Marvell business because, in some cases, we won these since we joined forces. So the way that we think about accessing that kind of high end top of racks switch market, actually, we think we're probably better served at this point, supplying custom ASIC to people who want to compete in that market. And I would say that for global usage, whether it's across the super seven. And that also gives us a nice strategic entree as well as we think about when we could join forces with Inphi and the roadmap really looking more and more to go to co-package optics. Our ability to be I would call more open source there and really support the ecosystem and support the broader set of companies that are doing these that aren't the market leader. I think it's good for us. I think we sort of think the returns to do that or probably better than if we just tried to go head-to-head, which we've said for many years is just not our strategy. I do think the large competitor there who is the market leader, they just announced a new product. I think that's actually good, because it's showing from an optic standpoint, that it's going to continue to drive the need for optics. And that's going to be a tailwind, ultimately, for people like Inphi. So we have to think it through, Chris, in terms of how we go in there. But today, just to be very clear, the win that we announced was custom ASIC with another company who were doing a high end switch for. Sure, yes. So I think it -- and I kind of starting at the high level first. The nice thing about our portfolio Srini is we have both these ASIC opportunities that are now materialized mostly driving China and then we have our other two lead customers for the Marvell stuff. And there's a great example of where we had a lot of strength early on through the China ramp on our ASIC business, that's somewhat moderated.  And now the good news is, we see Samsung showing a lot of strength, which is great, we invested a lot there. And I think, it's very encouraging to see that, that really start to go. And then we've got the new wins that Nokia that are, I think well understood. And so that's just starting. If you look at Q4, it'll be our, we're guiding it to be our sixth straight sequential quarter-over-quarter growth quarter for 5G. So in aggregate, it's going to continue to grow. And it has been growing and I think others in this communications market have seen a little bit more volatility during different parts of the last call it four to six quarters, because, in general, the other players are more established, they were bigger in 4G. And so our play is really we're emerging, we're gaining share in 5G, we have new programs ramping, we have new customers ramping, and we've got this nice mix now and diversity such that even if one region or geography has a digestion quarter, we've got the others kicking in. And certainly, we anticipate that next year we'll see growth across the board. We think China should resume and we see our lead customer continuing to ramp, especially as the U.S. starts to deploy. I think there's going to be a lot of need to go do that, especially with the 5G iPhone selling as well as they appear to be. And also if you look at Qualcomm's forecast next year of 500 million 5G enabled phones, I think that's going to drive a lot of demand for networks. And between the design win positions we have with the leading players who will supply the leading early geographies, we think we're in very good shape for our fiscal '22 next year. No problem."

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thank you, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue in the third quarter was $750 million. Networking represented 59% of our revenue with the storage contributing 37%, driven by growth in 5G and the cloud and the gravity of revenue contribution from our networking business of nearly 60% reached the new record in the third quarter. Revenue from other accounted for 4% of our revenue declining 5% sequentially and 35% year-on-year. As a reminder this business consists of a product we have stopped to investing in. So we expect they will continue to decline over time. Our guidance for the fourth quarter anticipated sequential growth from other, as we expect some customers to complete last time buys on certain components. GAAP gross margin was 50.8%, non- GAAP gross margin was 63% of revenue consistent with our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $390 million, and include the cost for share based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition under divestiture related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $280 million. GAAP operating loss was $9 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $193 million or 25.7% of revenue. For the third quarter GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.03. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.25. Now turning to our balance sheet, during the quarter cash flow from operations was $258 million. In fiscal 2021, we have driven strong free cash flow conversion of 114% of non-GAAP net income on a year-to-date basis. We returned $40 million to shareholders through dividend payments. During the quarter, we paid down $100 million of our term loan and exited the quarter with $832 million in cash and short-term investment and the total debt outstanding of $1.35 billion. We continue to have $500 million of liquidity available from our undrawn revolver. Our net debt to EBITDA ratio was 0.6 on a trailing 12 month basis. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program due to the pending acquisition of Inphi. Before I provide our outlook for the fourth quarter, a remainder on our OpEx patterns. Please note that due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes, our OpEx in the first fiscal quarter tends to increase mid-single digit sequentially on a percentage basis. And this effects then dissipates in the rest of the fiscal year. Here's specific guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. We're forecasting revenue to be in the range of $785 million plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 52.8%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 64%, which anticipates a favorable product mix during the fourth quarter. As we discussed during our Investor Day, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin in the near future to be in the range of 63% to 64%, depending upon the relative mix of a certain 5G and the cloud products in any given quarter. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $379 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $280 million. We expect net interest expense to be approximately $15 million and non-GAAP of tax rate of 5%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be $673 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be $686 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.03 per share on the low end to an income of $0.07 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.25 to $0.33. Please note that our GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using basic weighted average shares outstanding, when there's the a GAAP net loss, and calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding when there's a GAAP net income. Non-GAAP diluted EPS is calculated using diluted weighted average shares outstanding. Operator, please open the lines and announce the Q&A instructions. Thank you."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today\u2019s conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce Vice President of Investor Relations, Ashish Saran.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell\u2019s second quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell\u2019s President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO. I would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our website in the Investor Relations section. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance.\nMatt Murphy: Thanks. Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered strong financial results and achieved $727 million in revenue, $7 million above the midpoint of guidance. Revenue grew 5% sequentially and 11% year over year. Our GAAP loss per share was $0.24. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.21, above the midpoint of guidance, driven by higher revenue, better gross margins, and lower operating expenses. We\u2019re now halfway through our fiscal year, a time period, which has turned out to be very different than we had all imagined, impacted by a global crisis that has significantly disrupted our daily lives and altered our work environment. The Marvell team has met these challenges head-on and has been executing at a very high level. I\u2019m continually impressed by the relentless determination of our engineering teams in the face of a multitude of unprecedented circumstances, like having to manage a chip bring up remotely. I have proudly watched our sales, marketing, and support teams embrace Marvell\u2019s new brand identity and use current circumstances to increase customer engagement. In times of uncertainty, I believe that we benefit significantly in building upon our existing, deep-rooted engagements. When customers make forward-looking platform decisions, their experience with our products and trust in our team works to our advantage. We have continued to close design wins at an impressive rate. While getting a design win is a critical milestone, getting our customers to production and volume ramp is the ultimate goal. To that end, over the last few months, we have received customer approval to move into production several key programs, including a critical SSD controller and a cloud ASIC which are both ramping now, and a 5G baseband processor for Nokia is expected to start ramping later this fiscal year. Let me now provide an update on our process technology platform and our custom ASIC chip strategy. Underpinning the development of all our high-performance storage, networking, compute, and security products is our industry-leading IP portfolio, developed on the leading edge of process technology. Earlier this week, we announced an extension of our long-term collaboration with TSMC, the world\u2019s largest dedicated semiconductor foundry to deliver a comprehensive silicon portfolio leveraging the industry\u2019s most advanced 5-nanometer process technology. This joint development positions Marvell for multigenerational leadership in data infrastructure technology. This accelerated cadence in driving to the latest process node and jumping to 5 nanometers is the outcome of our multiyear evolution to focus on data infrastructure. In the infrastructure market, 5G, cloud, enterprise, and automotive customers are migrating to silicon partners who can solve their most challenging problems, requiring the highest performance to be delivered within a very-tight power budget. This requires access to the latest process technology. The acquisition of Cavium with their processing and compute-heavy portfolio further crystallized the need to change our strategy from a fast follower to a technology leader. The later acquisition of Avera was done with a recognition that our advanced process roadmap would be a significant step up for Avera\u2019s ASIC technology platform and will also increase the volume of projects in advanced geometries with the subsequent benefit to scale across all of Marvell. The leadership position we have established for our process technology platform is the culmination of the last two years of hard work by our central engineering team. This has been a key driver of our recent success in winning sockets in multiple upcoming platforms, such as next generation 5G base stations. Marvell\u2019s 5-nanometer platform solution covers the full spectrum of infrastructure requirements, including high-speed 112 gigabit per second long-reach SerDes processors subsystems, encryption engines, system-on-chip fabrics, chip-to-chip interconnects, and a variety of physical layer interfaces. We have multiple 5-nanometer products in development now on TSMC\u2019s N5P process, an enhanced version of TSMC\u2019s 5-nanometer technology, which delivers higher performance and up to approximately 40% lower power compared to the previous 7-nanometer generation. We expect to start sampling these products by the end of \u201821, with volume production soon thereafter. Our advanced technology is a key enabler of our new custom ASIC platform, which builds upon the Avera acquisition. While customizing silicon is not new to Marvell, this acquisition significantly expanded our capabilities to become a much broader custom silicon supplier. We benefit from Avera\u2019s decades of experience in developing over 2,000 complex full custom ASICs as part of IBM and GlobalFoundries. We believe that access to our more advanced process platform combined with exposure to Marvell\u2019s large customer base opens up a host of new opportunities for the Avera team. Equally important, we are evolving the traditional ASIC model by including all of Marvell\u2019s leading standard product IP into Avera\u2019s custom platform. The breadth of IP we\u2019re offering for customization is what sets us apart. We aren\u2019t just providing high-speed SerDes and other foundational IP, we are also providing highly scalable multi-core ARM processors, Ethernet switches, and controllers, storage controllers and more. This IP can be integrated on chip, or as a companion chip, tightly coupled with advanced system and package solutions. Customers can reuse Marvell\u2019s hardened and widely deployed IP and focus their engineering teams on only the unique aspects of their application, benefiting from faster time to market and lower program risk by using our proven technology. I\u2019m very-pleased to announce that our ASIC team has recently won a major design win under the Marvell umbrella with a Tier 1 hyperscaler. This is a new ASIC account for the Avera team, and we hope that this is the first in a series of design wins with this important customer.  Let me, now provide an update on our server processor strategy. Very much aligned with our growing emphasis on custom solutions, we are evolving our ARM-based server processor efforts towards a custom engagement model. Over the last few years, we have developed multiple generations of ARM server processors and have been working with customers to qualify our products for volume adoption. Our ThunderX2 processor was the industry\u2019s first ARM-based processor, capable of powering dual socket servers, which can go toe-to-toe with x86-based solutions and that has established the performance credentials for ARM in the server market. Hyperscale datacenter customers represent the largest opportunity for ARM server processes. Having worked with them for multiple generations, it has become apparent that the long-term opportunity is for ARM server processors customized to their specific use cases rather than the standard off-the-shelf products. The power of the ARM architecture has always been in its ability to be integrated into highly customized designs optimized for specific use cases, and we see hyperscale datacenter applications is no different. With our breadth of processor knowhow and now our custom ASIC capability, Marvell is uniquely positioned to address this opportunity. A significant amount of unique ARM server processor IP and technology we have developed over the last few years is ideal to create the custom processors hyperscalers are requesting. Therefore, we have decided to target future investments in the ARM server market, exclusively on custom solutions. The business model will be similar to our ASIC and custom programs, where customers contribute engineering and mask expenses to NRE for us to develop and produce products specifically for them. We believe that this is the best way for us to continue to drive the growing adoption of our base compute within the server market. While we continue to invest in a number of initiatives to drive long-term growth, such as advanced process technology, new markets, such as automotive and the launch of our new brand, our team has also remained focused on driving operational excellence. The successful integration of Aquantia and Avera, continued operational discipline, and the change in scope of the ARM server project are collectively driving a significant reduction in our quarterly operating expenses from the current $300 million non-GAAP run rate to the $280 million we are guiding for the third quarter. Our success in customer engagements where we do not need to bear the cost and risk of new product development completely on our own, has also enabled us to manage OpEx tightly, while continuing to invest in advanced technology. The increased willingness of our customers to co-invest with us is truly a testament to the trust and belief they have in our capabilities to provide them with differentiated solutions. Improvements in efficiency and the cost structure of the Company allow us to improve our earnings power, while we continue to invest more in R&D as a percentage of revenue than any other semiconductor company our size. We\u2019re investing heavily because we believe we can grow faster than the industry, and we have the conviction in our strategy to drive long-term growth. However, we remain extremely diligent about how we allocate the Company\u2019s resources. Last week, we held our annual strategic portfolio review, where we deep dive into each of our product lines, evaluate end market dynamics, and review progress against our goals. This review is the cornerstone of our annual business planning process and lays the strategic foundation for everything else. This was our fifth review since I joined Marvell in 2016, and it was by far the best one. It is clear how far we have come over that time period and I could not be more impressed by the quality of our leaders and their depth of experience and technical capabilities. Every year this process informs our capital allocation decisions and has driven a significant improvement in the quality of our businesses over time. I expect this cycle will be no different as we continue to drive long-term success for our employees, customers and investors. Let me now move on to discussing our two businesses in more detail. First, in our networking business, revenue group during the quarter, was $406 million and grew 3% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by ongoing 5G deployments in China. In the cloud data center end market, we started ramping a new custom ship at Tier 1 hyperscaler. A LiquidIO programmable SmartNIC and LiquidSecurity HSMs continued to gain traction at cloud customers, and revenue for these two products more than doubled from the same quarter last year. We are very-pleased with these results which came on the heels of the very strong growth we had delivered in the prior quarter. This is also the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth from the wireless infrastructure market as we benefited from the start of the 5G transition, and our diversified design win position at four of the top five Tier 1 base station OEMs. In addition to the top five global OEMs, there\u2019s also a very accurate next tier of more regionally focused OEMs who are developing their own 5G base station equipment. We believe that our full suite of production-ready 5G silicon solutions, including the industry\u2019s only merchant baseband processor, provide a very compelling path to market for this set of customers. I\u2019m excited to announce we have now secured design wins for our OCTEON embedded processor and our OCTEON Fusion baseband processor with a new 5G customer in this next tier of base station OEMs. We expect this design to serve ramping toward the end of next fiscal year. We continue to engage with this group of customers and look forward to updating you on our progress. We remain on track to start shipping basebands to Nokia and processors customized for massive MIMO applications to Samsung later this year. We believe that OCTEON can continue to improve its position within the large $4 billion market for embedded processors in infrastructure applications. OCTEON has a number of very-compelling advantages, including our process technology platform, multi-core ARM architecture, optimized hardware accelerators, flexible programming model and our ability to customize solutions. Compared to alternative products, our next generation processors, designed on the industry\u2019s most-advanced 5-nanometer process using TSMC\u2019s proven technology platform have become a very attractive solution for customers. We believe that our competitive differentiators will enable us to continue to take share in this large market. Now, shifting gears to our Ethernet portfolio. We\u2019ve been working closely with our customers to design the next generation of Ethernet products tailored to meet some new requirements being placed on networks by mobility and cloud applications, which are extending the boundaries of the traditional enterprise. This quarter, we announced our latest Ethernet solutions for the emerging world of the borderless enterprise. And the borderless enterprise is not just about the transformation of on-campus corporate environments, such as Marvell\u2019s own infrastructure, but also includes new use cases in the rapidly evolving retail, manufacturing, hospitality, finance and education verticals. The number of devices connecting to the network is expanding rapidly. And no matter where the users are physically located, enterprise IT organizations are being asked to deliver a secure high bandwidth experience. Increasing amount of cloud access and remote work need switches with more intelligence, visibility, security and bandwidth. And these requirements are driving the next refresh cycle. As such, switches need to apply intelligent processing right at the edge and offload data to inference engines. The data needs to be encrypted and secure end to end with enhanced network visibility for a seamless experience. The adoption of Wi-Fi 6 is increasing the bandwidth requirements of wired networks. Marvell\u2019s unified Prestera Ethernet switch and Alaska PHY solution set is architected from the ground up to manage this complex and evolving environment. Our advanced telemetry capabilities facilitate network automation and our switches have embedded cryptography based security for Ethernet traffic. Intelligent workload management enables optimized data processing at or near the network access edge, improving the performance of hybrid cloud architectures. Our multi-gig capable switches and PHYs facilitate the transition to 2.5 and 5-gig connectivity, which is essential for Wi-Fi 6 enabled access points and high-performance end devices. Our software development kit enables networking system vendors to easily develop new and differentiated products quickly on our silicon platform. As you may recall, we refreshed our Ethernet portfolio soon after I joined Marvell in 2016. And that led to a sustained period of growth for our switch and PHY businesses, as we took share with our differentiated products that commanded higher gross margins and outgrew the market. This year\u2019s refresh adds an even more impressive set of capabilities and addresses a larger part of the enterprise market, further expanding the access, core and aggregation layers, and we believe that we will continue to drive share gains. In our emerging automotive business, we continue to make progress in expanding the customer base for our Ethernet switch and PHY connectivity products. We have recently closed design wins with 8 new customers, adding to the 16 I have discussed in prior calls. We also continue to see a larger opportunity for us in automotive. Leveraging our growing Ethernet position, we are front and center in discussions around future architectures, and have the opportunity to expand into the adjacent compute, security and storage domains within the connected car. Let me now discuss the outlook for the third fiscal quarter for our networking business. We expect strong growth from the wireless infrastructure and market, driven by multiple customers. We also project growth in the cloud data center market, and we expect our automotive Ethernet products to start shipping in the model year 2021 vehicles, which are starting production now. However, given the softness in the enterprise market driven by COVID-19 and recently telegraphed by multiple customers and peers, not surprisingly, we project demand for our networking products selling into enterprise applications to be weak. The net result is that we expect our overall networking revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 to increase sequentially in the mid to high-single-digits on a percentage basis. Turning now to our storage business. Storage revenue for the second quarter was $290 million, growing 12% sequentially and 6% year-on-year. Strong growth was driven by the start of a ramp of a customized SSD controller for a do-it-yourself or DIY program and easing of COVID-19 production challenges we and our customers experienced in the first quarter. Supply chain improvements benefited both our storage controller and Fibre Channel products. Controller demand from nearline 16 terabyte HDDs was particularly strong. The combination of our product cycles and supply recovery drove our outperformance as compared to the drive market where demand was starting to get impacted from COVID-19. Our pipeline of SSD controller engagements continues to grow, driven by our commitment to deliver the most responsive and best user experience at the lowest power using the most advanced process technology. I\u2019m very-pleased that we have won the next generation of SSD controllers for data center applications at one of our key tier 1 NAND OEMs, extending the multiyear relationship we have with them. This controller features our leadership PCIe Gen5 technology, and we expect to continue to drive long-term growth for our storage business. Looking to the third quarter, we are expecting very different trends between our storage controller and Fibre Channel business. We project our storage controller business, which addresses both, hard disk drives and solid state drive applications to continue to grow sequentially. We expect this growth from the continuation of a ramp of a custom SSD controller partially offset by weaker drive demand from enterprise datacenters and some edge applications such as retail. Stores controllers, shipping into cloud applications are also expected to continue to trend up in third quarter. Conversely, in our Fibre Channel business, we project a significant sequential decline in revenue, resulting from COVID-19-related weakness in enterprise server and storage system demand. The weakness in Fibre Channel is expected to offset the growth from storage controllers. And as a result, we project third quarter consolidated storage revenue to be approximately flat on a sequential basis. In closing, our results continue to validate our strategy to focus on developing the most advanced silicon for data infrastructure. Our portfolio actions have also significantly diversified our end market exposure. And we have a much larger share of revenue today from fast growing 5G wireless and cloud end markets. In 5G, we have wrapped up an impressive set of design wins, which we expect will drive significant revenue growth for us over a number of years. The product ramps at Samsung and particularly Nokia are largely in front of us. In addition to the strong momentum expected from our own product cycles, we\u2019re also turning increasingly positive on the likelihood of our diversified customer base to gain share in light of recent geopolitical events and market dynamics. Cloud has only recently become a larger part of our business, crossing over 10% of our total revenue. In this market with long-term secular growth, we have multiple drivers through our OCTEON processor platform for security products, full custom ASICs, merchant and DIY datacenter SSD controllers, and nearline HCE controllers and prints. In enterprise, while there are near-term headwinds from COVID-19, it is important to keep a longer term perspective that this is a large and diversified worldwide market, spread across a number of industry verticals. The need for secure and intelligent access to bandwidth is not going away, and the number of end points trying to connect to a network are only expanding. We\u2019ve introduced new solutions, specifically designed to address these challenges, and we believe that we can gain share and drive revenue growth from our own product cycles. In our edge end market, we have barely scratched the surface of the current Ethernet and future compute opportunity in autos, which we believe will become another key driver for long-term revenue growth. We have assembled under one roof, a critical mass of scarce and unique IP with a very flexible and customized engagement model, which is proving very attractive to our customers. We\u2019re accelerating our adoption of advanced process technology, which has already started to pay dividends in the form of design wins and new sockets and customers. Our borderless enterprise and ASIC announcements received strong validation from the industry, and we have seen an increase in inbound requests for collaboration from customers, as they become more aware of the depth and breadth of technology at Marvell. We believe that we have built a business for the long haul and are confident in driving revenue growth and managing through any transitional challenges in some of our end markets. We continue to invest in technology, while reducing overall operating expenses by driving higher levels of efficiency with our platform. This operational excellence enhances our ability to deliver operating leverage and drive earnings growth. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nJean Hu: Thanks Matt and good afternoon, everyone. I\u2019ll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue in the second quarter was $727 million, above middle point of our guidance. Networking represents 56% of our revenue in the second quarter with storage contributing 40%. Revenue from other accounted for 4% of revenue, declining 25% sequentially and 41% year-on-year. As a reminder, this business consists of product we have stopped investing in. So, we expect they will continue to decline over time. Our guidance for the third quarter anticipated a small sequential decline in revenue from these products. GAAP gross margin was 49.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.3% of revenue, better than expectations, reflecting the hard work from our operations team to drive operational efficiency to improve our product costs. GAAP operating expenses were $511 million, and they include the cost of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition and divestiture related costs as well as the impairment and other related restructuring charges as a result of the changing scope of the similar processing program Matt discussed earlier in the call. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $297 million, $3 million lower than expected, primarily because of our continued focus on OpEx management. GAAP operating loss was $151 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $163 million or 22.4% of revenue. For the second quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.24. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.21, above the midpoint of the guidance. Now, turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $226 million. Our team continues to drive the improvement of working capital metrics in the second quarter. We improved our days of sales outstanding to 61 days and days of inventory to 90 days. We returned $40 million to shareholders through dividend payments. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program as we believe it\u2019s prudent to further strengthen our liquidity and increase our cash balance during the uncertain environment. We\u2019ll continue to evaluate the business conditions to decide when to restart share repurchase program. We exited the quarter with $832 million in cash and short-term investments, an increase of $164 million from the prior quarter. We continue to have $500 million of liquidity available from our undrawn revolver. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.8 times on a trailing 12-month basis. As of 4th of August 2020, the $450 million term loan is still within 12 months and has been classified as a short-term debt on the balance sheet. We expect our business to continue to generate a strong cash flow, and we intend to repay this amount with the cash flow from operations. I\u2019m pleased that revenue growth combined with our strong business model and operating expense discipline, continue to drive improvement in operating results and strengthening our balance sheet. Now, moving on to our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Please note that compared to second quarter results, our outlook for operating expenses reflect the significant improvement Matt discussed earlier from the successful integration of Aquantia and Avera, continued operational discipline and the change in scope of the ARM server project. As a reminder, our operating expenses can vary quarter-to-quarter, affected by factors such as the number of tape-out within a particular quarter. And these tape-outs are becoming more expensive in newer process geometry. The cadence of an NRE payment, which are primarily treated as contra OpEx can also add variability. And we now have a higher level of NRE following the acquisition of Avera with their customer ASIC model. Due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes, our OpEx in the first fiscal quarter tends to increase sequentially, and this effect then dissipates in the rest of the fiscal year. Here is the specific guidance for the third quarter. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $750 million, plus or minus 5%. We anticipate our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 51.4%, and the non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 63%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $368 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $280 million. We expect net interest expense to be approximately $15 million and expect non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. As a result, we anticipate GAAP results in the range of a loss of $0.04 per diluted share on the low end to an income of $0.04 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.22 to $0.28. Operator, please open the line and announce the Q&A instructions. Thanks.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Nice results, obviously, given the backdrop in enterprise. Matt, I was just kind of curious, you mentioned as you were walking through, you spent a lot of time on ASICs. You mentioned a new design win with hyperscaler. I don\u2019t know if you could give any color with that, but maybe just thinking broader, if you can kind of just give us a flavor as to the types of wins that you mentioned you are picking up in types of segments I think both across wireless and networking, that would be helpful.\nMatt Murphy: So, on the hyperscale win, as I said, we\u2019re pretty excited about that. I think bringing the Avera team into Marvell has created a much more relevant portfolio and broader portfolio for all the hyperscale accounts, and I think it was a great testament to the capability of the team to actually break into a new one. As you know, due to the nature of the ASIC business, these are highly confidential type of engagements that we have, so we can\u2019t go into a ton of detail, but what I would say is that, broadly speaking, our 5-nanometer platform is being extremely well received, both from an ASIC as well as a standard product offering. And what I mean is, when you go out into not only hyperscale, but also the 5G market, and enterprise. We\u2019re migrating the entire Marvell platform across multiple product lines, jumping into 5. So, it\u2019s much broader than just an ASIC engagement. In fact, it\u2019s -- you should assume that our Ethernet business, our OCTEON platform and others are all going to migrate. And so, it\u2019s just created a very rich and compelling set of IPs and engagement model that\u2019s been well received. And so, this is one example of that where we\u2019re actually gaining new customers for new types of technologies. And hopefully, there\u2019ll be more to come on that as we head towards the Investor Day that we just announced in early October to give even more details around our technology platform and the various engagements that we have and talk about them in as much detail as we can at that time, Blayne.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on the good outlook despite all the headwinds. So, Matt, I\u2019m just curious. You mentioned two kinds of headwinds, one because of all the restrictions in terms of shipping to customers in China, and I think separately you also mentioned some headwinds because of COVID and fiber channel. I was hoping if you could address and maybe quantify how much of those headwinds, and I think specifically on the China customer headwinds, do they -- just do those sales just go away? Are some of that recoverable with some license? I\u2019m just curious what is the China exposure now in terms of kind of wired, wireless, and enterprise mix?\nMatt Murphy: Sure, yes. I\u2019ll answer it separately because I think, there are two different dynamics. I think that the China situation obviously is broadly impacting people. And certainly, all of our disclosures, we always call it out as a risk factor just in general. But just to be very clear, in terms of our guidance for the third quarter, there are no China headwinds included in that. So, that was not something that we\u2019re saying is a big part of any headwind we\u2019re seeing there. I mean, it could be minor, but it\u2019s not really material. But, really the central issue in terms of just the growth sequentially, which is still up quarter-over-quarter, certainly would have been better if enterprise had performed maybe where we thought there would have been a few months back, was really around the enterprise market. We saw it in both of our -- both in our networking business, really where we sell Ethernet solutions into things like enterprise campus and SMB, and then also our fiber channel business, which is pretty broadly deployed in a number of enterprise applications, including storage, and that also is projected to be down in the third quarter. And that business, just to note, is generally pretty stable. It doesn\u2019t fluctuate around a whole lot. And so, we definitely are noting it for Q3. So, I would say, ex-those trends in the enterprise very specifically, the rest of the business is obviously performing very well in terms of the strong growth we\u2019re seeing sequentially in our 5G customers, which if you look out to Q3, assuming we achieve what we believe that would be five quarters in a row of quarter-over-quarter growth in that market. And then, in cloud datacenter, again another up quarter after a really strong Q1 and Q2. So that\u2019s really the nature of the headwinds that we\u2019re calling out there. We\u2019re very, very focused on the enterprise set of issues that are out there.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Pitzer: Hey, Matt, Jean. Congratulations on the solid results. Matt, I was wondering if you could just spend a little bit more time on the 5G drivers. I mean, clearly, there\u2019s been some of your peers after several quarters of very strong growth that are kind of characterizing September, October as sort of a digestion period for the 5G wireless CapEx. And I know you\u2019ve got a lot of Company-specific drivers. But, I was hoping you could help me understand what percent of revenue is 5G today? And as you look out into October, what percent might it be? And I guess importantly, how much runway do you have of Company-specific drivers before you become a little bit more dependent upon the overall macro backdrop for spending?\nMatt Murphy: Sure, yes. Great, question, John. And you\u2019re right to note that the performance we\u2019re seeing in that business is really very, very specific to us. And because we didn\u2019t have very large share in 4G, we\u2019re not really seeing that counterbalance that maybe others were -- that are more broadly exposed to both. And then, as you\u2019ve seen, we have new products ramping, we have new OEMs. They\u2019re going into production. We have certainly regionally -- there are regions like China is one example, we called out that is obviously very aggressive in deployment. So, we have a lot of wind at our back in terms of the 5G business. And then, of course, in front of us really is still all the other major geographies, which are projected at various stages to roll out 5G, and then we have new content with new customers also in front of us with Nokia being an example. So, I think, the longer view is it\u2019s going to take us a while, which I think is a good thing, to be at a point where we\u2019ll kind of represent the market. I think, the market needs to develop and 5G would need to be a bigger portion of the total wireless CapEx out there, and then our design wins would have to ramp. So, I think that\u2019s something that we\u2019re -- well, it is a choppy market. We certainly feel like at least at this point, based on our own product cycles and our own design wins that we achieved, that\u2019s why the business is performing that way. And it continues to grow every quarter in terms of revenue as a percent of total, and just as a net amount. And when you think out to the Investor Day, we typically take that opportunity to frame the various markets and our sizes and our shares. And so, sort of look forward to the Investor Day to get a more comprehensive view from a market standpoint of where we are. But, we\u2019re very pleased at the growth rate of that business, similarly to where we were happy with the growth rate of our cloud business and its representation inside the Company. Both of those are working really well for us right now.\nJohn Pitzer: Perfect. Congratulations.\nMatt Murphy: Thanks John. \nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Evercore.\nAshish Saran: Hey, CJ. Are you there? Why don\u2019t we go to the next question, please?\nOperator: Wait for a moment, please. Pardon me. CJ Muse, please check your mute button.\nAshish Saran: Let\u2019s just go to the next question. Operator, can we move to the next question please?\nMatt Murphy: Operator, do you want to just move us to the next person\u2019s question, please?\nJean Hu: Hey, operator, can you just move to the next person\u2019s question?\nAshish Saran: I just got a message. I think, the operator is having technical issues. So, just hang on for a second.\nOperator: Pardon me. This is the conference coordinator. I do show our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the results. Matt, I had a bit of a broader question for you. You talked a lot about 5-nanometer, you talked about custom ASICs. I know recently you talked a lot about edge processing. It just seems like the world is changing right in front of us. And I\u2019m just wondering what that means for Marvell as a company, but perhaps more importantly, for the whole business model because it does seem like we are a bit at an inflection point on all those fronts.\nMatt Murphy: Well, I think you are right. And you certainly look downstream, Tore, in the design chain all the way to the OEMs. And I think the level of digital transformation that\u2019s occurring certainly in companies and in the equipment that needs to get designed to service these new needs is quite dramatic. And so, we\u2019re aware of that. And, I think that really is playing to our advantage, to be honest with you. I think, when you look at what our customer base wants, it\u2019s a unique blend. They want access to the leading edge IP. And maybe that sounds like table stakes, but they have their own very critical applications that they\u2019re trying to serve, and they\u2019re trying to do that in a lot of cases with much higher performance than they ever had to deal with before or much lower power, especially as applications move closer and closer to the edge. And so increasingly as well, the other trend I would note is that the intersection of computing, of networking, security and even storage, these key IPs for the data infrastructure, they\u2019re all tending to blend together in a lot of ways in terms of what customers want to go do. And what that really speaks to is you need to have flexibility in your model in order to service these opportunities. And I think one advantage we have, Tore, at Marvell is that we\u2019ve by design, developed this extremely flexible business model from merchant offerings where customers can prove about our IP because they can just go buy the part to this partner model we innovated, where it\u2019s a combination of our intellectual property and our customers to drive time to market as well as just being able to service this huge opportunity for custom silicon. And so, I think when I look forward, we\u2019re very enthusiastic about all the opportunities in front of us, and also the way that the platform we are really able to leverage. And when I mean platform, I mean, our design win platform, our technology platform where we don\u2019t have a lot of random adjacent businesses. What we do for a living is we do this data infrastructure silicon really, really well, and we do that in a very concentrated manner. And you see that both in our -- now our 5-nanometer platform, which we announced this week with TSMC and the translation of all that investment and the focus we have actually, surprisingly, even driving lower operating expenses than we had before. So I think it\u2019s a unique combination. And Tore, I would just say you nailed it. There is a big opportunity for Marvell on the go-forward here.\nOperator: I show our next question comes from Karl Ackerman from Cowen. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Jean, it\u2019s great to see the solid execution on OpEx. I\u2019m curious, though, what\u2019s the argument for OpEx to not trend toward 30%, even if we assume flattish revenue from here, particularly given the maturity of the storage TAM and the co-investment from customers for processors? Thank you.\nJean Hu: Yes. First, we\u2019re really pleased that our team has done a great job to reduce the OpEx to $280 million quarterly run rate versus our original expectation. It\u2019s more like a $300 million when we entered into fiscal \u201821. So that\u2019s just a tremendous effort by realizing more synergies from Avera and Aquantia integration and also just operational efficiency across the board. So, if you think about that, we\u2019re investing in the right level and with our portfolio adjustment, the portfolio optimization, we constantly review as a company. We do see actually driving the revenue ramp. If you look at our Q3 guide, it implies revenue year-over-year growth of double digit. And the continued revenue ramp with the current operating expense level, we do think our model are going to show tremendous leverage and continue to drive the earnings expansion. If you look at our Q3 guide, the operating margin at the middle point of our guidance actually is close to 26%. So, I think we are setting up a great business model with the OpEx level to invest and to continue to expand.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from Quinn Bolton from Needham.\nMichelle Waller: Hi, guys. This is Michelle on for Quinn. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on the results. So, my question is on the storage business. I know you guys don\u2019t break out the storage controllers from Fibre Channel. But, I was wondering if you can give some color on how the 2 segments are broken up within that bucket. So, I\u2019m just trying to figure out like the puts and takes for the Fibre Channel decline and trying to determine kind of like the magnitude.\nJean Hu: Hi. Michelle, I\u2019ll help you give you some color. We typically don\u2019t give all the details and report all the details. But to help you out, the way to think about it is Fibre Channel business, the overall market opportunity of SAM is about $500 million each year. It\u2019s quite a stable market. Actually, it\u2019s a split between Marvell and Broadcom. So, largely, we are very much similar size. And so, if you think about our Fibre Channel business, it\u2019s all selling into the enterprise data center on-premise. So, current weakness certainly impacts it tremendously. Sequentially, the revenue declined actually to 20% quarter-over-quarter. So, it\u2019s quite significant. Hopefully, that will give you some color. But we don\u2019t break down the details within the storage category generally.\nOperator: Thank you. I show our next question comes from Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nGary Mobley: I wanted to dig a little bit deeper into the ThunderX ARM-based service development. And so, to what extent was that $121 million charge related to the restructuring development of Thunder? And how does it impact your joint development, I guess, cost-sharing relationship with ARM and as well the related option for them to take some Marvell equity? And then, the ThunderX3 that you highlighted at Hot Chips last week, is that -- should we think about that as being funded by maybe one or two specific customers?\nJean Hu: So Gary, we\u2019ll divide this question in two pieces. I\u2019ll answer the impairment part, then Matt can talk about the strategic side of the ARM business. So, the impairment actually is quite straightforward. As you recall, we acquired Cavium, and we closed the transaction two years ago. So, there\u2019s a very small piece of developed technology intangible related to all the TX2 Cavium developed before the acquisition of Marvell acquired Cavium. So, that\u2019s primarily, if you look at the impairment, the primary impairment is related the intangible developed technology of TX2, how Cavium did that business in the past. With our new focus going forward, definitely, those all the development technology intangible is going to be impaired. That\u2019s the impairment part of it. I\u2019ll let Matt answer the strategic side of the ARM server business.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes. Hey, Gary. So, I think at the highest level, and you know this well, we\u2019ve had a long-term history with ARM. They\u2019re used in almost all of our products, and we cooperate on a number of different applications, like the ARM server opportunity to 5G, automotive, et cetera. So, two companies work together. And the way you should think about, again, what we\u2019re doing with the Thunder product line is really just focusing it. The market that we\u2019ve always called out for this has always been the hyperscale customers. And so, what we\u2019re basically doing is just really acknowledging that and also acknowledging the fact that it turns out they seem to really want their own thing, their own special chip. And this notion of maybe if you go back a few years to where you would have a broad-based ARM server platform that you would drive and you could sell to everybody and maybe put it on like a TikTok type of cadence and sort of run it like a normal CPU business. I think just so much has changed since we acquired Cavium and this market\u2019s developed. ARM in the data center and ARM in servers has actually continued to get traction in the market, whether that\u2019s with us or that\u2019s with customers doing their own developments themselves in-house with partners. And so we expect that to continue. We\u2019re just going to do this in a much more focused and targeted manner and with a business model that looks more like our traditional customer semi-custom model versus funding the whole thing on our own kind of in perpetuity. We\u2019ve said basically, -- we think it\u2019s more -- it\u2019s better for us and better for the customers actually to do this in a more focused manner. I hope that helps.\nOperator: And our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JP Morgan.\nHarlan Sur: Hey. Good afternoon. And good job on the quarterly execution. Good to see the diversification in the storage business driving flattish growth in what I would consider to be a very tough storage environment. You guys have been talking about the ramp of your DIY SSD controller into the large gaming opportunity. That\u2019s starting to fire and looks to be pretty strong here in the second half. But, even on the HDD side, I believe that your second nearline HDD customer just got qualified on its 16-terabyte platform and is ramping here in the September quarter. Are you guys benefiting from this ramp here in Q3? And maybe mid to longer term, you guys also have some DIY SSD controller wins with Tier 1 hyperscalers. When do you guys expect these programs to ramp?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Great questions, Harlan. And I think, yes, if you think about the storage business, the storage controller portion is performing quite well into Q3. As Jean sort of laid the breadcrumbs earlier on the Fibre Channel business, how to think about that market size, our share of it, how much it was down, we\u2019re basically offsetting that by growth in the -- both the SSD side, and to your point, in our custom SSD engagement as well as in both of our nearline customers that continue to ramp with our solutions of SOCs and then one also using our preamplifier solution as well. So yes, the traditional, call it, Marvell storage controller business is performing quite well in the near-term here coming off of the lows through the COVID-19, supply issues that were going on. So, that\u2019s doing well. It\u2019s really this very-targeted slowdown in enterprise we\u2019re seeing within the storage areas offsetting that growth. So, the growth drivers are very much working in storage is what I would say, the areas where we put a lot of R&D and investment in cloud applications as well as in DIY. It\u2019s nice to see the revenue coming in. And I think there\u2019s more to come on discussions of future DIY engagements, which we\u2019re very active in right now. Some of those have already turned into design wins with hyperscalers, and that is also part of our future growth strategy. To continue to keep storage growing is expanding with additional customers that we didn\u2019t have before. So, more on that later.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri: Matt, I think you alluded to a design win with another 5G base station customer beyond the two that we already know about. Can you talk a little more about that and maybe help size the content for that win maybe versus the two that you\u2019ve already talked about?\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes. I think, yes, so there was a lot of content we went through today. But the main point was that while there\u2019s a lot made certainly of the top five vendors, in the base station market -- and typically, those five are, call it, 90% of the total. So, it\u2019s a big number historically. But there\u2019s also a -- the remainder is currently quite active in this 5G transition. And I would say in almost every region, whether it\u2019s in parts of Asia, certainly North America and other geos, there is a lot of activity there in what we would call the second tier. And the nice thing is, is that the products that we develop for the top -- call the top guys, those are all going to be available as standard products for the rest of the market. And so, for example, the win that we got that\u2019s in the second tier, it\u2019s using the existing parts we already have. So obviously, a lot of leverage from that because we didn\u2019t have to go and design a brand new chip and spend a bunch of money on it, and they are able to leverage the investment that we already made. And without getting into dollars, what we did say is that the content is both the Fusion baseband, and you guys have a sense of what those go for, as well as our OCTEON embedded processor for the transport and layer 2 processing. So, we have very solid content from a processing perspective there. And I would say is, with -- the last thing, Tim, is with all the disruption going on in all the geopolitical events, I think there\u2019s an opportunity for this second tier to actually become more relevant in 5G, whether it\u2019s taking share from traditional incumbents or even with new standards like ORAN, where you might see new people come in and actually the meaningful participants in some of the regions. So, that\u2019s -- again, that\u2019s one that we\u2019re watching. But, it\u2019s nice that we\u2019re able to take kind of benefit from all the hard work we\u2019ve done to put these IP platforms together, to be able to then go in and sell those and enable other customers of ours to participate in 5G market.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore: Matt, I want to go back to the enterprise side. I think, everybody understands that the demand is weak right now. It\u2019s nothing Marvell specific. But, I wanted to dig a little bit into your views of the duration of that weakness and some of the sub causes of it. So in the past, we\u2019ve seen the macro demand weaken and there also be some significant inventory burn that exacerbated that for a period of time. So, I guess the two parts of this question would be, is your fiscal third quarter enterprise guidance being weak, exacerbated by that inventory digestion, and do you think that continues into your fiscal fourth quarter? And similarly, are there Company-specific offsets either share gains or losses within enterprise that would be either offset or magnify that weakness?\nMatt Murphy: Sure, Ross. Yes. I\u2019d say, certainly, in the short term, we\u2019re seeing the impacts you said. And I think some of this may be certainly inventory related. I do think that when we had the supply crunch and countries we\u2019re shutting down left and right, I think certainly, OEMs wanted to make sure that they have some inventory. But, I would say that is also very much coupled depending on the segment you\u2019re talking about with just straight up demand weakness just given that certain segments of enterprise companies aren\u2019t spending on. And I think those are very well known. So -- but I\u2019d say that the inventory part, unlike sort of, I\u2019d say prior cycles, which I\u2019ve been through, I\u2019d say this one is just more on the demand side at this point. So that\u2019s really in the short term, and we just have to deal with that. We\u2019re still very encouraged, okay, and bullish about our enterprise offerings, once we\u2019re through this cycle we\u2019re in, especially as we look out to calendar \u201821. And I referenced in my remarks as well as you probably saw some of the announcements we made around our borderless enterprise. I mean, that whole thing is really code for Marvell just refreshed its entire Ethernet switching and PHY portfolio. And the last time we did that, which was a few years ago, we jumped a process node or 2 at that time. We added a whole bunch of features. We optimized the products. And we had great success. It was part of the kind of the initial Marvell turnaround story was that networking growth. And so, we see the same type of opportunity starting really next year with some of our new products, which are, again, in the latest process nodes that are relevant for those markets, the latest sets of features. And then, even beyond that, as we look out, I\u2019d say, beyond next year and you start looking at our 5-nanometer portfolio, which we\u2019re sampling our first products next year on, but all the design wins that we\u2019re in the hunt on right now are really in that node for the large sockets. We\u2019re extremely well positioned. And I would say that even goes beyond Ethernet, and also looking out to our next-generation OCTEON products, which have gotten a lot of press because of their success in base stations recently. But don\u2019t forget about the wired market. And the wired market, I think, if you look at all the networking OEMs and communication OEMs and what they\u2019re going to need in the future and you look at us with a best-in-class infrastructure processor in 5-nanometer, which would be the 10th generation Cavium processor, we\u2019re very excited about that business between -- on a number of fronts. So I think the shorter term, we certainly have some chop. Fortunately, it\u2019s being offset by cloud and 5G. But we\u2019re still very optimistic on enterprise, which drives great margins for the Company, great stickiness. And I think, we\u2019ll benefit from the hard work the team has put in to really refresh the portfolio. We\u2019re seeing great traction on those products.\nOperator: Thank you. And the last question we\u2019ll take comes from Srini Pajjuri with SMB.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. Jean, I have a question on the cash usage. I saw that the share count has perked up a little bit in the quarter. Just wondering how you are thinking about the cash usage as we go into the next few quarters? And maybe along the same lines, Matt, you guys have done a great job with M&A, integrating some of the acquisitions. And now that the cash flow is improving, the balance sheet is pretty strong. I\u2019m just curious as to how you\u2019re thinking about M&A for the next 12 months, what do you see out there in the market? What kind of opportunities you\u2019re seeing and how you\u2019re thinking about it?\nJean Hu: Yes. So, on the cash usage for the next few quarters, certainly, our business will continue to generate a very strong free cash flow. If you look at the first half of fiscal year 2021, our cash flow conversion is very significantly higher than the -- more than 100% of our net income. So, I think certainly, we\u2019re going to be able to pay down our short-term debt, which is $450 million. And the additional excess cash, we have always been quite committed to return cash to shareholders. Certainly, the macro environment is still uncertain, but we definitely will monitor and assess, if we should restart the share repurchase program. So, that\u2019s definitely what we are considering.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. And I\u2019ll just conclude on the second topic you mentioned about M&A. So, yes, I think we\u2019re -- first of all, we\u2019re very pleased with how all the effort we put in, in 2019. We bid off a lot, as you remember. We sold our Wi-Fi business to NXP, and then, we purchased Aquantia and Avera. And we made those decisions candidly right kind of in the midst of trade war and a lot of uncertainty. And I think reflecting back, we\u2019re thrilled that we made those decisions. I think, both of those acquisitions we did last year were performing better than we had anticipated when we announced them. As you saw from our results, I think, the benefit of the Marvell platform from a cost standpoint has really enabled us to run these 2 businesses that we acquired, very efficiently, while keeping key technical talent and key management talent, which we were thrilled to get. And so, we like those kind of deals. I think the prices paid were very reasonable. And certainly, they\u2019ve really helped our Company. And so, look, we\u2019re in execution mode at this point. We got a lot of design wins in front of us. We\u2019re executing a 5-nanometer platform. But, we\u2019re always going to keep a look out and certainly very encouraged by the guidance we gave in terms of revenue growth. But also, if you even look at last quarter, it was the cash flow generation of the Company. I think you\u2019re starting to see that the Company has got a tremendous leverage in its operating model and can generate significant free cash flow as we grow, and that certainly sets us up well if we were to find opportunities to go after. But, as you know, we\u2019ve been very-disciplined on this front. Multiples are definitely high at this point. We\u2019ve got a lot going on. So, of course, we\u2019ll look around. But right now, I know myself and the team are plenty busy with executing our current initiatives that we\u2019ve worked really hard to put together. But, we will see. Thank, Srini.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. And you may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Murphy",
            "content": "Thanks. Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. During the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we delivered strong financial results and achieved $727 million in revenue, $7 million above the midpoint of guidance. Revenue grew 5% sequentially and 11% year over year. Our GAAP loss per share was $0.24. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.21, above the midpoint of guidance, driven by higher revenue, better gross margins, and lower operating expenses. We're now halfway through our fiscal year, a time period, which has turned out to be very different than we had all imagined, impacted by a global crisis that has significantly disrupted our daily lives and altered our work environment. The Marvell team has met these challenges head-on and has been executing at a very high level. I'm continually impressed by the relentless determination of our engineering teams in the face of a multitude of unprecedented circumstances, like having to manage a chip bring up remotely. I have proudly watched our sales, marketing, and support teams embrace Marvell's new brand identity and use current circumstances to increase customer engagement. In times of uncertainty, I believe that we benefit significantly in building upon our existing, deep-rooted engagements. When customers make forward-looking platform decisions, their experience with our products and trust in our team works to our advantage. We have continued to close design wins at an impressive rate. While getting a design win is a critical milestone, getting our customers to production and volume ramp is the ultimate goal. To that end, over the last few months, we have received customer approval to move into production several key programs, including a critical SSD controller and a cloud ASIC which are both ramping now, and a 5G baseband processor for Nokia is expected to start ramping later this fiscal year. Let me now provide an update on our process technology platform and our custom ASIC chip strategy. Underpinning the development of all our high-performance storage, networking, compute, and security products is our industry-leading IP portfolio, developed on the leading edge of process technology. Earlier this week, we announced an extension of our long-term collaboration with TSMC, the world's largest dedicated semiconductor foundry to deliver a comprehensive silicon portfolio leveraging the industry's most advanced 5-nanometer process technology. This joint development positions Marvell for multigenerational leadership in data infrastructure technology. This accelerated cadence in driving to the latest process node and jumping to 5 nanometers is the outcome of our multiyear evolution to focus on data infrastructure. In the infrastructure market, 5G, cloud, enterprise, and automotive customers are migrating to silicon partners who can solve their most challenging problems, requiring the highest performance to be delivered within a very-tight power budget. This requires access to the latest process technology. The acquisition of Cavium with their processing and compute-heavy portfolio further crystallized the need to change our strategy from a fast follower to a technology leader. The later acquisition of Avera was done with a recognition that our advanced process roadmap would be a significant step up for Avera's ASIC technology platform and will also increase the volume of projects in advanced geometries with the subsequent benefit to scale across all of Marvell. The leadership position we have established for our process technology platform is the culmination of the last two years of hard work by our central engineering team. This has been a key driver of our recent success in winning sockets in multiple upcoming platforms, such as next generation 5G base stations. Marvell's 5-nanometer platform solution covers the full spectrum of infrastructure requirements, including high-speed 112 gigabit per second long-reach SerDes processors subsystems, encryption engines, system-on-chip fabrics, chip-to-chip interconnects, and a variety of physical layer interfaces. We have multiple 5-nanometer products in development now on TSMC's N5P process, an enhanced version of TSMC's 5-nanometer technology, which delivers higher performance and up to approximately 40% lower power compared to the previous 7-nanometer generation. We expect to start sampling these products by the end of \u201821, with volume production soon thereafter. Our advanced technology is a key enabler of our new custom ASIC platform, which builds upon the Avera acquisition. While customizing silicon is not new to Marvell, this acquisition significantly expanded our capabilities to become a much broader custom silicon supplier. We benefit from Avera's decades of experience in developing over 2,000 complex full custom ASICs as part of IBM and GlobalFoundries. We believe that access to our more advanced process platform combined with exposure to Marvell's large customer base opens up a host of new opportunities for the Avera team. Equally important, we are evolving the traditional ASIC model by including all of Marvell's leading standard product IP into Avera's custom platform. The breadth of IP we're offering for customization is what sets us apart. We aren't just providing high-speed SerDes and other foundational IP, we are also providing highly scalable multi-core ARM processors, Ethernet switches, and controllers, storage controllers and more. This IP can be integrated on chip, or as a companion chip, tightly coupled with advanced system and package solutions. Customers can reuse Marvell's hardened and widely deployed IP and focus their engineering teams on only the unique aspects of their application, benefiting from faster time to market and lower program risk by using our proven technology. I'm very-pleased to announce that our ASIC team has recently won a major design win under the Marvell umbrella with a Tier 1 hyperscaler. This is a new ASIC account for the Avera team, and we hope that this is the first in a series of design wins with this important customer.  Let me, now provide an update on our server processor strategy. Very much aligned with our growing emphasis on custom solutions, we are evolving our ARM-based server processor efforts towards a custom engagement model. Over the last few years, we have developed multiple generations of ARM server processors and have been working with customers to qualify our products for volume adoption. Our ThunderX2 processor was the industry's first ARM-based processor, capable of powering dual socket servers, which can go toe-to-toe with x86-based solutions and that has established the performance credentials for ARM in the server market. Hyperscale datacenter customers represent the largest opportunity for ARM server processes. Having worked with them for multiple generations, it has become apparent that the long-term opportunity is for ARM server processors customized to their specific use cases rather than the standard off-the-shelf products. The power of the ARM architecture has always been in its ability to be integrated into highly customized designs optimized for specific use cases, and we see hyperscale datacenter applications is no different. With our breadth of processor knowhow and now our custom ASIC capability, Marvell is uniquely positioned to address this opportunity. A significant amount of unique ARM server processor IP and technology we have developed over the last few years is ideal to create the custom processors hyperscalers are requesting. Therefore, we have decided to target future investments in the ARM server market, exclusively on custom solutions. The business model will be similar to our ASIC and custom programs, where customers contribute engineering and mask expenses to NRE for us to develop and produce products specifically for them. We believe that this is the best way for us to continue to drive the growing adoption of our base compute within the server market. While we continue to invest in a number of initiatives to drive long-term growth, such as advanced process technology, new markets, such as automotive and the launch of our new brand, our team has also remained focused on driving operational excellence. The successful integration of Aquantia and Avera, continued operational discipline, and the change in scope of the ARM server project are collectively driving a significant reduction in our quarterly operating expenses from the current $300 million non-GAAP run rate to the $280 million we are guiding for the third quarter. Our success in customer engagements where we do not need to bear the cost and risk of new product development completely on our own, has also enabled us to manage OpEx tightly, while continuing to invest in advanced technology. The increased willingness of our customers to co-invest with us is truly a testament to the trust and belief they have in our capabilities to provide them with differentiated solutions. Improvements in efficiency and the cost structure of the Company allow us to improve our earnings power, while we continue to invest more in R&D as a percentage of revenue than any other semiconductor company our size. We're investing heavily because we believe we can grow faster than the industry, and we have the conviction in our strategy to drive long-term growth. However, we remain extremely diligent about how we allocate the Company's resources. Last week, we held our annual strategic portfolio review, where we deep dive into each of our product lines, evaluate end market dynamics, and review progress against our goals. This review is the cornerstone of our annual business planning process and lays the strategic foundation for everything else. This was our fifth review since I joined Marvell in 2016, and it was by far the best one. It is clear how far we have come over that time period and I could not be more impressed by the quality of our leaders and their depth of experience and technical capabilities. Every year this process informs our capital allocation decisions and has driven a significant improvement in the quality of our businesses over time. I expect this cycle will be no different as we continue to drive long-term success for our employees, customers and investors. Let me now move on to discussing our two businesses in more detail. First, in our networking business, revenue group during the quarter, was $406 million and grew 3% sequentially and 23% year-over-year. Growth was driven primarily by ongoing 5G deployments in China. In the cloud data center end market, we started ramping a new custom ship at Tier 1 hyperscaler. A LiquidIO programmable SmartNIC and LiquidSecurity HSMs continued to gain traction at cloud customers, and revenue for these two products more than doubled from the same quarter last year. We are very-pleased with these results which came on the heels of the very strong growth we had delivered in the prior quarter. This is also the fourth consecutive quarter of sequential revenue growth from the wireless infrastructure market as we benefited from the start of the 5G transition, and our diversified design win position at four of the top five Tier 1 base station OEMs. In addition to the top five global OEMs, there's also a very accurate next tier of more regionally focused OEMs who are developing their own 5G base station equipment. We believe that our full suite of production-ready 5G silicon solutions, including the industry's only merchant baseband processor, provide a very compelling path to market for this set of customers. I'm excited to announce we have now secured design wins for our OCTEON embedded processor and our OCTEON Fusion baseband processor with a new 5G customer in this next tier of base station OEMs. We expect this design to serve ramping toward the end of next fiscal year. We continue to engage with this group of customers and look forward to updating you on our progress. We remain on track to start shipping basebands to Nokia and processors customized for massive MIMO applications to Samsung later this year. We believe that OCTEON can continue to improve its position within the large $4 billion market for embedded processors in infrastructure applications. OCTEON has a number of very-compelling advantages, including our process technology platform, multi-core ARM architecture, optimized hardware accelerators, flexible programming model and our ability to customize solutions. Compared to alternative products, our next generation processors, designed on the industry's most-advanced 5-nanometer process using TSMC's proven technology platform have become a very attractive solution for customers. We believe that our competitive differentiators will enable us to continue to take share in this large market. Now, shifting gears to our Ethernet portfolio. We've been working closely with our customers to design the next generation of Ethernet products tailored to meet some new requirements being placed on networks by mobility and cloud applications, which are extending the boundaries of the traditional enterprise. This quarter, we announced our latest Ethernet solutions for the emerging world of the borderless enterprise. And the borderless enterprise is not just about the transformation of on-campus corporate environments, such as Marvell's own infrastructure, but also includes new use cases in the rapidly evolving retail, manufacturing, hospitality, finance and education verticals. The number of devices connecting to the network is expanding rapidly. And no matter where the users are physically located, enterprise IT organizations are being asked to deliver a secure high bandwidth experience. Increasing amount of cloud access and remote work need switches with more intelligence, visibility, security and bandwidth. And these requirements are driving the next refresh cycle. As such, switches need to apply intelligent processing right at the edge and offload data to inference engines. The data needs to be encrypted and secure end to end with enhanced network visibility for a seamless experience. The adoption of Wi-Fi 6 is increasing the bandwidth requirements of wired networks. Marvell's unified Prestera Ethernet switch and Alaska PHY solution set is architected from the ground up to manage this complex and evolving environment. Our advanced telemetry capabilities facilitate network automation and our switches have embedded cryptography based security for Ethernet traffic. Intelligent workload management enables optimized data processing at or near the network access edge, improving the performance of hybrid cloud architectures. Our multi-gig capable switches and PHYs facilitate the transition to 2.5 and 5-gig connectivity, which is essential for Wi-Fi 6 enabled access points and high-performance end devices. Our software development kit enables networking system vendors to easily develop new and differentiated products quickly on our silicon platform. As you may recall, we refreshed our Ethernet portfolio soon after I joined Marvell in 2016. And that led to a sustained period of growth for our switch and PHY businesses, as we took share with our differentiated products that commanded higher gross margins and outgrew the market. This year's refresh adds an even more impressive set of capabilities and addresses a larger part of the enterprise market, further expanding the access, core and aggregation layers, and we believe that we will continue to drive share gains. In our emerging automotive business, we continue to make progress in expanding the customer base for our Ethernet switch and PHY connectivity products. We have recently closed design wins with 8 new customers, adding to the 16 I have discussed in prior calls. We also continue to see a larger opportunity for us in automotive. Leveraging our growing Ethernet position, we are front and center in discussions around future architectures, and have the opportunity to expand into the adjacent compute, security and storage domains within the connected car. Let me now discuss the outlook for the third fiscal quarter for our networking business. We expect strong growth from the wireless infrastructure and market, driven by multiple customers. We also project growth in the cloud data center market, and we expect our automotive Ethernet products to start shipping in the model year 2021 vehicles, which are starting production now. However, given the softness in the enterprise market driven by COVID-19 and recently telegraphed by multiple customers and peers, not surprisingly, we project demand for our networking products selling into enterprise applications to be weak. The net result is that we expect our overall networking revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2021 to increase sequentially in the mid to high-single-digits on a percentage basis. Turning now to our storage business. Storage revenue for the second quarter was $290 million, growing 12% sequentially and 6% year-on-year. Strong growth was driven by the start of a ramp of a customized SSD controller for a do-it-yourself or DIY program and easing of COVID-19 production challenges we and our customers experienced in the first quarter. Supply chain improvements benefited both our storage controller and Fibre Channel products. Controller demand from nearline 16 terabyte HDDs was particularly strong. The combination of our product cycles and supply recovery drove our outperformance as compared to the drive market where demand was starting to get impacted from COVID-19. Our pipeline of SSD controller engagements continues to grow, driven by our commitment to deliver the most responsive and best user experience at the lowest power using the most advanced process technology. I'm very-pleased that we have won the next generation of SSD controllers for data center applications at one of our key tier 1 NAND OEMs, extending the multiyear relationship we have with them. This controller features our leadership PCIe Gen5 technology, and we expect to continue to drive long-term growth for our storage business. Looking to the third quarter, we are expecting very different trends between our storage controller and Fibre Channel business. We project our storage controller business, which addresses both, hard disk drives and solid state drive applications to continue to grow sequentially. We expect this growth from the continuation of a ramp of a custom SSD controller partially offset by weaker drive demand from enterprise datacenters and some edge applications such as retail. Stores controllers, shipping into cloud applications are also expected to continue to trend up in third quarter. Conversely, in our Fibre Channel business, we project a significant sequential decline in revenue, resulting from COVID-19-related weakness in enterprise server and storage system demand. The weakness in Fibre Channel is expected to offset the growth from storage controllers. And as a result, we project third quarter consolidated storage revenue to be approximately flat on a sequential basis. In closing, our results continue to validate our strategy to focus on developing the most advanced silicon for data infrastructure. Our portfolio actions have also significantly diversified our end market exposure. And we have a much larger share of revenue today from fast growing 5G wireless and cloud end markets. In 5G, we have wrapped up an impressive set of design wins, which we expect will drive significant revenue growth for us over a number of years. The product ramps at Samsung and particularly Nokia are largely in front of us. In addition to the strong momentum expected from our own product cycles, we're also turning increasingly positive on the likelihood of our diversified customer base to gain share in light of recent geopolitical events and market dynamics. Cloud has only recently become a larger part of our business, crossing over 10% of our total revenue. In this market with long-term secular growth, we have multiple drivers through our OCTEON processor platform for security products, full custom ASICs, merchant and DIY datacenter SSD controllers, and nearline HCE controllers and prints. In enterprise, while there are near-term headwinds from COVID-19, it is important to keep a longer term perspective that this is a large and diversified worldwide market, spread across a number of industry verticals. The need for secure and intelligent access to bandwidth is not going away, and the number of end points trying to connect to a network are only expanding. We've introduced new solutions, specifically designed to address these challenges, and we believe that we can gain share and drive revenue growth from our own product cycles. In our edge end market, we have barely scratched the surface of the current Ethernet and future compute opportunity in autos, which we believe will become another key driver for long-term revenue growth. We have assembled under one roof, a critical mass of scarce and unique IP with a very flexible and customized engagement model, which is proving very attractive to our customers. We're accelerating our adoption of advanced process technology, which has already started to pay dividends in the form of design wins and new sockets and customers. Our borderless enterprise and ASIC announcements received strong validation from the industry, and we have seen an increase in inbound requests for collaboration from customers, as they become more aware of the depth and breadth of technology at Marvell. We believe that we have built a business for the long haul and are confident in driving revenue growth and managing through any transitional challenges in some of our end markets. We continue to invest in technology, while reducing overall operating expenses by driving higher levels of efficiency with our platform. This operational excellence enhances our ability to deliver operating leverage and drive earnings growth. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. So, on the hyperscale win, as I said, we're pretty excited about that. I think bringing the Avera team into Marvell has created a much more relevant portfolio and broader portfolio for all the hyperscale accounts, and I think it was a great testament to the capability of the team to actually break into a new one. As you know, due to the nature of the ASIC business, these are highly confidential type of engagements that we have, so we can't go into a ton of detail, but what I would say is that, broadly speaking, our 5-nanometer platform is being extremely well received, both from an ASIC as well as a standard product offering. And what I mean is, when you go out into not only hyperscale, but also the 5G market, and enterprise. We're migrating the entire Marvell platform across multiple product lines, jumping into 5. So, it's much broader than just an ASIC engagement. In fact, it's -- you should assume that our Ethernet business, our OCTEON platform and others are all going to migrate. And so, it's just created a very rich and compelling set of IPs and engagement model that's been well received. And so, this is one example of that where we're actually gaining new customers for new types of technologies. And hopefully, there'll be more to come on that as we head towards the Investor Day that we just announced in early October to give even more details around our technology platform and the various engagements that we have and talk about them in as much detail as we can at that time, Blayne. Sure, yes. I'll answer it separately because I think, there are two different dynamics. I think that the China situation obviously is broadly impacting people. And certainly, all of our disclosures, we always call it out as a risk factor just in general. But just to be very clear, in terms of our guidance for the third quarter, there are no China headwinds included in that. So, that was not something that we're saying is a big part of any headwind we're seeing there. I mean, it could be minor, but it's not really material. But, really the central issue in terms of just the growth sequentially, which is still up quarter-over-quarter, certainly would have been better if enterprise had performed maybe where we thought there would have been a few months back, was really around the enterprise market. We saw it in both of our -- both in our networking business, really where we sell Ethernet solutions into things like enterprise campus and SMB, and then also our fiber channel business, which is pretty broadly deployed in a number of enterprise applications, including storage, and that also is projected to be down in the third quarter. And that business, just to note, is generally pretty stable. It doesn't fluctuate around a whole lot. And so, we definitely are noting it for Q3. So, I would say, ex-those trends in the enterprise very specifically, the rest of the business is obviously performing very well in terms of the strong growth we're seeing sequentially in our 5G customers, which if you look out to Q3, assuming we achieve what we believe that would be five quarters in a row of quarter-over-quarter growth in that market. And then, in cloud datacenter, again another up quarter after a really strong Q1 and Q2. So that's really the nature of the headwinds that we're calling out there. We're very, very focused on the enterprise set of issues that are out there. Sure. Sure, yes. Great, question, John. And you're right to note that the performance we're seeing in that business is really very, very specific to us. And because we didn't have very large share in 4G, we're not really seeing that counterbalance that maybe others were -- that are more broadly exposed to both. And then, as you've seen, we have new products ramping, we have new OEMs. They're going into production. We have certainly regionally -- there are regions like China is one example, we called out that is obviously very aggressive in deployment. So, we have a lot of wind at our back in terms of the 5G business. And then, of course, in front of us really is still all the other major geographies, which are projected at various stages to roll out 5G, and then we have new content with new customers also in front of us with Nokia being an example. So, I think, the longer view is it's going to take us a while, which I think is a good thing, to be at a point where we'll kind of represent the market. I think, the market needs to develop and 5G would need to be a bigger portion of the total wireless CapEx out there, and then our design wins would have to ramp. So, I think that's something that we're -- well, it is a choppy market. We certainly feel like at least at this point, based on our own product cycles and our own design wins that we achieved, that's why the business is performing that way. And it continues to grow every quarter in terms of revenue as a percent of total, and just as a net amount. And when you think out to the Investor Day, we typically take that opportunity to frame the various markets and our sizes and our shares. And so, sort of look forward to the Investor Day to get a more comprehensive view from a market standpoint of where we are. But, we're very pleased at the growth rate of that business, similarly to where we were happy with the growth rate of our cloud business and its representation inside the Company. Both of those are working really well for us right now. Thanks John. Operator, do you want to just move us to the next person's question, please? Well, I think you are right. And you certainly look downstream, Tore, in the design chain all the way to the OEMs. And I think the level of digital transformation that's occurring certainly in companies and in the equipment that needs to get designed to service these new needs is quite dramatic. And so, we're aware of that. And, I think that really is playing to our advantage, to be honest with you. I think, when you look at what our customer base wants, it's a unique blend. They want access to the leading edge IP. And maybe that sounds like table stakes, but they have their own very critical applications that they're trying to serve, and they're trying to do that in a lot of cases with much higher performance than they ever had to deal with before or much lower power, especially as applications move closer and closer to the edge. And so increasingly as well, the other trend I would note is that the intersection of computing, of networking, security and even storage, these key IPs for the data infrastructure, they're all tending to blend together in a lot of ways in terms of what customers want to go do. And what that really speaks to is you need to have flexibility in your model in order to service these opportunities. And I think one advantage we have, Tore, at Marvell is that we've by design, developed this extremely flexible business model from merchant offerings where customers can prove about our IP because they can just go buy the part to this partner model we innovated, where it's a combination of our intellectual property and our customers to drive time to market as well as just being able to service this huge opportunity for custom silicon. And so, I think when I look forward, we're very enthusiastic about all the opportunities in front of us, and also the way that the platform we are really able to leverage. And when I mean platform, I mean, our design win platform, our technology platform where we don't have a lot of random adjacent businesses. What we do for a living is we do this data infrastructure silicon really, really well, and we do that in a very concentrated manner. And you see that both in our -- now our 5-nanometer platform, which we announced this week with TSMC and the translation of all that investment and the focus we have actually, surprisingly, even driving lower operating expenses than we had before. So I think it's a unique combination. And Tore, I would just say you nailed it. There is a big opportunity for Marvell on the go-forward here. Sure. Yes. Hey, Gary. So, I think at the highest level, and you know this well, we've had a long-term history with ARM. They're used in almost all of our products, and we cooperate on a number of different applications, like the ARM server opportunity to 5G, automotive, et cetera. So, two companies work together. And the way you should think about, again, what we're doing with the Thunder product line is really just focusing it. The market that we've always called out for this has always been the hyperscale customers. And so, what we're basically doing is just really acknowledging that and also acknowledging the fact that it turns out they seem to really want their own thing, their own special chip. And this notion of maybe if you go back a few years to where you would have a broad-based ARM server platform that you would drive and you could sell to everybody and maybe put it on like a TikTok type of cadence and sort of run it like a normal CPU business. I think just so much has changed since we acquired Cavium and this market's developed. ARM in the data center and ARM in servers has actually continued to get traction in the market, whether that's with us or that's with customers doing their own developments themselves in-house with partners. And so we expect that to continue. We're just going to do this in a much more focused and targeted manner and with a business model that looks more like our traditional customer semi-custom model versus funding the whole thing on our own kind of in perpetuity. We've said basically, -- we think it's more -- it's better for us and better for the customers actually to do this in a more focused manner. I hope that helps. Yes. Great questions, Harlan. And I think, yes, if you think about the storage business, the storage controller portion is performing quite well into Q3. As Jean sort of laid the breadcrumbs earlier on the Fibre Channel business, how to think about that market size, our share of it, how much it was down, we're basically offsetting that by growth in the -- both the SSD side, and to your point, in our custom SSD engagement as well as in both of our nearline customers that continue to ramp with our solutions of SOCs and then one also using our preamplifier solution as well. So yes, the traditional, call it, Marvell storage controller business is performing quite well in the near-term here coming off of the lows through the COVID-19, supply issues that were going on. So, that's doing well. It's really this very-targeted slowdown in enterprise we're seeing within the storage areas offsetting that growth. So, the growth drivers are very much working in storage is what I would say, the areas where we put a lot of R&D and investment in cloud applications as well as in DIY. It's nice to see the revenue coming in. And I think there's more to come on discussions of future DIY engagements, which we're very active in right now. Some of those have already turned into design wins with hyperscalers, and that is also part of our future growth strategy. To continue to keep storage growing is expanding with additional customers that we didn't have before. So, more on that later. Sure. Yes. I think, yes, so there was a lot of content we went through today. But the main point was that while there's a lot made certainly of the top five vendors, in the base station market -- and typically, those five are, call it, 90% of the total. So, it's a big number historically. But there's also a -- the remainder is currently quite active in this 5G transition. And I would say in almost every region, whether it's in parts of Asia, certainly North America and other geos, there is a lot of activity there in what we would call the second tier. And the nice thing is, is that the products that we develop for the top -- call the top guys, those are all going to be available as standard products for the rest of the market. And so, for example, the win that we got that's in the second tier, it's using the existing parts we already have. So obviously, a lot of leverage from that because we didn't have to go and design a brand new chip and spend a bunch of money on it, and they are able to leverage the investment that we already made. And without getting into dollars, what we did say is that the content is both the Fusion baseband, and you guys have a sense of what those go for, as well as our OCTEON embedded processor for the transport and layer 2 processing. So, we have very solid content from a processing perspective there. And I would say is, with -- the last thing, Tim, is with all the disruption going on in all the geopolitical events, I think there's an opportunity for this second tier to actually become more relevant in 5G, whether it's taking share from traditional incumbents or even with new standards like ORAN, where you might see new people come in and actually the meaningful participants in some of the regions. So, that's -- again, that's one that we're watching. But, it's nice that we're able to take kind of benefit from all the hard work we've done to put these IP platforms together, to be able to then go in and sell those and enable other customers of ours to participate in 5G market. Sure, Ross. Yes. I'd say, certainly, in the short term, we're seeing the impacts you said. And I think some of this may be certainly inventory related. I do think that when we had the supply crunch and countries we're shutting down left and right, I think certainly, OEMs wanted to make sure that they have some inventory. But, I would say that is also very much coupled depending on the segment you're talking about with just straight up demand weakness just given that certain segments of enterprise companies aren't spending on. And I think those are very well known. So -- but I'd say that the inventory part, unlike sort of, I'd say prior cycles, which I've been through, I'd say this one is just more on the demand side at this point. So that's really in the short term, and we just have to deal with that. We're still very encouraged, okay, and bullish about our enterprise offerings, once we're through this cycle we're in, especially as we look out to calendar \u201821. And I referenced in my remarks as well as you probably saw some of the announcements we made around our borderless enterprise. I mean, that whole thing is really code for Marvell just refreshed its entire Ethernet switching and PHY portfolio. And the last time we did that, which was a few years ago, we jumped a process node or 2 at that time. We added a whole bunch of features. We optimized the products. And we had great success. It was part of the kind of the initial Marvell turnaround story was that networking growth. And so, we see the same type of opportunity starting really next year with some of our new products, which are, again, in the latest process nodes that are relevant for those markets, the latest sets of features. And then, even beyond that, as we look out, I'd say, beyond next year and you start looking at our 5-nanometer portfolio, which we're sampling our first products next year on, but all the design wins that we're in the hunt on right now are really in that node for the large sockets. We're extremely well positioned. And I would say that even goes beyond Ethernet, and also looking out to our next-generation OCTEON products, which have gotten a lot of press because of their success in base stations recently. But don't forget about the wired market. And the wired market, I think, if you look at all the networking OEMs and communication OEMs and what they're going to need in the future and you look at us with a best-in-class infrastructure processor in 5-nanometer, which would be the 10th generation Cavium processor, we're very excited about that business between -- on a number of fronts. So I think the shorter term, we certainly have some chop. Fortunately, it's being offset by cloud and 5G. But we're still very optimistic on enterprise, which drives great margins for the Company, great stickiness. And I think, we'll benefit from the hard work the team has put in to really refresh the portfolio. We're seeing great traction on those products. Yes. And I'll just conclude on the second topic you mentioned about M&A. So, yes, I think we're -- first of all, we're very pleased with how all the effort we put in, in 2019. We bid off a lot, as you remember. We sold our Wi-Fi business to NXP, and then, we purchased Aquantia and Avera. And we made those decisions candidly right kind of in the midst of trade war and a lot of uncertainty. And I think reflecting back, we're thrilled that we made those decisions. I think, both of those acquisitions we did last year were performing better than we had anticipated when we announced them. As you saw from our results, I think, the benefit of the Marvell platform from a cost standpoint has really enabled us to run these 2 businesses that we acquired, very efficiently, while keeping key technical talent and key management talent, which we were thrilled to get. And so, we like those kind of deals. I think the prices paid were very reasonable. And certainly, they've really helped our Company. And so, look, we're in execution mode at this point. We got a lot of design wins in front of us. We're executing a 5-nanometer platform. But, we're always going to keep a look out and certainly very encouraged by the guidance we gave in terms of revenue growth. But also, if you even look at last quarter, it was the cash flow generation of the Company. I think you're starting to see that the Company has got a tremendous leverage in its operating model and can generate significant free cash flow as we grow, and that certainly sets us up well if we were to find opportunities to go after. But, as you know, we've been very-disciplined on this front. Multiples are definitely high at this point. We've got a lot going on. So, of course, we'll look around. But right now, I know myself and the team are plenty busy with executing our current initiatives that we've worked really hard to put together. But, we will see. Thank, Srini."

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thanks Matt and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue in the second quarter was $727 million, above middle point of our guidance. Networking represents 56% of our revenue in the second quarter with storage contributing 40%. Revenue from other accounted for 4% of revenue, declining 25% sequentially and 41% year-on-year. As a reminder, this business consists of product we have stopped investing in. So, we expect they will continue to decline over time. Our guidance for the third quarter anticipated a small sequential decline in revenue from these products. GAAP gross margin was 49.4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.3% of revenue, better than expectations, reflecting the hard work from our operations team to drive operational efficiency to improve our product costs. GAAP operating expenses were $511 million, and they include the cost of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition and divestiture related costs as well as the impairment and other related restructuring charges as a result of the changing scope of the similar processing program Matt discussed earlier in the call. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $297 million, $3 million lower than expected, primarily because of our continued focus on OpEx management. GAAP operating loss was $151 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $163 million or 22.4% of revenue. For the second quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.24. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.21, above the midpoint of the guidance. Now, turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $226 million. Our team continues to drive the improvement of working capital metrics in the second quarter. We improved our days of sales outstanding to 61 days and days of inventory to 90 days. We returned $40 million to shareholders through dividend payments. We have temporarily suspended our share repurchase program as we believe it's prudent to further strengthen our liquidity and increase our cash balance during the uncertain environment. We'll continue to evaluate the business conditions to decide when to restart share repurchase program. We exited the quarter with $832 million in cash and short-term investments, an increase of $164 million from the prior quarter. We continue to have $500 million of liquidity available from our undrawn revolver. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 0.8 times on a trailing 12-month basis. As of 4th of August 2020, the $450 million term loan is still within 12 months and has been classified as a short-term debt on the balance sheet. We expect our business to continue to generate a strong cash flow, and we intend to repay this amount with the cash flow from operations. I'm pleased that revenue growth combined with our strong business model and operating expense discipline, continue to drive improvement in operating results and strengthening our balance sheet. Now, moving on to our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Please note that compared to second quarter results, our outlook for operating expenses reflect the significant improvement Matt discussed earlier from the successful integration of Aquantia and Avera, continued operational discipline and the change in scope of the ARM server project. As a reminder, our operating expenses can vary quarter-to-quarter, affected by factors such as the number of tape-out within a particular quarter. And these tape-outs are becoming more expensive in newer process geometry. The cadence of an NRE payment, which are primarily treated as contra OpEx can also add variability. And we now have a higher level of NRE following the acquisition of Avera with their customer ASIC model. Due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes, our OpEx in the first fiscal quarter tends to increase sequentially, and this effect then dissipates in the rest of the fiscal year. Here is the specific guidance for the third quarter. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $750 million, plus or minus 5%. We anticipate our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 51.4%, and the non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 63%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $368 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $280 million. We expect net interest expense to be approximately $15 million and expect non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. As a result, we anticipate GAAP results in the range of a loss of $0.04 per diluted share on the low end to an income of $0.04 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.22 to $0.28. Operator, please open the line and announce the Q&A instructions. Thanks. Hey, operator, can you just move to the next person's question? Yes. First, we're really pleased that our team has done a great job to reduce the OpEx to $280 million quarterly run rate versus our original expectation. It's more like a $300 million when we entered into fiscal \u201821. So that's just a tremendous effort by realizing more synergies from Avera and Aquantia integration and also just operational efficiency across the board. So, if you think about that, we're investing in the right level and with our portfolio adjustment, the portfolio optimization, we constantly review as a company. We do see actually driving the revenue ramp. If you look at our Q3 guide, it implies revenue year-over-year growth of double digit. And the continued revenue ramp with the current operating expense level, we do think our model are going to show tremendous leverage and continue to drive the earnings expansion. If you look at our Q3 guide, the operating margin at the middle point of our guidance actually is close to 26%. So, I think we are setting up a great business model with the OpEx level to invest and to continue to expand. Hi. Michelle, I'll help you give you some color. We typically don't give all the details and report all the details. But to help you out, the way to think about it is Fibre Channel business, the overall market opportunity of SAM is about $500 million each year. It's quite a stable market. Actually, it's a split between Marvell and Broadcom. So, largely, we are very much similar size. And so, if you think about our Fibre Channel business, it's all selling into the enterprise data center on-premise. So, current weakness certainly impacts it tremendously. Sequentially, the revenue declined actually to 20% quarter-over-quarter. So, it's quite significant. Hopefully, that will give you some color. But we don't break down the details within the storage category generally. So Gary, we'll divide this question in two pieces. I'll answer the impairment part, then Matt can talk about the strategic side of the ARM business. So, the impairment actually is quite straightforward. As you recall, we acquired Cavium, and we closed the transaction two years ago. So, there's a very small piece of developed technology intangible related to all the TX2 Cavium developed before the acquisition of Marvell acquired Cavium. So, that's primarily, if you look at the impairment, the primary impairment is related the intangible developed technology of TX2, how Cavium did that business in the past. With our new focus going forward, definitely, those all the development technology intangible is going to be impaired. That's the impairment part of it. I'll let Matt answer the strategic side of the ARM server business. Yes. So, on the cash usage for the next few quarters, certainly, our business will continue to generate a very strong free cash flow. If you look at the first half of fiscal year 2021, our cash flow conversion is very significantly higher than the -- more than 100% of our net income. So, I think certainly, we're going to be able to pay down our short-term debt, which is $450 million. And the additional excess cash, we have always been quite committed to return cash to shareholders. Certainly, the macro environment is still uncertain, but we definitely will monitor and assess, if we should restart the share repurchase program. So, that's definitely what we are considering."

        "content": "Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to Marvell's First Quarter Fiscal Year 2021 Earnings Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker; Vice President of Investor Relations, Ashish Saran. Sir, please go ahead.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's first quarter fiscal year 2021 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO. I would like to remind everyone that certain comments today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our website in the Investor Relations section. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?\nMatthew Murphy: Thanks. Ashish and good afternoon everyone. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we delivered strong financial results and achieved $694 million in revenue, $14 million above the midpoint of guidance. As you may recall, our revenue guidance for the first quarter included an assumption for a 5% headwind from COVID-19. We did in fact experienced some impact on revenue from COVID-19-related issues but stronger-than-expected demand from our data center and 5G infrastructure end markets and our networking business drove consolidated company revenue above the midpoint. Compared to our assumptions when we provided our revenue guidance for the first quarter, the impact of COVID-19 turned out to be greater than expected in our storage business and lower than expected in our networking business. Our GAAP loss per share was $0.17. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.18, above the high end of our guidance range, driven by higher revenue and tight OpEx control. On a sequential basis revenue declined by 3%. However, compared to fourth quarter results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi, revenue for the ongoing business was actually flat on a sequential basis, a very solid result under current conditions, and in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. I'm extremely pleased with our team's ability to deliver great results despite the massive disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. The vast majority of our employees have been working from home since early March, earlier than most official shelter-in-place orders were announced, as the health and welfare of our employees and their families was our first priority. Our IT team quickly jumped into action to provide secure, remote access for our 5,000 plus employees. Our Worldwide Operations Group battled through a number of supply chain challenges and met the upside in demand in our networking business. Since the start of work from home, our engineering team has taped out eight new chips, an extremely high level of engineering output in this time frame, on schedule to meet our customers' critical timelines. Our sales team maintained a strong focus on customer communication through this critical time period and continue to drive our growing design win funnel. I have personally experienced a much higher level of direct engagement with the leadership at multiple key customers at the CEO level. Normally, I fly out, meet my counterparts in person a few times a year. But during this crisis we have quickly adopted virtual meetings over video to increase the frequency of communication. We believe the change in cadence reflects our customers' desire to involve us deeply as a trusted partner in solving their need for higher bandwidth and storage in the post COVID-19 world. Our mission as an infrastructure semiconductor solution provider to move, store, process and secure the world's data has never been more relevant and we are seeing strong demand drivers for our products and technology. I truly believe that the culture, we have created at Marvell is enabling our success and has earned us the trust of our employees, customers and partners, and our new brand reflects these values. Celebrating the company's 25 year anniversary, we recently launched Marvell's new brand identity, marking a milestone in our transformation to focus on semiconductor solutions for data infrastructure. This was something we had considered doing soon after we started to pivot the Company in the fall of 2016. But as you know, the company's brand is their reputation, and a reputation is earned. So instead we focused first on creating our new strategy, revamping our culture building, operational excellence and delivering business results. After four years of hard work, we are ready to reveal a new brand that mirrors our culture, which focuses on the substance first. Our brand is built on a foundation of collaboration and partnership with our customers and we are driven by the belief that doing things the right way matters. Essential technology done right reflects our customer-centric approach, to high quality tailored solutions. None of this would be possible without our dedicated employees who have been putting in a lot of extra hours through this unusual period which is likely to persist for a while. Recognizing this challenge we are giving all employees a few extra days off and we are shutting down for a four day recharge weekend in the June. Similarly, we have taken steps to help our contractors and the local community. We are continuing to pay our hourly workers in full as well as the service providers that support our facilities, regardless of whether they can fully perform their duties. In addition Marvell has started a COVID-19 relief fund to support our global communities and provide financial relief to those in need. A portion of the fund is dedicated to matching employee donations, so that employees will also have the opportunity to participate. Until we are able to return to the office in Santa Clara, we plan to donate our entire cafeteria grocery budget to the Second Harvest Food Bank in support of those in need. It is in times of crisis that our values and leadership principles are truly tested. I'm proud of our team and the company we have built. We are in the fortunate position of being able to take care of our people and give back to our communities when it really counts. During and after this crisis, we expect the demand for bandwidth to continue to grow stronger. Major cloud and service providers are facing unprecedented demand for their services as a result of so many people working from home and are scrambling to add capacity to their networks. 5G has become a strategic priority for many nations and also an economic growth driver for economies worldwide. Enterprises are rapidly upgrading their networking infrastructure to support their workforce with remote access to critical business applications and advanced collaboration tools and a secure and scalable environment. We are in the midst of enabling all the key megatrends in 5G, data center cloud, enterprise and automotive as a leading supplier of their infrastructure semiconductors. Over the last few quarters, we have discussed in detail our progress in the carrier market tied to the transition to 5G. Investor focus has been high in this area and I'll provide color on this opportunity in a few moments. For now, I'd like to draw your attention to the cloud data center market, which represents an opportunity for our storage and networking products, similar in magnitude to 5G. This is in addition to our ARM server opportunity, which we have previously outlined as a large multi-billion dollar market for us. We've been working on building our business through organic investments over the past four years, as well as through products and engagements via the Cavium and Avera acquisitions. We are now starting to see the benefits from these efforts and I'm excited to share them with you. In our storage business over the last few years we've been transitioning our HDD business to focus on nearline drives, which are primarily consumed by cloud datacenters and this business has been growing nicely for us, through both our storage controllers and pre-amplifiers. We expect that the 16-terabyte transition this year will drive strong growth for us. Our custom flash controllers are very well suited for cloud customers who have unique storage applications and are looking to disaggregate their SSDs to optimize performance and we pioneered the do-it-yourself model. We also have storage accelerators in evaluation at multiple cloud customers. In virtualized environments and cloud data centers multiple customers can be accessing the same physical storage resources simultaneously. To ensure quality of service, expensive CPU cycles are consumed in managing workloads to ensure that all clients get uninterrupted access to their stored data. Our NVMe storage accelerators enables a better solution by offloading storage IO and freeing up CPU cycles, provisioning bandwidth and ensuring low latency to satisfy service level agreements, which are difficult to achieve with software-only solutions. We expect to see initial production ramps for our storage accelerators starting later this year. In our networking business, our OCTEON compute platform is ideally suited for a variety of offload and acceleration applications in hyperscale datacenters. At GTC 2020 last week. Jensen Huang referred to this category of computing as the DPU, or data processing unit and indicated it would represent the third major pillar of computing in hyperscale data centers after the CPU and GPU. We couldn't agree more. OCTEON is an ideal DPU platform as it is an SoC that combines a scalable multi-core ARM processor, high performance networking in a variety of hardened acceleration engines. As many of you know Cavium was a pioneer in this area. We have continued investing in this segment since the acquisition. Our recently announced OCTEON TX2 was specifically designed for cloud applications such as our LiquidIO programmable smart SmartNIC and LiquidSecurity HSM, or hardware security module product lines. Cloud infrastructure requires optimized hardware for performance, cost and power at scale. Data center operators can achieve these goals by moving specific workloads on the highly optimized off-load engines, even the host server to run more efficiently. Our LiquidIO Smart NICs offload network virtualization, storage protocols, security, distributed firewall, software-defined networks and an network overlay for various cloud datacenter models. Our latest LiquidIO SmartNIC incorporating OCTEON TX2 is ramping now as cloud provider demand is surging. Our LiquidSecurity HSM, which have been adopted by multiple leading cloud providers to provide fully managed cloud hosted protection for cryptographic keys and Crypto-as-a-Service are also ramping. Last year we announced deployments with Amazon, Google and Oracle and I am pleased that we have recently added another large Tier 1 cloud customer. Our ARM-based server processors have been qualified at Microsoft for internal Azure development workloads and we are looking forward to broader adoption in production environments. Our ThunderX3 processor will become available later this year and we continue to engage with additional cloud providers on our solutions. The Avera acquisition brings to us leading edge custom chip design capability, which continues to become more relevant as hyperscalers seek to differentiate and control their own key pieces of silicon. They have very specific needs, and we can combine our leading intellectual property with their own unique IP to most efficiently solve their most complex system design challenges. As these customers continue to design their own silicon, they need a reliable ASIC partner that they can count on for the long haul. Avera was already shipping into the cloud market when we acquired them and they brought over additional cloud design wins which have yet to go into production. The level of engagement with hyperscalers has also continued to grow, after we completed the acquisition and we are seen as a very attractive choice for next generation design decisions. Collectively, we are now building strong cloud franchise, combining our storage networking and processor technology and have the unique ability to deliver products in standard, custom and semi-custom solutions. I'm pleased to report that for the first time we estimate that our revenue from the cloud market exceeded 10% of total company revenue, growing from a fairly small position at the same time last year. We expect that this business will continue to grow with that end market and our own unique product cycles and become another key growth driver for Marvell. Let me now move on to discussing our two businesses in more detail. First, in our networking business revenue during the quarter was $394 million and grew 5% sequentially, significantly above our expectations for a low to mid-single digit decline. Compared to fourth quarter results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi growth for the continuing networking business in the first quarter was in the double-digit sequentially. And I'm thrilled with this result. Excellent supply chain execution allowed us to meet strong demand from cloud data centers for our Smart NICs and security adapters that I discussed earlier. Our one gig and 10 gig PHY products experienced robust demand from enterprise data centers as companies continue to upgrade the core of their network operations to deal with higher security and throughput demands. Our wireless infrastructure business grew sequentially and performed better than our expectations of a flattish quarter in strong contrast to the pause or slowdown in 5G deployments mentioned by a number of industry peers for the same time period. We are benefiting from the start of the 5G build out in China where we have content through two of our key customers, who collectively have been awarded about 50% of the share of recently announced contracts. We are currently supplying custom ASICs and standard connectivity products to these customers and are working with them on additional opportunities. In addition, we have a very strong position at Samsung where we have just started to ship our full suite of solutions and expect that their success in Korea, Japan and the US, to drive growth in the coming year. Our custom baseband solution for Nokia is progressing very well through qualification and we expect to start production later this year. Collectively, we are designed into the latest generation of base stations in to multiple OEMs, which are expected to be powering all key geographies over several years. We are still at the very beginning of the industry transition from 4G to 5G and look forward to driving significant revenue growth from this end market. Demand from the enterprise campus end market remained stable on a sequential basis, a good outcome under current market conditions. When we start to come out of the COVID-19 crisis, we are looking forward to the deployment of Wi-Fi 6 which requires higher speed Ethernet connections. We expect this adoption will drive growth for our multi-gig Ethernet products as we have a very strong design win position across most leading OEMs for enterprise Wi-Fi access points. And we also have a strong position on campus switches, which aggregate traffic from these access points. We recently taped out additional products from our recently announced OCTEON TX2 family of ARM-based infrastructure processors, including our flagship highest performance solution featuring 36 cores which can deliver up to 200 gigabits per second of packet processing for the most demanding applications. We also tapped out our Fusion-based processor, customized for massive MIMO applications for our leading wireless customer ahead of schedule. Our customer will be using this solution in their high volume massive MIMO SKUs and we expect to be ramping into production in the fall. The design win funnel for OCTEON processors is continuing to expand with a broad set of Tier 1 networking and high-end security firewall OEMs. The OCTEON platform is an extensive ARM-based embedded processor product family which can scale from four cores at the low end to 36 cores on the high end, all on a common software framework. This is a critical advantage for Marvell when engaging with Tier 1 networking OEMs who want to partner with solution providers able to support their broad range of products, allowing massive software reuse. We are deep into the development already of our next generation OCTEON family based on advanced node process technology. The combined strength of our recent OCTEON announcements and aggressive roadmap is resonating very well with key OEMs. In our emerging automotive business, there are encouraging signs that auto production is restarting in multiple geographies. And if this happens, we expect to start ramping Ethernet switches and PHYs in the second half of our fiscal year for the designs we had one in model year 2021 vehicles. We expect to grow our automotive footprint over the next few years through our Ethernet connectivity products, but we see an even bigger opportunity for Marvell as cars continue to evolve towards becoming truly connected platforms. Traditional point to point solutions in cars are heading towards zonal architectures, very similar to modern enterprise networking, where endpoints connect to centralized compute and storage resources over a secure Ethernet backbone. We believe that we have all the pieces in place to be a leader in the market for this evolution, low power and high performance ARM-based embedded processors, proven security IP, automotive grade gigabit and multi-gigabit Ethernet connectivity, advanced storage technology and a solution delivery model which can span from standard product to full custom. We will discuss this broader initiative in more detail at our Investor Day in October. Let me now discuss the outlook for our networking business. After a very strong first quarter we expect our networking business to continue to grow in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and project revenue to increase in the low-single digits sequentially. We expect this growth to be driven by 5G wireless infrastructure deployments and our carrier end market. Looking out to the third quarter, based on our recent bookings and firm backlog position, we expect our 5G business to continue to ramp, strongly. Turning now to our storage business, storage revenue for the first quarter was $259 million, a double-digit sequential decline, worse than our expectations for a mid-single digit decline. This was due to multiple manufacturing facilities in Southeast Asia coming under new shelter-in-place orders in connection with COVID-19 as the quarter progressed, impacting production of fiber channel adapters and hard disk drives. Our SSD controller business, in contrast remained resilient and grew sequentially, driven by higher shipments in to data center applications. Looking to the second quarter, we expect our storage business to start to recover from COVID-19 impacts on the supply chain. Although a full recovery is more likely in our third quarter. We have started initial shipments of our custom SSD controllers for system level applications in our second fiscal quarter. As a result, we are projecting storage revenue growth of approximately 10% sequentially for the second quarter. This custom SSD controller is based on our new PCIe Gen4 architecture and was developed in close collaboration with our customer to create a storage controller uniquely tailored to their application. I'm very pleased with our strong engineering and operations execution, which has enabled us to start early shipments to meet our customers' production schedule. We expect the storage controller to ramp into high volume in our third fiscal quarter. In closing, we have a strategy focused on semiconductor solutions for data infrastructure. The critical nature of that infrastructure became even more evident during the current crisis, as it keeps people connected, businesses running and information flowing. Our pivot to data infrastructure wasn't an accident, and is a direct result of our decisive strategic portfolio actions over the last four years. Our strategy is in place. We are executing well and we have the right team and technology to exceed our customers' expectations. Our booking and backlog trends are very healthy, especially in 5G cloud and custom SSD, and support our expectations of driving overall company growth beyond the second quarter. We of course will continue to closely monitor demand signals from our customers in this uncertain environment. We remain confident in our ability to continue to benefit over the long term from the macro trends I outlined during this call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nJean Hu: Thanks, Matt and good afternoon everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the first quarter and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue in the first quarter was $694 million above the middle point of our guidance. Networking represented 57% of our revenue in the first quarter with storage contributing 37%. Revenue from other accounted for 6% of our revenue as we maintain this business consists of products such as print solutions and application processors. As we have stopped investing, so we expect they will continue to decline over time. Our guidance for the second quarter anticipate an approximately 20% sequential decline in revenue for these products. GAAP gross margin was 47.1%, which includes the amortization of both Aquantia and Avera inventory step-up cost. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.8% of revenue and it reflects the change in product mix compared to our expectations, as Matt discussed earlier. GAAP operating expenses were $423 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $300 million, lower than expected, primarily because of our continued focus on OpEx management and the lower travel expenses due to the COVID -19 impact. I'm pleased that we were able to get to our target for non-GAAP operating expenses three quarters than earlier than expected. And we currently intend to manage OpEx at this level through the rest of the fiscal year. GAAP operating loss was $96 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $136 million or 19.6% of revenue. For the first quarter GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.17. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.18 above the high end of our guidance range. Now turning to our balance sheet, during the quarter, cash flow from operations was $176 million. We returned $65 million to shareholders, through 25 million in share repurchases, and $40 million in dividends. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program midway way through the first quarter as we believe it's prudent to further strengthen our liquidity and the increase our cash balance during the uncertain environment. We'll continue to evaluate the business conditions to decide when to restart the share repurchase a program. We exited the quarter with $660 million in cash and short-term investment, and we have $500 million liquidity available from our undrawn revolver. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times on a trailing 12 month basis. I'm very pleased with our solid financial performance in the first quarter here and in the current environment. We achieved this result by building a strong business model to focus on the growing opportunities in the infrastructure market and continuing to be very disciplined in operating our business to focus on channel investment, while keeping ample liquidity and low debt leverage ratio. Our performance also underpins our strong investment grade credit profile, which provides us with significant financial flexibility to invest in our long-term growth initiatives, so we can emerge from this uncertain time even stronger. Now moving on to our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $720 million, plus or minus 5%. We anticipate our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 50.6%. And our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 63%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $393 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $300 million. We expect net interest expense to be approximately $15 [ph] million and expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. As a result, we anticipate that GAAP loss per diluted share in the range of $0.02 to $0.10 and non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.17 to $0.23. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri of UBS. Your question please.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. In the release you had mentioned that you had some impact for the trade -- for what's happening in trade. So Jean, can you just talk about that and talk about maybe what the impact is and maybe whether there is a longer term opportunity, maybe now that High Silicon is going to be quite restricted in sort of what they can build. Will there be an opportunity for you there? And, I guess also -- I just wanted to ask whether you have an update on the $600 million incremental 5G opportunity. Sounds like it's going to be quite a bit bigger than that, maybe it's big as a $1 billion. So I'm wondering if you can comment on that. Thanks.\nJean Hu: Yes, hi, Tim. Thank you. Yes, on the trade impact. I think the impact from Huawei it has happened in the past. So we -- it's already impacted our revenue last year. We actually almost have no Huawei revenue anymore going forward. On the other customers, right now based on our assessment we don't see additional impact. And I think the way to think about it is there -- it's uncertain. But right now we don't see other impact. I'll let Matt answer the 5G question.\nMatthew Murphy: Sure, yes. And Tim just to clarify on the trade side, yes, as Jean mentioned we felt primarily the brunt of that impact, about a year ago when the initial restrictions were put in place. And so we've worked through that issue. I think the other thing you may be asking is, what's the kind of overall picture if there's an impact to that particular customer in the 5G space and will other vendors take share, will that be a tailwind for Marvell? And the answer to that is in our current base case assumption we're assuming no share shifts. We have strong position at the other four, but certainly to the extent that there are SHARE movements within the 5G players that would be to the benefit of other customers that we supply, that would be a good thing for us. Related to that was your was your second part of the question, which was on the long-term opportunity. Yes, it's actually a little bit larger. It was $600 million when we standalone Marvell, and then when we did the acquisition of Avera, we added another $150 million of run rate business coming over. So, that really framed the whole opportunity at $750 million. We still feel very good about that as you heard in my prepared remarks, as well as even some of the comments from last quarter, we continue to have very strong design win momentum there and content increase at a number of the key players. And we continue to be heavily engaged and we're still in the early stages of this and we hope to update that figure at some point in the future, but just clearly based on what we've won already there is $750 million that's in the pipeline. Probably a little bit more if you look at the Nokia partnership that we announced last quarter. So that's very much on track. Thanks for the question by the way.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay, understood, Matt. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley of Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.\nGary Mobley: Hey, everyone. Good afternoon. Congrats on a start to -- a good start to the fiscal year. Want to start out by asking about the strength that you've been seeing on the networking side in particular, 5G and cloud as well. And so clearly we've seen some good demand trends there, and I'm just curious to hear your perspective on where we might sit with respect to some of those customers maybe adding some capacity ahead of demand or are they playing catch up and trying to get a sense of whether or not there might be some carry through on the strength in the second half of the year.\nMatthew Murphy: Sure, yes, Gary, this is Matt. I'll take that. So we're off to a great start in our first quarter. As I indicated last quarter, there was -- we had a lot of momentum in our business exiting the year. I would also give you a higher level framework to start with, which is remember that the overall semiconductor industry in 2019 went through the third largest down cycle we've seen in the last 25 years, primarily on the back of the trade tensions. And so coming into calendar '20, just kind of broadly speaking inventories were low in the customer base and supply chain, certainly even at Marvell our own inventories through our channel and our customers were low. And so the demand that we had seen exiting the year even before COVID-19 hit has continued and the drivers we see in our business are, we think very sustainable. Certainly in the two areas that you mentioned, we're at the early stages of 5G and you've got the China market, that is expecting to have a very robust demand this year. That's all very sort of publicly announced, and we're at the beginning stages of that. We expect other regions to continue to follow, which would be very good for our customers. On the cloud side I think that demand trend is certainly here to stay. And while there has been some talk about potential digestion and things of that nature, at least from our lens as Marvell, we have very unique product cycles that we mentioned, both on our Smart NICs are brand new LiquidIO III SmartNIC product which is ramping very strongly. Our LiquidSecurity products, storage, I think there is a strong view on the nearline side that, that will be a very good year. So overall, at least from Marvell, we think those are very sustainable. Last comment I would make is in Q1 we had the additional benefit of some very good enterprise strength, primarily and enterprise data center and that helped us as well. So I think we've got a nice setup of various moving pieces, but certainly from a sustainability standpoint, we see 5G and Cloud really driving our business this year, through the remainder of the year.\nGary Mobley: Okay. And the follow-up question I want to ask about China and 5G. You mentioned some success and market share gains for some of your customers in that region, based on their tender activity and what not. Why don't you anticipate a more meaningful contribution for that specific region?\nMatthew Murphy: Well, it's--- in -- a little bit started and helped us even in the first quarter is that again, we'll see more in Q2 with really we see a very, very strong Q3, our Q3 for that particular business. And I would say that's really when the volume starts. So we're still in the early stages of that build with some of that comprehended in our Q2, but a much stronger outlook for Q3 and beyond.\nGary Mobley: Got you. I appreciate it, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of CJ Muse of Evercore. Your line is open.\nCJ Muse: Yes, good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. I guess another question on China. Could you walk through your infrastructure exposure there both direct and through Avera and potentially additional opportunities outside of Huawei? Thank you.\nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Hey CJ, I'll start with that and then I'll ask Jean to add if she'd like to. So couple of things to note, we definitely have indigenous China revenue. We -- prior to the entity list issues Huawei was our number one customer in China and I think that's been very well-telegraphed what's going on there. As you heard my commentary, we've ended up gaining some share at their biggest competitor in China. And so that's going to service really well in the 5G ramp. And then additionally we supply a number of other OEMs. We haven't broken that number out. But what I'd say is if you look at our historical Qs, they just have shipped to numbers, now like 50%, 47% and that's obviously way overstated because that reflects primarily contract manufacturing activity in the region. So, we've got I think exposure in the right places there both -- in 5G as well as some of the key enterprise OEMs there, and then we have some distribution as well. So I think our business is reasonably diversified outside of the first customer I mentioned.\nCJ Muse: Thank you.\nAshish Saran: Thanks, CJ. Can we have the next question, please?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the improving growth and the execution. Matt, just a clarification, I think you started to mention something about networking continuing growth in Q3. I was wondering if you could elaborate on that. And then the question really is, have you seen any double ordering or excess inventory or any abnormal orders from any of your customers in cloud or data center or the China markets, because I think we conceptually get that certain parts of your customer base are strong, but just given all the macro issues, I think investors are naturally worried about anything abnormal that might be going on because of all the trade concerns that that are ongoing. So any color in terms of actual consumption of your products I think would be very helpful, thank you.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes, great. Let me start with Q3 and then I'll move to the over-ordering question as well. So on Q3, just to be clear at the highest level, what I said in my prepared remarks, was that we see -- we do see overall company revenue increasing from Q2 to Q3. At this point given the visibility we have. That's overall company and that's driven by primarily our networking business, which is 5G and Cloud, but also by since custom SSD opportunity I mentioned. And so we see strength actually beyond Q2, both in our networking business and in our storage business. On the subject of double ordering and the concerns out there, look, I a bit on this rodeo for a while. I've seen various shocks to the system. And then the resultant supply-demand imbalances. And I'm very acutely sensitive to those, in watching those like a hawk. From our point of view, I think the interesting dynamic on this one, Vivek, as I mentioned earlier is that the industry exiting '19 was coming out of a very severe downturn where customer inventory levels were low. And so, certainly, there has been, -- there has been a -- now they probably over did it and I think even certainly without COVID-19, I think we were going to see even probably stronger demand, as we indicated for last quarter. So that's one part of the set up. And the second is, we've. I mean we've, at least in Marvell, we really over-indexed on this in terms of spending time on this matter, and trying to look at all the customer ordering patterns. Does their market share add up to more than 100% and how much do we think is buffer versus not. And the end conclusion is I'm very comfortable with the current forecast we have and also backlog and order position that we've got. And I just make another note, which is as well. Just to hedge it a little bit, I mean we've been running our distribution Inventory well below kind of our target levels. And part of that is just to ensure that we maintain integrity in the demand side and make sure what we're shipping is needed, but all things point to an aggregate. We don't see a double ordering issue. Final point I'd make is we haven't been afraid to call those out. I mean if you look at the third quarter of 2018 calendar, this was right when the trade war -- the tariffs were being announced and I mean, if you're probably remember this we had a 29% year-over-year - year growth in that quarter in our Marvell's networking business, and we were actually the first company to kind of point out. We think that this is not normal, right and that we shouldn't expect this to continue and we tried to plan our business around that. So we've been forthcoming when we see it. At this point we see the supply demand balance, at least in our view to be pretty much in line, but we are paying close attention to it.\nVivek Arya: Thank you.\nMatthew Murphy: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Atif Malik of Citi. Your line is open.\nAtif Malik: Thank you for taking my question and good job on results and guide. Jean. I have a question that you have talked about Avera plus Aquantia minus wireless adding about $100 million to fiscal 21 sales in the past, I don't expect you to break out these acquisitions anymore, but can you just talk about if you're running above this run rate currently with Aquantia and Avera.\nJean Hu: Yes, so we're very pleased with both acquisitions. I think last earnings call, we said that both Aquantia and Avera have been on track with our expectations, definitely through this year. We think that they are going to perform better than our expectations, just based on the backlog of the order pattern and everything. So overall, very, very pleased with the two acquisitions.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes, and I'll just add to back that up. We had a very strong Q4 and Q1. And so the six months that we've owned both of them, we've gained a lot of confidence that not only are those the right acquisitions to do, but the level of top line contribution was going to be not only right where we thought, but probably given all the dynamics I mentioned, with strength in cloud and strength in 5G that is benefiting certainly Avera. And then on Aquantia, as I mentioned, we've had very good enterprise strength in some of these segments. So we do see both of those probably performing better than we had indicated back at the time of announcement for calendar '20.\nAtif Malik: Thanks.\nMatthew Murphy: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon and great job on the quarterly execution. On your DIY SSD controller with your lead customer, good to see the initial ramp this quarter. Given that this is a semi-custom ship, utilizing the vast majority of your I, I assume that you're the sole supplier of this SSD controller. So in other words, your customer may be using different NAND memory suppliers, but they will be using your controller solution irrespective, is my assumption correct, because I'm just trying to size opportunity because your customer's platforms here has a historical cadence of ramping anywhere from 5 million to 7 million units in the first year to around 16 million to 20 million units by year three. So pretty substantial opportunity if you guys are the sole supplier.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes.\nJean Hu: Harlan, you are right. Yes.\nMatthew Murphy: I'll take this, Jean, and then you can add. So yes, no, you're right and in fact, the way to think about it is any -- all of these DIY opportunities are by design proprietary and sole source in nature. And they -- to your point, they typically incorporate pretty substantial and rich IP from Marvell. And then as a result of that we're able to command better ASPs and also add an additional functionality above and beyond what you would sort of normally think of a standard SSD controller is being valued at. So, I think it's a great combination of -- in any of these DIY efforts that we have going on and there are several of them where we have very close collaboration with the OEM to find really something that's very special and unique for what they need. And then, the result of that is they can get pretty significant performance benefits across a wide variety of applications, when it comes to flash-based storage. So yes, proprietary sole-source and on track to ramp.\nHarlan Sur: Great job in the execution.\nJean Hu: Yes, I'll just add, right. Matt said earlier, we already started production in Q2, which is much earlier than we expected. And then Q3 certainly that's the major ramp. It's going to happen.\nHarlan Sur: Great, thanks for the insights.\nMatthew Murphy: Thanks, Harlan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nRoss Seymore: Hi guys, thanks for letting me ask a question. Matt, I want to go back to the cloud theme that you talked about in your script. And kind of clarification on a question, that greater than 10% number that you talked about, which is up a lot year-over-year, just roughly how is that split between the two segments, storage and networking and more importantly going forward, how do you expect that to grow? Customers can be very, very lumpy, especially on what I would assume would be your networking side of the business. It could be a little bit more steady on the storage side, but give us an idea of how we should think about monitoring the growth and kind of the lumpiness of that going forward.\nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. Ross and I'm glad you brought it up, I mean we definitely wanted to spend time on it. I think if you look at the last year or so, we've been very focused and certainly from an investor point of view, the demand for questions and information and the opportunity for Marvell at least has really been framed around 5G. As I mentioned that continues to be not only a great opportunity, we're actually starting to ship. And so it's nice to see the results now catching up with the thesis. So very pleased about that. And so the thing that's really come together though in parallel, as we did the various portfolio moves last year and even going back farther kind of the Marvell organic investments that we've made, we have been very focused on cloud and hyperscale. We do see that as a big SAM and a big opportunity. And so what's -- we thought it was an appropriate time to talk about that and break it out because a lot of things have come together in that business is now ramping. And it's actually strong in both our networking and storage side and we see both of those opportunities as being quite significant. That's excluding ARM server. I mean ARM server, you just dump that one on top of it, but even ex ARM server, we see the SAM for our networking and storage products, and now the combined company with all the moves we've made as being an equivalently large opportunity as 5G. And while cloud spend can be lumpy, we certainly have that in other markets. The carrier market isn't exactly the hallmark of stability. That thing certainly can move around as everybody that's been involved in base stations knows. So there can be some lumpiness to the business, but at the same time, because of the breadth of the products we sell into that market in cloud and even if you look at 5G, it's the same thing, because we sell to a wide range of OEMs with a wide suite of technology, we do -- we are able to smooth out some of the lumpiness. But I think the key thing I would point to is both businesses now are becoming significant for Marvell, both businesses, we expect to grow this year and beyond. And I think it's a horse race between the two on which one can be bigger, if you look out over several, several years. And so that's really, Ross why we want to spend the time on it. We think it's a pretty major opportunity, but when it was so small a year ago before we did Aquantia -- I'm sorry, before we did -- we had Avera plus some of our own designs hadn't kicked in. We didn't want to do that but it reminds me of -- it when I was at Maxim and we had a very nascent emerging automotive business, and then there was a point where we had an analyst and we decided to break it out, because it crested over 10% and then it was off to the races. So, I think those are some of the -- some additional considerations for you to think about on our cloud business beyond my prepared remarks.\nAshish Saran: Thanks, Ross. Can we have the next question please?\nOperator: Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Blayne Curtis of Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I was just curious, Matt, you provided a wider range, and kind of curious how you're thinking about that. Clearly the factory shutdown did impact you in storage, it seems like most factories are kind of back on line. So it seems like some of the headwinds or tailwinds, I'm kind of curious what you're thinking about. On the other side of the coin there as you look out into Q2 as well. At the end of the year.\nMatthew Murphy: So, I'll give you both sides of the coin. I think on the one hand you could take the argument you just said, which is what we see today, by the way, that things appear to be stabilizing as factories are coming online and countries are reopening and so forth. At the same time though, I mean let's just take a big step back right? The whole world and environment is highly uncertain and the rate at which thing hit us, I think caught everybody off guard and so I wouldn't read too much into it other than we widened the range last quarter. And just out of the abundance of caution, there is no reason to tighten at this point, but we don't see anything -- differently than you mentioned at the beginning. I mean, we -- it seems like we've got our demand -- we've got our demand drivers. We have seen strong orders. We've got good backlog position those types of things. So we have confidence in our business, but it's really just around the broader level uncertainty and I think our range by the way is very consistent actually with a lot of other semi hears or I we'll probably leave it a little bit wider until we -- the world seems to stabilize.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks for that.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes, hi guys, congratulations on the results. Matt, maybe another way to ask Blayne's question, you guys clearly have a different go-to market model than a lot of other semi more direct less distribution and at least relative to some of the broad-based. You have a lot fewer customers, but I'm just kind of curious as I look towards the guide for July, it seems like a lot of your peers significantly discounted their bookings and backlog trends when they gave guide guidance for June, July. Just trying to take a level of conservatism. I'm just wondering if you can give us any color on how you constructed this guide relative just to all the backdrop of the macro uncertainty. And as an example some companies have guided to 100% backlog coverage where they normally guide to 75% to 80% backlog coverage.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes. Sure, John. Yes, happy to answer that. And I have seen that commentary, and I think it does have a lot to do with what you mentioned. In particular, probably the analog-mixed-signal guys who have a much broader customer set, highly distribution-oriented consumer and industrial type of exposure in automotive as well, where those types of market seem to have been hit very, very hard. I think our market mix is clearly benefiting us at this point in our strategy that we really have been driving for the last several years, I think is become extremely pertinent in this new world. And so I think we're quite different than maybe some of the other broader based folks who -- I don't blame them for being extremely conservative. And I understand those dynamics, that they may face, but I'd say with us setting in. I mean we also --through the mix changes, because we're not selling as much into consumer anymore. As an example, the lead times that we get are solid. Our terms and conditions are quite solid. The backlog coverage we get is, especially with Avera coming in and think of it as Avera coming in and Aquantia and Wi-Fi going out, and you swap that sort of consumer for infrastructure you're just getting a much better backlog position. And on top of that, we've got the channel quite lean and we're also carrying some delinquency higher than we normally do. And so that gives which is -- which means we've got -- we've got backlog that's out in Q3 that customers would like us to ship into Q2 and that has increased relative to where we normally run it. And so I think that -- those are some of the other data points, John, that give us give us comfort in the guide as well as just our starting backlog position is has been higher than most quarters since we've been here.\nJohn Pitzer: Perfect. Great color. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna. Your line is open.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks for the question. Matt, in your prepared comments you spoke about Jensen and the DPU and you guys were really pioneers in smart tech -- SmartNIC technology with LiquidIO and Cavium there and you called that out specifically as a driver this quarter. I know Cavium used to have one key partner there that eventually went internal with their own development, but perhaps you can talk about this renewed interest, how broad, is it, what kind of levels are we at, are we close to old levels and is it going to be sustainable in your opinion in this time?\nMatthew Murphy: Yes, great, thanks Chris. Great question. So first point on DPU I thought that was really, really well done by our colleagues over at NVIDIA and it's certainly resonated. I think that was the clearest way that I've seen anybody explain what these products do and I think the market in general has gotten confused over with the SmartNIC is on a NIC kind of a commodity thing and it's sort like fungible and liquid and it just -- I think. -- this is a much crisper way to describe it. And so and it certainly fits as you point out, kind of a key IP and a key area that the Cavium really pioneered. And so with respect to our smart NIC offerings that -- I think kind of it's consistent with the question that Ross asked. We spent a lot of time talking about 5G last year but very quietly, we've been continuing those roadmaps. And so that is ramping, it's highly sustainable. We -- and it's -- and we're engaged with multiple OEMs between the ramps that we're getting plus new opportunities and engagements and I actually think we're in, probably one of the best positions of any semiconductor company to truly tailor and optimize solutions based around the smart NIC type of architecture. Because we have all the pieces right. We have the latest generation OCTEON core which is highly programmable, we have network connectivity in Ethernet. We have security, we have access and development in investment in the most advanced node process technologies. And we have ASIC capability, which is a trend that we see as well where some of the large hyperscalers are just saying, let's go skip over a LiquidIO type of solution. Let's go directly to our very special thing that we want and we think we can provide a similar type of solution there just like we do in our co-partner model on baseband where we contribute a big chunk of the IP. The customer can also contribute, we stitch it together, they get exactly what they want. We can do it very quickly, without the customer having to hire a gigantic design team and take three years. So, I think it's a very compelling opportunity, Chris, both on the current ramps we're seeing on the latest generation products as well as our roadmap and the ability to customize and drive this product area forward. Thanks for the question.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks, Matt. Congrats on the quarter.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes, thanks. See you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley. Your question please.\nJoe Moore: Great, thank you. You talked about Thunder and the enthusiasm that you have there. Can you talk a little bit about like some -- what are the key workloads that you're addressing and is this. I think at one point there was the thought that this sort of is a replacement for Intel on a broad base of applications and versus something that's kind of an accelerant for a few key workloads. Like what's just a framework of how you're thinking of that now over the next three to five years.\nMatthew Murphy: Sure, Joe. Yes, I think the, the world, the whole thunder investment that we're making has continued to be really focused down. I mean if you went back to sort of pre-acquisition of caveat I think there was a view that said there is a very large market for this, we can sell to a whole ton of customers across a whole bunch of different applications and serve a number of workloads and go head to head with more general-purpose type x86. And really the direction that we've taken is to really focus the product down and tailor it really around a handful of key vendor -- key customers in the cloud area, and within that as an example in our announcement publicly we had with Microsoft, where we are the first property that we're [ph] in is in Azure storage. And the way we developed and defined the product was really ideal for that application but we can certainly do a high level of customization for these hyperscalers because they know exactly what they need. And so we do see opportunities in expanding in the more compute-oriented applications and workloads but that's sort of in the future. But again, I'd sort of transition the Thunder story just to bridge everybody from. hey, it's broad based, it's going to go to take on x86 and take on the world across all kinds of applications to really the evolution over the last few years under a more focused effort to really focus around the hyperscale opportunity and tailor it specifically to those customers and what they need.\nJoe Moore: Great, thank you.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Your question please.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. Congratulations on the results on the -- the new branding. I really liked the logo. Not to sort of steal your thunder from your Analyst Day in October, but you talked about in the automotive space, you kind of see the zonal architecture, that's very similar in the sort of enterprise networking world, I was just wondering how that's going to play out. Will you be working with networking companies here or will you be working with the hyperscale guys or the auto companies. So just trying to get a head start on how that whole world is going to look like. Thanks.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes, great question. Here's what I'd say, it's very much with the automotive customers themselves and it's very much with the OEMs themselves. And a little bit like if you go back in time, the automotive OEMs, probably in the mid-2,000 to kind of 2010 era started taking a lot more control over their semiconductor strategies and that was really generally around things like infotainment, EV, ADAS and you all of a sudden started seeing these gigantic automotive OEMs with full semiconductor teams. First, it was sort of purchasing and quality, then they started adding design capability and resources, and they've built up over the years quite a capability. So, they take very seriously. They want to control their own destiny when it comes to their future car architecture. So we have a huge head start because of our Ethernet opportunity where were designed in. I have talked couple of times, we're in 16 different OEMs are going to use -- are using or are going to use our Ethernet solutions to provide in car networking and that provided a nice beachhead to go in and also show them all these other types of IPs we have, and now we're getting traction there. And so this is a longer-term opportunity but it can be quite significant in nature, because I would -- the analogy I would give you would be, I think the sea tide shift, we saw in automotive in the kind of mid-2,000s in sort of the infotainment revolution that benefited all kinds of customer companies, all kinds of semiconductor companies. The new wave of automotive suppliers came out of that. One was my prior company but also many others had huge benefit on the Infotainment revolution. I think this data-centric evolution in automotive is going to be just as substantial and really plays to our strengths. And so we look forward to articulating this in more details at our Investor Day. This is a long haul type of opportunity, but we've got enough traction now that it's going to be worth calling out and explaining to investors and the analyst community what we're up to, and what the opportunity could look like, especially for our long-term investors who want to -- who are now asking me hey, this is all great with what you're doing in 5G and what you're doing in cloud, what's next? And so we think there is a story to be told there about what's beyond these other cycles that can drive the company for a long time in the future.\nTore Svanberg: Thank you for that.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri of SMBC. Your line is open.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Thanks for asking squeezing me in. Matt, I just want to go back to the 5G topic, you alluded to Q3 being potentially up. I'm just curious, I mean are you getting better visibility as some of these regions roll out 5G. Is that what's giving you confidence and it looks like it's mostly coming from China, your Q3 commentary. Could you also talk about what's going on in some of the other regions like US or Japan and Korea and also touch upon India because that's been a big market for Samsung historically. Thank you.\nMatthew Murphy: Yes, thanks for the question. So a couple of things. I think one is, given the ramp that's coming and the lead times associated with these products, we have strong backlog today and we have strong bookings in this area, both in Q4, as well as in Q1 that certainly give us confidence that Q2 and Q3 are going to look very, very, very good in this area and the reason at least that we're hearing and that we can infer both from looking at the outside market outside in, as well as from our customers is that primarily -- it's primarily driven by China. But I think the OEMs are all gearing up to your point for the other markets. We see that Japan will start to roll out later this year. There was a concern that, that would get pushed or pause completely due to the Olympics moving out and then COVID-19, but it looks like that you all may not be as robust and we don't know yet, any of these things what the slope will look like but Japan is certainly talking about rollouts starting later this year. The US carriers, once they can start putting people back out and selling things, they're planning on second half in more robust deployments and then India --they've got a -- and the US, by the way, both have pretty important spectrum auctions that needs to get completed we think to really drive 5G. As you know, in India, we still have a strong 4G presence through our lead customer, but really it's 5G that's going to drive the growth. So we -- things may be moving around a little bit, they may be moving out but it's definitely a when, not an if and I think what's nice is, it's hard to handicap these. But what I'd say is, even though some of the other one -- if you looked at where we started the year some regions are probably pushing out a little bit more. And what we thought, but then the China opportunity actually sort of dwarfs that and offsets it. So I think net-net, we do see countries that are going to roll this out. It's going to take time, but it's encouraging to see at least a large deal [ph] really driving this forward and then ultimately that's rippled back to orders on our books that we need to go fulfill. So, appreciate the questions.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt and good afternoon everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the first quarter and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Revenue in the first quarter was $694 million above the middle point of our guidance. Networking represented 57% of our revenue in the first quarter with storage contributing 37%. Revenue from other accounted for 6% of our revenue as we maintain this business consists of products such as print solutions and application processors. As we have stopped investing, so we expect they will continue to decline over time. Our guidance for the second quarter anticipate an approximately 20% sequential decline in revenue for these products. GAAP gross margin was 47.1%, which includes the amortization of both Aquantia and Avera inventory step-up cost. Non-GAAP gross margin was 62.8% of revenue and it reflects the change in product mix compared to our expectations, as Matt discussed earlier. GAAP operating expenses were $423 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $300 million, lower than expected, primarily because of our continued focus on OpEx management and the lower travel expenses due to the COVID -19 impact. I'm pleased that we were able to get to our target for non-GAAP operating expenses three quarters than earlier than expected. And we currently intend to manage OpEx at this level through the rest of the fiscal year. GAAP operating loss was $96 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $136 million or 19.6% of revenue. For the first quarter GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.17. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.18 above the high end of our guidance range. Now turning to our balance sheet, during the quarter, cash flow from operations was $176 million. We returned $65 million to shareholders, through 25 million in share repurchases, and $40 million in dividends. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program midway way through the first quarter as we believe it's prudent to further strengthen our liquidity and the increase our cash balance during the uncertain environment. We'll continue to evaluate the business conditions to decide when to restart the share repurchase a program. We exited the quarter with $660 million in cash and short-term investment, and we have $500 million liquidity available from our undrawn revolver. Our net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.2 times on a trailing 12 month basis. I'm very pleased with our solid financial performance in the first quarter here and in the current environment. We achieved this result by building a strong business model to focus on the growing opportunities in the infrastructure market and continuing to be very disciplined in operating our business to focus on channel investment, while keeping ample liquidity and low debt leverage ratio. Our performance also underpins our strong investment grade credit profile, which provides us with significant financial flexibility to invest in our long-term growth initiatives, so we can emerge from this uncertain time even stronger. Now moving on to our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2021, we are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $720 million, plus or minus 5%. We anticipate our GAAP gross margin will be approximately 50.6%. And our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 63%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $393 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $300 million. We expect net interest expense to be approximately $15 [ph] million and expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. As a result, we anticipate that GAAP loss per diluted share in the range of $0.02 to $0.10 and non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.17 to $0.23. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. Yes, hi, Tim. Thank you. Yes, on the trade impact. I think the impact from Huawei it has happened in the past. So we -- it's already impacted our revenue last year. We actually almost have no Huawei revenue anymore going forward. On the other customers, right now based on our assessment we don't see additional impact. And I think the way to think about it is there -- it's uncertain. But right now we don't see other impact. I'll let Matt answer the 5G question. Yes, so we're very pleased with both acquisitions. I think last earnings call, we said that both Aquantia and Avera have been on track with our expectations, definitely through this year. We think that they are going to perform better than our expectations, just based on the backlog of the order pattern and everything. So overall, very, very pleased with the two acquisitions. Harlan, you are right. Yes. Yes, I'll just add, right. Matt said earlier, we already started production in Q2, which is much earlier than we expected. And then Q3 certainly that's the major ramp. It's going to happen."

            "name": "Matthew Murphy",
            "content": "Thanks. Ashish and good afternoon everyone. During the first quarter of fiscal 2021 we delivered strong financial results and achieved $694 million in revenue, $14 million above the midpoint of guidance. As you may recall, our revenue guidance for the first quarter included an assumption for a 5% headwind from COVID-19. We did in fact experienced some impact on revenue from COVID-19-related issues but stronger-than-expected demand from our data center and 5G infrastructure end markets and our networking business drove consolidated company revenue above the midpoint. Compared to our assumptions when we provided our revenue guidance for the first quarter, the impact of COVID-19 turned out to be greater than expected in our storage business and lower than expected in our networking business. Our GAAP loss per share was $0.17. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.18, above the high end of our guidance range, driven by higher revenue and tight OpEx control. On a sequential basis revenue declined by 3%. However, compared to fourth quarter results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi, revenue for the ongoing business was actually flat on a sequential basis, a very solid result under current conditions, and in what is typically a seasonally weak quarter. I'm extremely pleased with our team's ability to deliver great results despite the massive disruption from the COVID-19 pandemic. The vast majority of our employees have been working from home since early March, earlier than most official shelter-in-place orders were announced, as the health and welfare of our employees and their families was our first priority. Our IT team quickly jumped into action to provide secure, remote access for our 5,000 plus employees. Our Worldwide Operations Group battled through a number of supply chain challenges and met the upside in demand in our networking business. Since the start of work from home, our engineering team has taped out eight new chips, an extremely high level of engineering output in this time frame, on schedule to meet our customers' critical timelines. Our sales team maintained a strong focus on customer communication through this critical time period and continue to drive our growing design win funnel. I have personally experienced a much higher level of direct engagement with the leadership at multiple key customers at the CEO level. Normally, I fly out, meet my counterparts in person a few times a year. But during this crisis we have quickly adopted virtual meetings over video to increase the frequency of communication. We believe the change in cadence reflects our customers' desire to involve us deeply as a trusted partner in solving their need for higher bandwidth and storage in the post COVID-19 world. Our mission as an infrastructure semiconductor solution provider to move, store, process and secure the world's data has never been more relevant and we are seeing strong demand drivers for our products and technology. I truly believe that the culture, we have created at Marvell is enabling our success and has earned us the trust of our employees, customers and partners, and our new brand reflects these values. Celebrating the company's 25 year anniversary, we recently launched Marvell's new brand identity, marking a milestone in our transformation to focus on semiconductor solutions for data infrastructure. This was something we had considered doing soon after we started to pivot the Company in the fall of 2016. But as you know, the company's brand is their reputation, and a reputation is earned. So instead we focused first on creating our new strategy, revamping our culture building, operational excellence and delivering business results. After four years of hard work, we are ready to reveal a new brand that mirrors our culture, which focuses on the substance first. Our brand is built on a foundation of collaboration and partnership with our customers and we are driven by the belief that doing things the right way matters. Essential technology done right reflects our customer-centric approach, to high quality tailored solutions. None of this would be possible without our dedicated employees who have been putting in a lot of extra hours through this unusual period which is likely to persist for a while. Recognizing this challenge we are giving all employees a few extra days off and we are shutting down for a four day recharge weekend in the June. Similarly, we have taken steps to help our contractors and the local community. We are continuing to pay our hourly workers in full as well as the service providers that support our facilities, regardless of whether they can fully perform their duties. In addition Marvell has started a COVID-19 relief fund to support our global communities and provide financial relief to those in need. A portion of the fund is dedicated to matching employee donations, so that employees will also have the opportunity to participate. Until we are able to return to the office in Santa Clara, we plan to donate our entire cafeteria grocery budget to the Second Harvest Food Bank in support of those in need. It is in times of crisis that our values and leadership principles are truly tested. I'm proud of our team and the company we have built. We are in the fortunate position of being able to take care of our people and give back to our communities when it really counts. During and after this crisis, we expect the demand for bandwidth to continue to grow stronger. Major cloud and service providers are facing unprecedented demand for their services as a result of so many people working from home and are scrambling to add capacity to their networks. 5G has become a strategic priority for many nations and also an economic growth driver for economies worldwide. Enterprises are rapidly upgrading their networking infrastructure to support their workforce with remote access to critical business applications and advanced collaboration tools and a secure and scalable environment. We are in the midst of enabling all the key megatrends in 5G, data center cloud, enterprise and automotive as a leading supplier of their infrastructure semiconductors. Over the last few quarters, we have discussed in detail our progress in the carrier market tied to the transition to 5G. Investor focus has been high in this area and I'll provide color on this opportunity in a few moments. For now, I'd like to draw your attention to the cloud data center market, which represents an opportunity for our storage and networking products, similar in magnitude to 5G. This is in addition to our ARM server opportunity, which we have previously outlined as a large multi-billion dollar market for us. We've been working on building our business through organic investments over the past four years, as well as through products and engagements via the Cavium and Avera acquisitions. We are now starting to see the benefits from these efforts and I'm excited to share them with you. In our storage business over the last few years we've been transitioning our HDD business to focus on nearline drives, which are primarily consumed by cloud datacenters and this business has been growing nicely for us, through both our storage controllers and pre-amplifiers. We expect that the 16-terabyte transition this year will drive strong growth for us. Our custom flash controllers are very well suited for cloud customers who have unique storage applications and are looking to disaggregate their SSDs to optimize performance and we pioneered the do-it-yourself model. We also have storage accelerators in evaluation at multiple cloud customers. In virtualized environments and cloud data centers multiple customers can be accessing the same physical storage resources simultaneously. To ensure quality of service, expensive CPU cycles are consumed in managing workloads to ensure that all clients get uninterrupted access to their stored data. Our NVMe storage accelerators enables a better solution by offloading storage IO and freeing up CPU cycles, provisioning bandwidth and ensuring low latency to satisfy service level agreements, which are difficult to achieve with software-only solutions. We expect to see initial production ramps for our storage accelerators starting later this year. In our networking business, our OCTEON compute platform is ideally suited for a variety of offload and acceleration applications in hyperscale datacenters. At GTC 2020 last week. Jensen Huang referred to this category of computing as the DPU, or data processing unit and indicated it would represent the third major pillar of computing in hyperscale data centers after the CPU and GPU. We couldn't agree more. OCTEON is an ideal DPU platform as it is an SoC that combines a scalable multi-core ARM processor, high performance networking in a variety of hardened acceleration engines. As many of you know Cavium was a pioneer in this area. We have continued investing in this segment since the acquisition. Our recently announced OCTEON TX2 was specifically designed for cloud applications such as our LiquidIO programmable smart SmartNIC and LiquidSecurity HSM, or hardware security module product lines. Cloud infrastructure requires optimized hardware for performance, cost and power at scale. Data center operators can achieve these goals by moving specific workloads on the highly optimized off-load engines, even the host server to run more efficiently. Our LiquidIO Smart NICs offload network virtualization, storage protocols, security, distributed firewall, software-defined networks and an network overlay for various cloud datacenter models. Our latest LiquidIO SmartNIC incorporating OCTEON TX2 is ramping now as cloud provider demand is surging. Our LiquidSecurity HSM, which have been adopted by multiple leading cloud providers to provide fully managed cloud hosted protection for cryptographic keys and Crypto-as-a-Service are also ramping. Last year we announced deployments with Amazon, Google and Oracle and I am pleased that we have recently added another large Tier 1 cloud customer. Our ARM-based server processors have been qualified at Microsoft for internal Azure development workloads and we are looking forward to broader adoption in production environments. Our ThunderX3 processor will become available later this year and we continue to engage with additional cloud providers on our solutions. The Avera acquisition brings to us leading edge custom chip design capability, which continues to become more relevant as hyperscalers seek to differentiate and control their own key pieces of silicon. They have very specific needs, and we can combine our leading intellectual property with their own unique IP to most efficiently solve their most complex system design challenges. As these customers continue to design their own silicon, they need a reliable ASIC partner that they can count on for the long haul. Avera was already shipping into the cloud market when we acquired them and they brought over additional cloud design wins which have yet to go into production. The level of engagement with hyperscalers has also continued to grow, after we completed the acquisition and we are seen as a very attractive choice for next generation design decisions. Collectively, we are now building strong cloud franchise, combining our storage networking and processor technology and have the unique ability to deliver products in standard, custom and semi-custom solutions. I'm pleased to report that for the first time we estimate that our revenue from the cloud market exceeded 10% of total company revenue, growing from a fairly small position at the same time last year. We expect that this business will continue to grow with that end market and our own unique product cycles and become another key growth driver for Marvell. Let me now move on to discussing our two businesses in more detail. First, in our networking business revenue during the quarter was $394 million and grew 5% sequentially, significantly above our expectations for a low to mid-single digit decline. Compared to fourth quarter results, adjusted for the divestiture of Wi-Fi growth for the continuing networking business in the first quarter was in the double-digit sequentially. And I'm thrilled with this result. Excellent supply chain execution allowed us to meet strong demand from cloud data centers for our Smart NICs and security adapters that I discussed earlier. Our one gig and 10 gig PHY products experienced robust demand from enterprise data centers as companies continue to upgrade the core of their network operations to deal with higher security and throughput demands. Our wireless infrastructure business grew sequentially and performed better than our expectations of a flattish quarter in strong contrast to the pause or slowdown in 5G deployments mentioned by a number of industry peers for the same time period. We are benefiting from the start of the 5G build out in China where we have content through two of our key customers, who collectively have been awarded about 50% of the share of recently announced contracts. We are currently supplying custom ASICs and standard connectivity products to these customers and are working with them on additional opportunities. In addition, we have a very strong position at Samsung where we have just started to ship our full suite of solutions and expect that their success in Korea, Japan and the US, to drive growth in the coming year. Our custom baseband solution for Nokia is progressing very well through qualification and we expect to start production later this year. Collectively, we are designed into the latest generation of base stations in to multiple OEMs, which are expected to be powering all key geographies over several years. We are still at the very beginning of the industry transition from 4G to 5G and look forward to driving significant revenue growth from this end market. Demand from the enterprise campus end market remained stable on a sequential basis, a good outcome under current market conditions. When we start to come out of the COVID-19 crisis, we are looking forward to the deployment of Wi-Fi 6 which requires higher speed Ethernet connections. We expect this adoption will drive growth for our multi-gig Ethernet products as we have a very strong design win position across most leading OEMs for enterprise Wi-Fi access points. And we also have a strong position on campus switches, which aggregate traffic from these access points. We recently taped out additional products from our recently announced OCTEON TX2 family of ARM-based infrastructure processors, including our flagship highest performance solution featuring 36 cores which can deliver up to 200 gigabits per second of packet processing for the most demanding applications. We also tapped out our Fusion-based processor, customized for massive MIMO applications for our leading wireless customer ahead of schedule. Our customer will be using this solution in their high volume massive MIMO SKUs and we expect to be ramping into production in the fall. The design win funnel for OCTEON processors is continuing to expand with a broad set of Tier 1 networking and high-end security firewall OEMs. The OCTEON platform is an extensive ARM-based embedded processor product family which can scale from four cores at the low end to 36 cores on the high end, all on a common software framework. This is a critical advantage for Marvell when engaging with Tier 1 networking OEMs who want to partner with solution providers able to support their broad range of products, allowing massive software reuse. We are deep into the development already of our next generation OCTEON family based on advanced node process technology. The combined strength of our recent OCTEON announcements and aggressive roadmap is resonating very well with key OEMs. In our emerging automotive business, there are encouraging signs that auto production is restarting in multiple geographies. And if this happens, we expect to start ramping Ethernet switches and PHYs in the second half of our fiscal year for the designs we had one in model year 2021 vehicles. We expect to grow our automotive footprint over the next few years through our Ethernet connectivity products, but we see an even bigger opportunity for Marvell as cars continue to evolve towards becoming truly connected platforms. Traditional point to point solutions in cars are heading towards zonal architectures, very similar to modern enterprise networking, where endpoints connect to centralized compute and storage resources over a secure Ethernet backbone. We believe that we have all the pieces in place to be a leader in the market for this evolution, low power and high performance ARM-based embedded processors, proven security IP, automotive grade gigabit and multi-gigabit Ethernet connectivity, advanced storage technology and a solution delivery model which can span from standard product to full custom. We will discuss this broader initiative in more detail at our Investor Day in October. Let me now discuss the outlook for our networking business. After a very strong first quarter we expect our networking business to continue to grow in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 and project revenue to increase in the low-single digits sequentially. We expect this growth to be driven by 5G wireless infrastructure deployments and our carrier end market. Looking out to the third quarter, based on our recent bookings and firm backlog position, we expect our 5G business to continue to ramp, strongly. Turning now to our storage business, storage revenue for the first quarter was $259 million, a double-digit sequential decline, worse than our expectations for a mid-single digit decline. This was due to multiple manufacturing facilities in Southeast Asia coming under new shelter-in-place orders in connection with COVID-19 as the quarter progressed, impacting production of fiber channel adapters and hard disk drives. Our SSD controller business, in contrast remained resilient and grew sequentially, driven by higher shipments in to data center applications. Looking to the second quarter, we expect our storage business to start to recover from COVID-19 impacts on the supply chain. Although a full recovery is more likely in our third quarter. We have started initial shipments of our custom SSD controllers for system level applications in our second fiscal quarter. As a result, we are projecting storage revenue growth of approximately 10% sequentially for the second quarter. This custom SSD controller is based on our new PCIe Gen4 architecture and was developed in close collaboration with our customer to create a storage controller uniquely tailored to their application. I'm very pleased with our strong engineering and operations execution, which has enabled us to start early shipments to meet our customers' production schedule. We expect the storage controller to ramp into high volume in our third fiscal quarter. In closing, we have a strategy focused on semiconductor solutions for data infrastructure. The critical nature of that infrastructure became even more evident during the current crisis, as it keeps people connected, businesses running and information flowing. Our pivot to data infrastructure wasn't an accident, and is a direct result of our decisive strategic portfolio actions over the last four years. Our strategy is in place. We are executing well and we have the right team and technology to exceed our customers' expectations. Our booking and backlog trends are very healthy, especially in 5G cloud and custom SSD, and support our expectations of driving overall company growth beyond the second quarter. We of course will continue to closely monitor demand signals from our customers in this uncertain environment. We remain confident in our ability to continue to benefit over the long term from the macro trends I outlined during this call. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Sure, yes. And Tim just to clarify on the trade side, yes, as Jean mentioned we felt primarily the brunt of that impact, about a year ago when the initial restrictions were put in place. And so we've worked through that issue. I think the other thing you may be asking is, what's the kind of overall picture if there's an impact to that particular customer in the 5G space and will other vendors take share, will that be a tailwind for Marvell? And the answer to that is in our current base case assumption we're assuming no share shifts. We have strong position at the other four, but certainly to the extent that there are SHARE movements within the 5G players that would be to the benefit of other customers that we supply, that would be a good thing for us. Related to that was your was your second part of the question, which was on the long-term opportunity. Yes, it's actually a little bit larger. It was $600 million when we standalone Marvell, and then when we did the acquisition of Avera, we added another $150 million of run rate business coming over. So, that really framed the whole opportunity at $750 million. We still feel very good about that as you heard in my prepared remarks, as well as even some of the comments from last quarter, we continue to have very strong design win momentum there and content increase at a number of the key players. And we continue to be heavily engaged and we're still in the early stages of this and we hope to update that figure at some point in the future, but just clearly based on what we've won already there is $750 million that's in the pipeline. Probably a little bit more if you look at the Nokia partnership that we announced last quarter. So that's very much on track. Thanks for the question by the way. Sure, yes, Gary, this is Matt. I'll take that. So we're off to a great start in our first quarter. As I indicated last quarter, there was -- we had a lot of momentum in our business exiting the year. I would also give you a higher level framework to start with, which is remember that the overall semiconductor industry in 2019 went through the third largest down cycle we've seen in the last 25 years, primarily on the back of the trade tensions. And so coming into calendar '20, just kind of broadly speaking inventories were low in the customer base and supply chain, certainly even at Marvell our own inventories through our channel and our customers were low. And so the demand that we had seen exiting the year even before COVID-19 hit has continued and the drivers we see in our business are, we think very sustainable. Certainly in the two areas that you mentioned, we're at the early stages of 5G and you've got the China market, that is expecting to have a very robust demand this year. That's all very sort of publicly announced, and we're at the beginning stages of that. We expect other regions to continue to follow, which would be very good for our customers. On the cloud side I think that demand trend is certainly here to stay. And while there has been some talk about potential digestion and things of that nature, at least from our lens as Marvell, we have very unique product cycles that we mentioned, both on our Smart NICs are brand new LiquidIO III SmartNIC product which is ramping very strongly. Our LiquidSecurity products, storage, I think there is a strong view on the nearline side that, that will be a very good year. So overall, at least from Marvell, we think those are very sustainable. Last comment I would make is in Q1 we had the additional benefit of some very good enterprise strength, primarily and enterprise data center and that helped us as well. So I think we've got a nice setup of various moving pieces, but certainly from a sustainability standpoint, we see 5G and Cloud really driving our business this year, through the remainder of the year. Well, it's--- in -- a little bit started and helped us even in the first quarter is that again, we'll see more in Q2 with really we see a very, very strong Q3, our Q3 for that particular business. And I would say that's really when the volume starts. So we're still in the early stages of that build with some of that comprehended in our Q2, but a much stronger outlook for Q3 and beyond. Sure. Hey CJ, I'll start with that and then I'll ask Jean to add if she'd like to. So couple of things to note, we definitely have indigenous China revenue. We -- prior to the entity list issues Huawei was our number one customer in China and I think that's been very well-telegraphed what's going on there. As you heard my commentary, we've ended up gaining some share at their biggest competitor in China. And so that's going to service really well in the 5G ramp. And then additionally we supply a number of other OEMs. We haven't broken that number out. But what I'd say is if you look at our historical Qs, they just have shipped to numbers, now like 50%, 47% and that's obviously way overstated because that reflects primarily contract manufacturing activity in the region. So, we've got I think exposure in the right places there both -- in 5G as well as some of the key enterprise OEMs there, and then we have some distribution as well. So I think our business is reasonably diversified outside of the first customer I mentioned. Yes, great. Let me start with Q3 and then I'll move to the over-ordering question as well. So on Q3, just to be clear at the highest level, what I said in my prepared remarks, was that we see -- we do see overall company revenue increasing from Q2 to Q3. At this point given the visibility we have. That's overall company and that's driven by primarily our networking business, which is 5G and Cloud, but also by since custom SSD opportunity I mentioned. And so we see strength actually beyond Q2, both in our networking business and in our storage business. On the subject of double ordering and the concerns out there, look, I a bit on this rodeo for a while. I've seen various shocks to the system. And then the resultant supply-demand imbalances. And I'm very acutely sensitive to those, in watching those like a hawk. From our point of view, I think the interesting dynamic on this one, Vivek, as I mentioned earlier is that the industry exiting '19 was coming out of a very severe downturn where customer inventory levels were low. And so, certainly, there has been, -- there has been a -- now they probably over did it and I think even certainly without COVID-19, I think we were going to see even probably stronger demand, as we indicated for last quarter. So that's one part of the set up. And the second is, we've. I mean we've, at least in Marvell, we really over-indexed on this in terms of spending time on this matter, and trying to look at all the customer ordering patterns. Does their market share add up to more than 100% and how much do we think is buffer versus not. And the end conclusion is I'm very comfortable with the current forecast we have and also backlog and order position that we've got. And I just make another note, which is as well. Just to hedge it a little bit, I mean we've been running our distribution Inventory well below kind of our target levels. And part of that is just to ensure that we maintain integrity in the demand side and make sure what we're shipping is needed, but all things point to an aggregate. We don't see a double ordering issue. Final point I'd make is we haven't been afraid to call those out. I mean if you look at the third quarter of 2018 calendar, this was right when the trade war -- the tariffs were being announced and I mean, if you're probably remember this we had a 29% year-over-year - year growth in that quarter in our Marvell's networking business, and we were actually the first company to kind of point out. We think that this is not normal, right and that we shouldn't expect this to continue and we tried to plan our business around that. So we've been forthcoming when we see it. At this point we see the supply demand balance, at least in our view to be pretty much in line, but we are paying close attention to it. Thanks. Yes, and I'll just add to back that up. We had a very strong Q4 and Q1. And so the six months that we've owned both of them, we've gained a lot of confidence that not only are those the right acquisitions to do, but the level of top line contribution was going to be not only right where we thought, but probably given all the dynamics I mentioned, with strength in cloud and strength in 5G that is benefiting certainly Avera. And then on Aquantia, as I mentioned, we've had very good enterprise strength in some of these segments. So we do see both of those probably performing better than we had indicated back at the time of announcement for calendar '20. Thanks. Yes. I'll take this, Jean, and then you can add. So yes, no, you're right and in fact, the way to think about it is any -- all of these DIY opportunities are by design proprietary and sole source in nature. And they -- to your point, they typically incorporate pretty substantial and rich IP from Marvell. And then as a result of that we're able to command better ASPs and also add an additional functionality above and beyond what you would sort of normally think of a standard SSD controller is being valued at. So, I think it's a great combination of -- in any of these DIY efforts that we have going on and there are several of them where we have very close collaboration with the OEM to find really something that's very special and unique for what they need. And then, the result of that is they can get pretty significant performance benefits across a wide variety of applications, when it comes to flash-based storage. So yes, proprietary sole-source and on track to ramp. Thanks, Harlan. Sure. Yes, thanks for the question. Ross and I'm glad you brought it up, I mean we definitely wanted to spend time on it. I think if you look at the last year or so, we've been very focused and certainly from an investor point of view, the demand for questions and information and the opportunity for Marvell at least has really been framed around 5G. As I mentioned that continues to be not only a great opportunity, we're actually starting to ship. And so it's nice to see the results now catching up with the thesis. So very pleased about that. And so the thing that's really come together though in parallel, as we did the various portfolio moves last year and even going back farther kind of the Marvell organic investments that we've made, we have been very focused on cloud and hyperscale. We do see that as a big SAM and a big opportunity. And so what's -- we thought it was an appropriate time to talk about that and break it out because a lot of things have come together in that business is now ramping. And it's actually strong in both our networking and storage side and we see both of those opportunities as being quite significant. That's excluding ARM server. I mean ARM server, you just dump that one on top of it, but even ex ARM server, we see the SAM for our networking and storage products, and now the combined company with all the moves we've made as being an equivalently large opportunity as 5G. And while cloud spend can be lumpy, we certainly have that in other markets. The carrier market isn't exactly the hallmark of stability. That thing certainly can move around as everybody that's been involved in base stations knows. So there can be some lumpiness to the business, but at the same time, because of the breadth of the products we sell into that market in cloud and even if you look at 5G, it's the same thing, because we sell to a wide range of OEMs with a wide suite of technology, we do -- we are able to smooth out some of the lumpiness. But I think the key thing I would point to is both businesses now are becoming significant for Marvell, both businesses, we expect to grow this year and beyond. And I think it's a horse race between the two on which one can be bigger, if you look out over several, several years. And so that's really, Ross why we want to spend the time on it. We think it's a pretty major opportunity, but when it was so small a year ago before we did Aquantia -- I'm sorry, before we did -- we had Avera plus some of our own designs hadn't kicked in. We didn't want to do that but it reminds me of -- it when I was at Maxim and we had a very nascent emerging automotive business, and then there was a point where we had an analyst and we decided to break it out, because it crested over 10% and then it was off to the races. So, I think those are some of the -- some additional considerations for you to think about on our cloud business beyond my prepared remarks. So, I'll give you both sides of the coin. I think on the one hand you could take the argument you just said, which is what we see today, by the way, that things appear to be stabilizing as factories are coming online and countries are reopening and so forth. At the same time though, I mean let's just take a big step back right? The whole world and environment is highly uncertain and the rate at which thing hit us, I think caught everybody off guard and so I wouldn't read too much into it other than we widened the range last quarter. And just out of the abundance of caution, there is no reason to tighten at this point, but we don't see anything -- differently than you mentioned at the beginning. I mean, we -- it seems like we've got our demand -- we've got our demand drivers. We have seen strong orders. We've got good backlog position those types of things. So we have confidence in our business, but it's really just around the broader level uncertainty and I think our range by the way is very consistent actually with a lot of other semi hears or I we'll probably leave it a little bit wider until we -- the world seems to stabilize. Yes. Yes. Sure, John. Yes, happy to answer that. And I have seen that commentary, and I think it does have a lot to do with what you mentioned. In particular, probably the analog-mixed-signal guys who have a much broader customer set, highly distribution-oriented consumer and industrial type of exposure in automotive as well, where those types of market seem to have been hit very, very hard. I think our market mix is clearly benefiting us at this point in our strategy that we really have been driving for the last several years, I think is become extremely pertinent in this new world. And so I think we're quite different than maybe some of the other broader based folks who -- I don't blame them for being extremely conservative. And I understand those dynamics, that they may face, but I'd say with us setting in. I mean we also --through the mix changes, because we're not selling as much into consumer anymore. As an example, the lead times that we get are solid. Our terms and conditions are quite solid. The backlog coverage we get is, especially with Avera coming in and think of it as Avera coming in and Aquantia and Wi-Fi going out, and you swap that sort of consumer for infrastructure you're just getting a much better backlog position. And on top of that, we've got the channel quite lean and we're also carrying some delinquency higher than we normally do. And so that gives which is -- which means we've got -- we've got backlog that's out in Q3 that customers would like us to ship into Q2 and that has increased relative to where we normally run it. And so I think that -- those are some of the other data points, John, that give us give us comfort in the guide as well as just our starting backlog position is has been higher than most quarters since we've been here. Yes, great, thanks Chris. Great question. So first point on DPU I thought that was really, really well done by our colleagues over at NVIDIA and it's certainly resonated. I think that was the clearest way that I've seen anybody explain what these products do and I think the market in general has gotten confused over with the SmartNIC is on a NIC kind of a commodity thing and it's sort like fungible and liquid and it just -- I think. -- this is a much crisper way to describe it. And so and it certainly fits as you point out, kind of a key IP and a key area that the Cavium really pioneered. And so with respect to our smart NIC offerings that -- I think kind of it's consistent with the question that Ross asked. We spent a lot of time talking about 5G last year but very quietly, we've been continuing those roadmaps. And so that is ramping, it's highly sustainable. We -- and it's -- and we're engaged with multiple OEMs between the ramps that we're getting plus new opportunities and engagements and I actually think we're in, probably one of the best positions of any semiconductor company to truly tailor and optimize solutions based around the smart NIC type of architecture. Because we have all the pieces right. We have the latest generation OCTEON core which is highly programmable, we have network connectivity in Ethernet. We have security, we have access and development in investment in the most advanced node process technologies. And we have ASIC capability, which is a trend that we see as well where some of the large hyperscalers are just saying, let's go skip over a LiquidIO type of solution. Let's go directly to our very special thing that we want and we think we can provide a similar type of solution there just like we do in our co-partner model on baseband where we contribute a big chunk of the IP. The customer can also contribute, we stitch it together, they get exactly what they want. We can do it very quickly, without the customer having to hire a gigantic design team and take three years. So, I think it's a very compelling opportunity, Chris, both on the current ramps we're seeing on the latest generation products as well as our roadmap and the ability to customize and drive this product area forward. Thanks for the question. Yes, thanks. See you. Sure, Joe. Yes, I think the, the world, the whole thunder investment that we're making has continued to be really focused down. I mean if you went back to sort of pre-acquisition of caveat I think there was a view that said there is a very large market for this, we can sell to a whole ton of customers across a whole bunch of different applications and serve a number of workloads and go head to head with more general-purpose type x86. And really the direction that we've taken is to really focus the product down and tailor it really around a handful of key vendor -- key customers in the cloud area, and within that as an example in our announcement publicly we had with Microsoft, where we are the first property that we're [ph] in is in Azure storage. And the way we developed and defined the product was really ideal for that application but we can certainly do a high level of customization for these hyperscalers because they know exactly what they need. And so we do see opportunities in expanding in the more compute-oriented applications and workloads but that's sort of in the future. But again, I'd sort of transition the Thunder story just to bridge everybody from. hey, it's broad based, it's going to go to take on x86 and take on the world across all kinds of applications to really the evolution over the last few years under a more focused effort to really focus around the hyperscale opportunity and tailor it specifically to those customers and what they need. Yes, thanks. Yes, great question. Here's what I'd say, it's very much with the automotive customers themselves and it's very much with the OEMs themselves. And a little bit like if you go back in time, the automotive OEMs, probably in the mid-2,000 to kind of 2010 era started taking a lot more control over their semiconductor strategies and that was really generally around things like infotainment, EV, ADAS and you all of a sudden started seeing these gigantic automotive OEMs with full semiconductor teams. First, it was sort of purchasing and quality, then they started adding design capability and resources, and they've built up over the years quite a capability. So, they take very seriously. They want to control their own destiny when it comes to their future car architecture. So we have a huge head start because of our Ethernet opportunity where were designed in. I have talked couple of times, we're in 16 different OEMs are going to use -- are using or are going to use our Ethernet solutions to provide in car networking and that provided a nice beachhead to go in and also show them all these other types of IPs we have, and now we're getting traction there. And so this is a longer-term opportunity but it can be quite significant in nature, because I would -- the analogy I would give you would be, I think the sea tide shift, we saw in automotive in the kind of mid-2,000s in sort of the infotainment revolution that benefited all kinds of customer companies, all kinds of semiconductor companies. The new wave of automotive suppliers came out of that. One was my prior company but also many others had huge benefit on the Infotainment revolution. I think this data-centric evolution in automotive is going to be just as substantial and really plays to our strengths. And so we look forward to articulating this in more details at our Investor Day. This is a long haul type of opportunity, but we've got enough traction now that it's going to be worth calling out and explaining to investors and the analyst community what we're up to, and what the opportunity could look like, especially for our long-term investors who want to -- who are now asking me hey, this is all great with what you're doing in 5G and what you're doing in cloud, what's next? And so we think there is a story to be told there about what's beyond these other cycles that can drive the company for a long time in the future. Yes, thanks for the question. So a couple of things. I think one is, given the ramp that's coming and the lead times associated with these products, we have strong backlog today and we have strong bookings in this area, both in Q4, as well as in Q1 that certainly give us confidence that Q2 and Q3 are going to look very, very, very good in this area and the reason at least that we're hearing and that we can infer both from looking at the outside market outside in, as well as from our customers is that primarily -- it's primarily driven by China. But I think the OEMs are all gearing up to your point for the other markets. We see that Japan will start to roll out later this year. There was a concern that, that would get pushed or pause completely due to the Olympics moving out and then COVID-19, but it looks like that you all may not be as robust and we don't know yet, any of these things what the slope will look like but Japan is certainly talking about rollouts starting later this year. The US carriers, once they can start putting people back out and selling things, they're planning on second half in more robust deployments and then India --they've got a -- and the US, by the way, both have pretty important spectrum auctions that needs to get completed we think to really drive 5G. As you know, in India, we still have a strong 4G presence through our lead customer, but really it's 5G that's going to drive the growth. So we -- things may be moving around a little bit, they may be moving out but it's definitely a when, not an if and I think what's nice is, it's hard to handicap these. But what I'd say is, even though some of the other one -- if you looked at where we started the year some regions are probably pushing out a little bit more. And what we thought, but then the China opportunity actually sort of dwarfs that and offsets it. So I think net-net, we do see countries that are going to roll this out. It's going to take time, but it's encouraging to see at least a large deal [ph] really driving this forward and then ultimately that's rippled back to orders on our books that we need to go fulfill. So, appreciate the questions."

A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the recap of the exceptional results Marvell delivered in fiscal 2022, an absolutely pivotal year for the company. We saw a substantial increase in design wins, the completion of two significant acquisitions, and strong revenue growth with great momentum in all our businesses. Our 5-nanometer technology platform, along with the rest of our data-centric IP portfolio, proved to be a key enabler for winning new opportunities in all of our focus markets. Our sales and product teams did a tremendous job securing new sockets and drove a record level of design wins in fiscal 2022, a big step up from the prior year. Fiscal 2022 was also a breakout year for our cloud optimized silicon platform, winning a sizable number of important sockets, which we expect will drive significant revenue for the company going forward. We remain focused on extending our leadership in process technology and advanced packaging. Our engineering teams are driving the architecture and design of our complex analog and mixed-signal IP to 3-nanometers. They are also advancing chiplet and 3D packaging technologies to support the integration of multiple advanced process nodes inside a single package. During the year, we completed the integration of Inphi, a transformational acquisition that substantially increased our participation in the fast-growing cloud data center market. The Marvell and Inphi team share very similar values founded on engineering excellence, innovation, and a passion for our customers' success. The teams have integrated exceptionally well across the company and are jointly taking our capabilities to new heights. Inphi's position at the core of cloud data centers has given the team unique insights into next-generation network architectures. The Inphi team has developed deep relationships with Tier 1 cloud customers, which has been instrumental in unlocking additional opportunities for the combined company, including the success of our cloud optimized silicon platform. The transaction, which was accretive to non-GAAP earnings within the first full quarter after close has been a resounding success, delivering revenue in fiscal 2022 above our deal model. We further complemented our cloud business with the Innovium acquisition, adding their leading cloud optimized switches to Marvell's feature-rich enterprise and carrier switch portfolio. The Innovium team is fully integrated and are leveraging Marvell's 5-nanometer technology platform and extensive SerDes IP to accelerate the road map for our next-generation 51.2 T switches. This development is closely aligned with our electrooptics DSP roadmap to provide customers with a complete solution optimized for power and performance. The combined Marvell and Innovium Ethernet switch portfolios are proving very attractive to data center customers, among them, a new design win at a Tier 1 cloud customer in Asia. We are also engaged with multiple additional customers and are looking forward to further expanding our footprint in this fast-growing market. Moving on to revenue. In fiscal 2022, revenue grew 50% year-on-year to $4.46 billion driven by robust demand for our products. The organic Marvell business and the acquired Inphi business were both strong contributors to growth. Our results reflect our success in the cloud, 5G, and automotive end markets, which collectively doubled in revenue from the prior year. Our enterprise networking end market also had a phenomenal year with revenue growing 43% year-over-year. Later in the call today, you will hear more details about the start of an extended period of infrastructure refreshes in the enterprise market. We expect that these, combined with share and content gains from our merchant products, will produce enduring growth in our enterprise business. And not only that, you will also hear me talk about a new driver of revenue growth in the enterprise networking market. Shifting gears to our fourth quarter, we delivered a record $1.34 billion in revenue, growing 11% sequentially and 68% year-over-year. Revenue exceeded the midpoint of guidance with all end markets growing sequentially and year-over-year. Of particular note, cloud and enterprise networking delivered stronger than projected contributions. Cloud, 5G, and auto collectively increased to 40% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. We exited fiscal 2022 with record bookings momentum and opportunities for accelerated growth across our business going forward. We continue to win in the market as our customer look to expand the scope of their engagements with Marvell. Our operations team continues to secure capacity, and we\u2019re tightly engaged with our strategic suppliers. Growth in demand continues to outstrip increases in supply. And as a result, our delinquency has continued to grow. We are working closely with our suppliers to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the fourth quarter was $574 million, growing 15% sequentially and 113% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance. The majority of the growth was from cloud driven by robust demand from hyperscale customers. Let me note that our on-premise data center business also grew sequentially and year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, sequential and year-over-year revenue growth was broad-based with multiple product lines contributing to the excellent results. We expect the demand outlook from cloud customers to remain strong, and we are also looking forward to the ramp of new design wins. At our Investor Day, we discussed our expectations for $400 million in incremental revenue contributions in fiscal 2024 from new cloud optimized wins, doubling to $800 million in fiscal 2025. Development of these programs is well on track with several products slated to enter production later this year and start contributing meaningful revenue. Since that update, we have won multiple additional cloud optimized designs. Similar to the wins in prior quarters, these chips are for a variety of networking and compute offload or acceleration functions in cloud data centers. We are expecting revenue contributions from these new wins to start as early as fiscal 2024 and then ramp more substantially over time. Both of these wins are incremental to what we had discussed at our Investor Day. In aggregate, in fiscal 2022, we have won over a dozen cloud optimized programs across multiple Tier 1 cloud customers. A significant number of these designs are for custom DPU implementations, reflecting the increase in the attach rate of DPUs inside cloud data centers. We expect this trend to accelerate in next-generation architectures. We are confident that we are uniquely positioned to win these opportunities with our leading portfolio of compute, networking, security, storage and high-speed electro-optics IP, all of them delivered on our cloud optimized 5-nanometer platform. In our electro-optics business, we are continuing to innovate. We are aggressively driving the road map to improve power performance in leading-edge technology nodes with our next-generation products. We have begun volume shipments of our 800-gig PAM4 DSPs, enabling customers to start deployment of 800-gig optical modules in cloud data center and AI network applications. We are confident that we are the industry's first PAM4 DSP supplier to achieve this production milestone. Let me now discuss a new product line we just announced for the emerging active electrical cable market. This opens up another avenue of growth for us in the data center, leveraging our core DSP expertise. Today, our PAM4 products are primarily deployed in optical modules, used in cloud data centers for long-reach, switch-to-switch connections. In the same data centers, short-reach connections between switches, between server to top of rack switches and in AI interconnects have traditionally used passive electrical cables for speeds of up to 50 gig per lane. None of these requires advanced signal processing today. However, in next-generation cloud data centers, AI, ML and other data-intensive workloads are pushing these short-reach connections to higher 100 gig per lane throughput. At these speeds, passive electrical cables have significant reach and performance limitations. To overcome these challenges, the industry is turning to active electrical cables, referred to as ADCs, which require advanced DSPs. To meet that demand, Marvell has introduced the industry's first 400-gig and 800-gig DSPs for the ADC market, based on our leading PAM4 SerDes technology. Our unique business model allows us to work with both cloud customers, as well as all leading cable manufacturers to drive an open ecosystem. Our industry-leading DSPs have enabled major cable vendors to complete development of their first ADC solutions. We are also working with multiple cloud operators to take advantage of this new growth opportunity. On the storage side, our leading process technology platform and PCIe road map execution continues to drive new design wins for our data center SSD controllers. During the quarter, we secured designs with our PCIe Gen 5 controllers at two additional NAND OEMs, making a total of three who are adopting the Marvell solution. Looking ahead, our team is also pushing forward with our PCIe Gen 6 development, and our customers are very excited about our road map. Moving on to our expectations for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 from our data center end market, we project revenue to grow sequentially in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis and more than double year-over-year. We are expecting another strong performance led by cloud customers across a broad range of products. We are also projecting the start of a strong ramp of our 400-gig ZR data center interconnect products. In fact, we are expecting this ramp to drive our DCI revenue to a new record in the first quarter, eclipsing the peak we had achieved in the 100-gig cycle. Even at this very early stage of industry adoption, we are excited to see the rapid growth of 400 ZR, and we expect to see a lot more growth over time. Looking forward, we see ongoing growth in the data center, including revenue contribution starting from the new cloud-optimized product ramps to drive another step-up in our data center revenue in the second half of this fiscal year and beyond. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $241 million, growing 12% sequentially and 45% year-over-year. These results were driven by our 5G business, which delivered substantial revenue growth of over 30% sequentially, exceeding our guidance. We benefited from the broader rollout of 5G technology and product ramps at multiple base station customers. Marvell recently announced a collaboration with Dell on their new suite of telecom solutions to help service providers enable their transformation to open cloud-native networks. This offering includes a codeveloped open RAN accelerator card using our proven OCTEON Fusion baseband silicon to deliver in-line 5G layer 1 processing. We continue to see strong traction on our 5G technology platform, resulting in another key 5-nanometer design win for a radio ASIC at a Tier 1 base station customer. Following the strong step-up in the fourth quarter, we expect revenue from the carrier end market to continue to grow in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We are projecting revenue to grow in the low single-digits sequentially, while year-over-year growth is expected to remain strong at over 40%. Moving on to our enterprise networking and end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $263 million, growing 6% sequentially and 64% year-over-year, another strong performance from this large and growing Marvell business. As you heard in the opening remarks, this end market is going through an inflection. Hybrid work is here to stay, but the current networking infrastructure was never designed to support this flexible, seamless, connect from anywhere, immersive, and high video usage environment. Companies are now embarking upon an extended period of refreshing their infrastructure, becoming borderless, enabling new digital capabilities, massively increasing bandwidth, building redundancy, and beefing up security. You will also remember from our prior discussions that we have been winning designs with our refreshed products over several years in this end market. These wins have typically come with higher Marvell content, driven by new features such as multi-gig Ethernet and MACsec. As the upgrade cycle in the enterprise networking market gains momentum, we are beginning to see our customers starting to ship their new platforms where we have higher share and increased content. Looking forward, we expect enterprises will continue to modernize their networks. And as a result, we project ongoing growth to continue from this end market.  Let me now discuss a new source of growth for Marvell in this end market, custom silicon. We have a very successful custom business in the carrier end market and are also building a large revenue stream from hyperscalers with our cloud optimized products. We are now enabling the enterprise networking market to take advantage of our advanced technology platform. I would like to point out that these designs frequently pull through additional Marvell content across a number of our product lines. Our pipeline of opportunities is growing and we see custom silicon becoming another leg to the enterprise networking tool, adding to the ongoing growth from our merchant products. We expect revenue from custom products and enterprise networking to grow sharply to well over $100 million in fiscal 2023. In aggregate, we expect a very durable period of high growth from enterprise networking to strongly complement our cloud, 5G, and auto pillars. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect growth to accelerate in our enterprise networking end market. We are projecting revenue to be up sequentially in the mid-teens on a percentage basis and year-over-year growth over 70%. Its growth outlook reflects our expectations of higher supply to support our product ramps and the ongoing enterprise infrastructure refresh cycle. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market, revenue for the fourth quarter was $79 million, growing 19% sequentially and 134% year-over-year. Strong revenue growth in this end market is being driven by higher adoption of our Brightlane Ethernet solutions in a growing number of vehicles from multiple OEMs. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting strong sequential growth to continue from auto and a flattish outlook for our industrial business. As a result, for the auto and industrial end market, we are projecting sequential revenue growth in the high single digits on a percentage basis, while year-over-year growth is expected above 80%. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $185 million, growing 2% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Growth in this end market is being driven by our SSD controllers, shipping into consumer-oriented platforms such as game consoles. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue to be flattish on a sequential basis and continue to grow year-over-year, approximately in the double digits on a percentage basis. In closing, we delivered record results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022, growing revenue well-above our long-term target model. We expect this momentum to continue. Marvell is uniquely positioned to benefit from the three most important growth opportunities in semiconductors; cloud, 5G and automotive. The transformation in the enterprise end market is also becoming another continuing growth driver for Marvell. We expect secular growth to continue from all our end markets, further supported by our large and growing pipeline of secured design wins, which will drive incremental revenue. We are also working to make sure that we grow in a responsible and sustainable manner. Over the past year, Marvell has taken meaningful action on evolving our environmental, social and governance strategy, setting new goals and increasing transparency. We've committed to achieving net-zero emissions as a company and are setting a science based target to put us on track to reach this goal. Building a more inclusive and diverse workforce is another important area of focus, and we have increased our outreach to traditionally underrepresented talent. I would encourage investors to visit our new ESG website to review the goals we've outlined and our progress to date. On behalf of Marvell's Board and leadership team, I thank our valued employees for the outstanding results they've helped deliver in the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal year 2022. Ours is a highly resilient team that has stayed focused and outperformed through an extended period of challenges and uncertainty. This is an exciting time for our company as we've hit an inflection point in our growth cycle and are seeing strong momentum in our businesses across the Board. I look forward to continuing to work alongside our exceptional Marvell team to address the numerous opportunities in front of us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nJean Hu: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our fiscal year 2022 results. We are very pleased with our performance in fiscal 2022, delivering record revenue and profitability while continuing to aggressively invest to drive strong long-term growth from the data infrastructure market. Revenue grew significantly by 50% year-on-year to $4.46 billion. GAAP gross margin was 46.3% and the GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.53. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 64.9%, expanding by 160 basis points, reflecting the increase in value and the differentiation we provide to our customers. Revenue growth and gross margin expansion, combined with strong operating leverage from our business model, drove robust growth in earnings for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 860 basis points from 24.2% to 32.8%. And non-GAAP earnings per share grew 71% year-on-year to $1.57. Moving on to our financial results for the fourth quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.343 billion, exceeding the middle point of our guidance, growing 11% sequentially and 68% year-over-year. Data center was our largest end market, driving 43% of consolidated revenue. Enterprise networking was next largest with 19% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 18%, consumer at 14% and auto industrial at 6%. GAAP gross margin was 51.1%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $877 million or 65.3% of revenue, another record driven by rich product mix, reflecting our strong IP position and the leading product portfolio. GAAP operating expenses were $652 million and include the cost of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal settlements and acquisition and divestiture-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $390 million, at the low end of our guidance range. GAAP operating income was $35 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $487 million, up 115% from a year ago, growing significantly faster than revenue. We achieved a record of 36.3% non-GAAP operating margin, an improvement of 790 basis points from the prior year, reflects the strong operating leverage in our business model. For the fourth quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $0.01. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.50, up 72% year-over-year, exceeding the middle point of our guidance. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $346 million. I'm pleased with our strong cash flow generation while investing significantly in working capital to support strong revenue growth. We returned 51 million to shareholders through cash dividends. As of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $614 million, and our long-term debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times. We are confident that we are on track to achieve our targeted gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio of two times by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, at which time we expect to restart share repurchase. Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $720 million. $39 million of this inventory balance is from Innovium, due to purchase price accounting. We anticipate amortizing this step-up over the next two quarters. We have also increased our working process inventory to support the rapid growth in revenue we are forecasting. In summary, the Marvell team executed exceptionally well, delivering accelerated top line growth and strong earnings expansion significantly faster than revenue growth. Turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.425 billion, plus or minus 3%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 49.6% to 50.6%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 65% to 66%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $672 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $430 million to $435 million. For the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP tax rate of 6%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 848 million. And our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 863 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.03 per share on the low end to an income of $0.05 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.48 to $0.54. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. You may now go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Matt, it seems like you're ahead of plan, and I'm wondering if you could update us on your fiscal 2023 growth forecast. And then also, as you look to fiscal 2024, I know you said you're going to grow more than 30% this year. But it seems like you can do better than that. Now, it seems like you're getting a little more supply. And then also, I think you had hinted that, well, maybe you can grow somewhere in that range also for fiscal 2024, because the fiscal 2023 guidance didn't include any work on -- in delinquencies. So I'm just kind of wondering if you can update us on those. It sounds like you'd be incrementally more confident that you can grow quite a bit higher, possibly, than 30% this year and maybe even 30% in fiscal 2024? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Great, Tim. Thanks for the question. And, yes, just to answer, very happy that we're ahead of plan right now based on our strong outlook for Q1. Second, we do continue to get more supply. You saw that in our fourth quarter as well as in our first quarter outlook, which is very positive. I think -- as well, the order momentum continues to be strong. We had very, very strong bookings in our fourth quarter, which give us a lot of confidence in our 2023 outlook and beyond. And then, of course, new design wins, when you look out to 2024, also have us feeling very good. So, I think we're tracking really well across the board, and we're very pleased with the results we've got plus our outlook plus the long-term view.\nTimothy Arcuri: Matt, can I sneak in a quick second one? I was wondering if you--\nMatt Murphy: Sure.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks. Can you sort of size the custom ASIC business? I know it's reported across different segments, but can you maybe add up all of the custom ASIC revenue and just give us a sense for sort of how big it is in aggregate today? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Tim, this is an interesting question. We've actually gotten this on and off over the years. And just to kind of refresh the investors on the line, it's really hard to define this precisely because when you think about customization, you have a range of products and business models that we offer. For example, we have a full custom business in the traditional sense of the world. That would be an ASIC business that we picked up from Avera. But we also do a lot of semi-custom work or cloud optimized work as an example, where we work either with large hyperscalers or in the case of telecom with 5G to take the customer's IP and our IP and put it together. And then even in our merchant offerings, candidly, we end up doing SKUs and derivatives that have something special for what our customers want. So, I'd say that generally, it's not something we can even exactly quantify internally. What I would say is it's an absolute trend. It's the way the market is moving. You have to be able to have a rich set of intellectual property and flexibility in your business model and how you engage with your customers. And that's not just for the hyperscale cloud, Tim, it's also for 5G. It's for enterprise as well. And then in the future, I think this is going to be a key differentiator for us in automotive as well as what we call our flexible business model. But anyway, I think that's as much as I can say. It's a hot trend. It's the way the market is moving, and we're probably the best positioned company to take advantage of it.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay Matt. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Thanks Tim.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. You may now go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Matt, given that conditions are so supply constrained, how are you ensuring the quality of demand and the backlog and making sure customers are not just stocking up in product? And related to that is the strength in the enterprise market, which seems to be well above what conventional wisdom and history would suggest, but you seem to be incrementally even more positive. So, just thoughts on just demand quality overall and sustainability of the strength in enterprise?\nMatt Murphy: Sure, Vivek. Yes, this is something we've been paying extremely close attention to, not just even in the fourth quarter, but really at the onset of this supply and demand imbalance as we were going through the pandemic. We have a very rigorous internal review process. We have very good end market data in terms of everything from how many base stations ship to the number of -- to which carriers are deploying, that would be a 5G example. And then what is our content as it relates to that, we gave very good data on the cloud deployments. We know how many servers are shipping. We can then calculate all, kinds of, things about, which products that we have attaching to those. Same with enterprise, et cetera. So we have an end market focus that we look at. We also -- because we're actually a very focused company, Vivek, we have a handful of major accounts that we go very deep with. And given the system-level nature of what we do, we have very good insight into what they're doing and what the needs are. On top of that, we've also put in place a very rigorous, I guess, engagement model with our customers, where the backlog is firm. We do have non-cancelable conditions on those orders. Reschedules are limited. And so we've gone through a process to make sure that as we schedule the backlog and we get bookings, it's actually what people want. And then we prioritize around that. And then finally, I would say that this crisis has brought, I'd say, the leaders of the chip industry and the leaders of the OEMs even closer. And so my interactions all the way to the CEO level of our major customers is another way that we triangulate. As it relates to enterprise, most of the growth here, Vivek candidly is a combination of significant content gain as the electronics inside these various pieces of enterprise infrastructure have migrated to things like multi-gigabit Ethernet. They've added things like security and MACsec. We've also -- and there's just more ASP per port as an example there. We've also been focused on this area. So if you look at traditional Marvell business in enterprise switch and PHY, we've gained market share through our offerings by refreshing the portfolio and staying competitive from a technical standpoint and staying focused on that market. And then we also have new product areas ramping, like custom silicon in enterprise, which basically, if you look at where we were a year ago in that custom area, I mean, that business is up dramatically year-over-year, and it's ramping very sharply in our fiscal 2023. So there's a lot layering in. And the trends are real, too. I mean, if you just look at what we even go through at Marvell and other major companies, as you bring people back to work. Things have changed over the last two years. And so there's an enterprise upgrade cycle that's also kicking in as companies spend to modernize their infrastructure. So I think it's a combination of those things. The numbers are dramatic in terms of the growth. We're excited by that, and we see this business continuing to grow in fiscal 2023 and beyond off of this already higher base of revenue that we're achieving.\nVivek Arya: Thanks Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. You may now go ahead.\nJohn Pitzer: Yeah. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Matt, congratulations on the solid results. A lot of things to highlight, I was wondering if you could spend a few minutes just talking about gross margins, both cyclically and secularly. Clearly, you're seeing some input cost increases in your supply chain. I'm assuming given how strong gross margins are your ability to pass that on is pretty high. But the real crux of my question is, when you guys talked about restructuring the ARM server business as more of a custom silicon business, you talked about how margins on that customer -- gross margins on that custom silicon side could be a little bit lower, op margins kind of neutral to the overall model. But ever since you kind of reset that bar, you've done a better job on the gross margin line. So I guess my question really is as you're getting into these custom engagements, are you finding out that the profitability is perhaps better than you originally thought?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, John, for the questions. And certainly, the solid results, in a large part, were driven by the very durable gross margin performance of the company. We're pleased to have set a record gross margin of 65.3% this past quarter. We also guided gross margins to be in the 65% to 66% range, which is, call it, at the mid. Then we went all the way up to the high-end range of our long-term model. So despite input cost increases and all kinds of challenges the teams faced, I think the quality of our engineering and the quality of the products is ultimately what's enabling us to maintain our gross margin in a range that allows us to invest back in the business. On your question about what happens with some of these custom products and when they start ramping and -- well, first of all, they've already started ramping, right? We're deep into high volume in cloud optimized silicon. If you look at our data center revenue, it's obviously our biggest segment within data center. The majority of that is cloud. Cloud on its own would be larger than any of our other segments. So there's already that contribution. And if you remember from our Investor Day, Jean had a great chart of our gross margins by end market. And if you recall, data center and automotive actually were the two highest ones, and those are also happen to be two of our highest growth businesses. So look, I think an individual product here or there that's lower gross margin, if you will, but higher op margin, to be honest, this business is already so large and it's growing so fast. We're able to deal with anything that might be slightly less gross margin than the average because we also have products like from Inphi as an example, that are growing even -- that are higher gross margin and are growing even faster. So I think that's the beauty of our model, John. We can actually grow this business. We can be aggressive to take large, high-volume sockets, especially in compute. And we could do that and still maintain the company's long-term target model on margins, which I think is a testament to the business model we've put together and the rich mix of products we have.\nJohn Pitzer: Helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. You may now go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Matt, on the call, you talked about a number of new products that are ramping this year and beyond as well as new design wins. So curious, two-part question. First, are you including both of those -- or did you include both of those when you originally guided the $5.9 billion for fiscal 2023? And then as you think about these design wins coming into the model, is there a way to kind of rank order or highlight kind of the one, two, or three that you think are most relevant to the model into fiscal 2024 and beyond?\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes, CJ, I think as it relates to the design win side and new products, I think a couple of things to think about. First of all, as I've said in my remarks -- and I just want to give a shout-out. Our sales field applications team and our business units absolutely knocked it out of the park this year on design wins. It was a significant step-up in achievement. We just went through our process to review kind of the final numbers. They did a great job. Our funnel is as large as ever with respect to the opportunities in front of us. The incremental wins that we've got, some of them do -- as we mentioned, they will layer in, in fiscal 2024 and 2025. Some of them may start a little bit earlier. But typically, when you get a new design win on a new product, it's typically not in the existing fiscal year. But remember, we've also got the revenue that's going to feed the $400 million, going to $800 million. That's looking really good, and that's also planned to start ramping in the second half of this year. So I think just the way to think about it is, the incremental wins we keep getting, in the cloud area specifically, really sort of are additive to the fiscal 2024 and 2025. There's not a lot that you see -- just wouldn't from a timing perspective, capture a lot of it this year. But I would say, at the same time, the ones that we already won are tracking very well.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. You may now go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I just want to follow up on John's question on margins. And one thing we saw last month, your earnings, was that pricing kind of superseded future wafer costs. A lot of people saw a benefit in the first quarter and margins come down. So I'm just kind of curious, if you can talk about the kind of the strength in gross margin. And then just, I wanted to make sure that this is a level that you kind of build off of and it wasn't that same dynamic a lot of other companies saw through earnings.\nJean Hu: Hi, Blayne. Thanks for the question. I think, we have been in a very tight supply chain environment. So we have been dealing with the cost increase, price increase on the supply chain side for a long time now. For us, our team will work with the suppliers and customers closely and really try to just offset the cost increase during the whole thing. We have a very long product cycle. So we can plan ahead. Our gross margin is primarily driven by the end market mix that Matt talked about earlier. If you look at this Q4 and Q1, the guidance, we are very pleased with the gross margin, but largely because the data center is growing really fast. Automotive, they are growing really fast, Enterprise market, end market gross margin is also very strong, continue to trend up. So overall, if you look at our mix, that really drive our gross margin. For the rest of the year, it will be the similar situation in any given quarter. It largely depends on the mix.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks, Jean.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. You may now go ahead.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could touch on the supply-demand situation a little bit more. You said delinquencies are still kind of rising, but you are getting more supply. Any progress on getting lead times down? And can you tell, in a lot of these cases, are you still kind of the bottleneck is your product to constraint, or is there any possibility of your product kind of waiting for other chips to arrive?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Hey, Joe, great question. And you've been doing this a long time like me. It's shocking to say, I never thought we would be at this point in this cycle. But, yes, the gap between supply and demand has actually grown. And we look at our -- some companies call it unfulfilled backlog. We -- I was raised in the old school, which is calling it delinquency. But that number continues to rise each quarter. It rose in the fourth quarter and it will also rise in the first quarter. So, demand is very strong. Now I think we're -- so -- but yes, we're getting more supply. And you see we're actually exceeding our guidance from last quarter and our Q1 guide is very strong, both sequentially and year-over-year. But we're still having to grind hard with our suppliers to get more of what we need. We've moved -- although I'd say, dramatically, we've -- our position within the supply chain, I think, relative to the key suppliers we engage with understanding our opportunity, I mean that has been a big transformation over the last year. And hats off to our team in operations, led by Chris Koopmans and also our business units and even myself personally engaging up and down the supply chain. So, they understand our opportunity, which is, I think, helping us. And we just continue to prioritize, Joe. It's -- I'm very close. I'm personally involved with all the major accounts. We've managed to not be the long pole in the tent or if we were, it wasn't for very long. So, we've been able to sort of stay barely ahead but -- and we're satisfying customers. We don't have anybody line down that I know of right now, but it gets tight as we continue to ramp and customers have designed us in. But I think we're managing it very well, and we'll continue to just be very tactical in the short-term to get the supply we need to match it to the right demand, make sure we're not building inventory, and do our best to manage through this unprecedented cycle we're in. And I think the final thing I would say is it's a cycle that we haven't seen at least in terms of the strength and the duration. And I think on top of that, with Marvell, given our increased market share, the end market exposure we have with the secular growth drivers we have, that's making it even -- creating even more pressure on us given those dynamics. But we're up for the challenge. And I think our team is doing a great job, and we'll continue to work closely with our customers to make it happen.\nJoe Moore: Thank you very much.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. You may now go ahead.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Thank you and congratulations on the record results. Matt, I think a big highlight at least from me this quarter is what you said about custom enterprise business and if you look your carrier and your cloud, I think it's pretty obvious -- like a handful of companies. But enterprise is probably a much bigger group of companies. Could you just elaborate a little bit on that? I mean, on the custom enterprise side, are you actually going to be working with more than perhaps a half dozen companies?\nMatt Murphy: Well, like everything, Tore, ultimately, even though there's certainly a broader set of OEMs and diversity of applications in, let's call it, the enterprise market than maybe people that make base stations. The reality is the folks that can afford or want to do a full custom design is a narrower subset. That being said, I think our ability to do this kind of optimization, if you will, without maybe having to do a full custom design, that's one advantage we bring to the table. That's a little bit of a different business model. And then -- but yeah, it's multiple customers that we're engaged with. And they want a lot of the same things, including all of our high-performance IP. They want 5-nanometer going to 3-nanometer. Actually, our capability in compute is very attractive, especially as a lot of the trends in the hyperscale now, Tore, are starting to manifest themselves in the enterprise. And people are looking to do acceleration in an offload fashion. In our DPU -- OCTEON DPU capability, whether we sell it as a card or we customize a chip and then somebody else puts the solution together, there's a lot of really interesting things going on in the enterprise. And then finally, even on the core processing opportunity as well, our latest OCTEON 10 product is very competitive in the market. It's the most competitive one we've had in 5-nanometer. So anyway, much broader, obviously, set of opportunities than we had before, Tore. But going back to your comment, yeah, on custom enterprise, we're really pleased with the uplift in revenue. And we're also pleased with the pipeline we have there, because these products last a long time. And the overall profitability and gross margin profile of the enterprise business in Marvell is -- Jean showed this at the Investor Day, but it's about where the corporate average is. So very healthy gross margins, broad set of customers, broad set of applications and very long product life cycles that are very sticky once you get designed in. And we're able to pull-through other sockets. I mean there are -- in Ethernet-based designs as an example, you can pull through the five. So there's a lot of great things going on in enterprise.\nTore Svanberg: Thank you Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. You may now go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Hi, Matt. A question on the 400ZR cycle. You said, it's going to grow in Q1, but you also said something even more interesting that it's going to be high -- I guess, you said the revenue is going to be higher than the previous peak. I know we are in very, very early days in this cycle. So if you could just talk about what's driving that strength? And also, if you could put into some perspective, how big you think the SAM is going to be versus the previous, I guess, that 100ZR, I think that would be very helpful.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah, sure. And just to clarify, when we talk about the peak, I'm including the original 100-gig products, which is COLORZ, right, which was developed by Inphi, and now we have COLORZ 2, which is 400 gig. So COLORZ, when it was, sort of, at its peak, was about $100 million run rate for Inphi and then as -- into Marvell. And so what we're saying now is that COLORZ, COLORZ 2 total contribution, it's at a peak revenue. The DCI contribution, the DCI revenue of that -- the DCI product line, if you will, is going to be at peak revenues in Q1 and then grow from there. In the past, on 100 gig, it was really driven by one customer, and that was almost a semi-custom like engagement. In 400ZR, there are multiple hyperscale customers that we're working with. We'll have multiple customers. And it's the start of a very exciting ramp on our products. And this is a transition that we've all been waiting for, but it's here, and it's contributing to revenue now in Q1.\nSrini Pajjuri: Got it. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. You may now go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results and execution. On your cloud optimized ASIC and some of your DIY design win pipeline, $400 million target in fiscal 2024. I think, Matt, you said that you're on track for doubling that in fiscal 2025, fiscal 2026. so now that you guys are deep in the design phase for many of these products at 5-nanometers, can you guys just give us a sense of the types of chips you're developing for your cloud customers? Is it primarily AI and machine learning acceleration? Is it video transcode? Is it custom DPUs, surplus CPUs, et cetera? And then any color on this point would be great. And then just as important, is the team already starting to engage on early 3-nanometer programs with your cloud customers on their next-generation ASIC programs?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Well, it's a great question. And I think you understand quite well the sensitivities we have with respect to these types of engagement with the hyperscalers. I would say, it's between what we've won and the pipeline that we're pursuing, it's pretty much all of those applications that you're discussing. It's acceleration primarily. And it could be for things like video. It could be for things like security or storage. There are networking ASICs that we're doing that are very customized. There's compute. There's custom DPUs, if you will. Think of it as -- and then by the way, we said some of this. I mean the \u2013 as you look at sort of the SmartNIC opportunity -- and we've been saying this for a while. There is a lot of customization going on in that segment as well. So it's a wide range, Harlan. There's no sort of one trick pony in here -- and in aggregate, they're all tracking extremely well. And we gave a very judged view, by the way, when we gave those numbers. So obviously -- maybe not obviously, but our customers' forecasts are actually higher than what we gave you, but that's sort of our baseline. But we've now won incremental designs, which would layer on top of that. So I think it's all positive, but our ability to get super precise at this point without a customer announcement would be a little bit tough.\nHarlan Sur: And you guys -- are you guys already engaged on early 3-nanometer?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Sorry, yes. So we're very engaged on 3-nanometer, Harlan. I mean that's actually a key part of -- to be honest, why we've been winning in 5-nanometer is having that very committed, very rich 3-nanometer IP portfolio underway. And we're in deep architecture discussion now on multiple products and in multiple end markets, by the way, from cloud to 5G to enterprise about using our 3-nanometer platform. So we're on the nanometer train, and we're fully committed and we're executing quite well on our road map and customers are excited.\nHarlan Sur: Yes. Strong momentum. Thanks, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thank you, Harlan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. You may now go ahead.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks for the question. I also want to echo my congrats. You mentioned a new opportunity here, Matt. AEC -- or DSP for AEC. Basically, I guess my questions are, what's the timing on this product when it comes to market? How big do you think this market could be here? And ultimately, are you guys in a position to take majority share? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. We're pretty excited about this transition in the market, Chris, as you -- and I said some of this in my prepared remarks. But traditionally, this type of active cable hasn't been needed or at least the last generation that -- where it was needed was based on NRZ technology. So a little bit like we did -- and I'd say we, meaning, us and Inphi. We intercepted the market as it's about to take off in growth at 400 and 800 with PAM4-based technology in 6-nanometers. So this is -- think of this as just right in our wheelhouse in terms of leveraging what we've already got, but then optimizing the products for the specific application. Our partners -- and we've done some announcements. We've done a whole flurry of them. You've probably seen them around OFC coming up. But we're engaged with all the major cable manufacturers that supply to the hyperscalers. Are -- those cables are available. They're sampling to customers now. We're working directly with the cloud customers on additional enhancements to the road map. But we are going to be a force to be reckoned with in this market. And it's a perfect fit for us, because when you think about sort of having all the pieces, if you will, having the switch, having the optics, having now the AEC products, having the DPUs and that insight into the -- and then also ASICs that sort of hang around all these things in interface. We have a unique opportunity to really work with our customers to optimize the full solution. And that's something that maybe companies that only have one piece of the puzzle don't quite see what's exactly happening. So very excited about this. This is an incremental opportunity for us. Market size, depending on who you talk to, some are saying it's $1 billion-plus. I think -- but we'll see. We're optimistic that it's a big opportunity for us. We're still sizing what we think it means for Marvell, but we're in the market today.\nChristopher Rolland: Exciting. Thanks, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. You may now go ahead.\nGary Mobley: Hi, everyone. Thanks for sneaking in my question. I know you haven't filed your 10-K yet. But as it relates to that, is there anything notable with respect to purchase commitments on your behalf with your foundry partners, specifically, that's quantifiable and then as well, purchase commitments and CNRs they're called with respect to your customers?\nJean Hu: Hi, Gary, this is Jean. Yes, we have not filed 10-K yet. But as far as the purchase agreement, as you know, last quarter end, we have about $3 billion commitment we are engaging with our suppliers to ensure we have the capacity not only for this year, next year and for longer term. So as you probably noticed, a year ago, this is just $200 million. So we have increased our commitment significantly. You're going to see going forward, the same trend is because that's really the driving focus of the company to make sure we have the capacity to support our customers.\nMatt Murphy: And Gary, I would add, as Jean indicated, you can kind of follow the trend line. The engagements now, as we talked about -- you can actually directly relate them to some of the prior questions we had about our cloud optimized ramps in fiscal 2024 and 2025. We're planning our business out even beyond that with respect to some of the key capacity we need on the critical technologies that are required, substrates and various other pieces of the supply chain. So, you'll see that trend continue as we plan our business actually multiple both with our end OEMs and then our key supply chain partners to make sure we're all in lockstep to meet these very, very steep product ramps that are going to be required over the next few years.\nGary Mobley: Thank you, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Thank you, Gary.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. You may now go ahead.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very much guys for letting me on. Matt, I wanted to ask a quick question about the -- given that cloud is such an important part of your business. My own observation is that a lot of things are coming in the data center space in the next 12 months with Sapphire from Intel, with General from AMD, with PAM4 400-gig optics and a bunch of other things that are really to me to have a pretty big upgrade cycle in the data center spending space. And I wonder as you engage with your customers, how you're -- do you agree with that? Do you see an inflection in sort of pent-up spending given maybe Intel's road map has held back some things on lack of clarity? I just wonder how you would characterize over the next year or two the hyperscale spending environment as you guys see it today? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Matt, and welcome to the call. So, I think you're absolutely right on the trends that we're talking about here. I think as we have new processor refreshes, new server refreshes and then there's all kinds of chips, by the way, that are going to flow into the equation as well, not just the sort of the server itself, but then the acceleration that's going to be required, the new workloads, different AI, GPU clusters. I mean you just start going through all of the trends. And that is underpinning the ultimately, the silicon sort of architectures are underpinning fundamentally the cloud CapEx and what's needed. So, we -- as these new cycles come in and there's an inflection, it's really good for Marvell. And the PAM4 400-gig opportunities one, just great example. But our design win position on the new systems, right, in the new architectures that are coming, the content is just much higher, whether it's per data center, per server, you name it. And so I think that's exciting to us. And yes, there's been some delays from certain suppliers here and there. But as those as that roadmap gets executed and that transition happens, there's a lot of uplift for Marvell. And that is kind of another way to back into some of the growth that we're seeing and projecting that.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session.

            "name": "Matt Murphy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with the recap of the exceptional results Marvell delivered in fiscal 2022, an absolutely pivotal year for the company. We saw a substantial increase in design wins, the completion of two significant acquisitions, and strong revenue growth with great momentum in all our businesses. Our 5-nanometer technology platform, along with the rest of our data-centric IP portfolio, proved to be a key enabler for winning new opportunities in all of our focus markets. Our sales and product teams did a tremendous job securing new sockets and drove a record level of design wins in fiscal 2022, a big step up from the prior year. Fiscal 2022 was also a breakout year for our cloud optimized silicon platform, winning a sizable number of important sockets, which we expect will drive significant revenue for the company going forward. We remain focused on extending our leadership in process technology and advanced packaging. Our engineering teams are driving the architecture and design of our complex analog and mixed-signal IP to 3-nanometers. They are also advancing chiplet and 3D packaging technologies to support the integration of multiple advanced process nodes inside a single package. During the year, we completed the integration of Inphi, a transformational acquisition that substantially increased our participation in the fast-growing cloud data center market. The Marvell and Inphi team share very similar values founded on engineering excellence, innovation, and a passion for our customers' success. The teams have integrated exceptionally well across the company and are jointly taking our capabilities to new heights. Inphi's position at the core of cloud data centers has given the team unique insights into next-generation network architectures. The Inphi team has developed deep relationships with Tier 1 cloud customers, which has been instrumental in unlocking additional opportunities for the combined company, including the success of our cloud optimized silicon platform. The transaction, which was accretive to non-GAAP earnings within the first full quarter after close has been a resounding success, delivering revenue in fiscal 2022 above our deal model. We further complemented our cloud business with the Innovium acquisition, adding their leading cloud optimized switches to Marvell's feature-rich enterprise and carrier switch portfolio. The Innovium team is fully integrated and are leveraging Marvell's 5-nanometer technology platform and extensive SerDes IP to accelerate the road map for our next-generation 51.2 T switches. This development is closely aligned with our electrooptics DSP roadmap to provide customers with a complete solution optimized for power and performance. The combined Marvell and Innovium Ethernet switch portfolios are proving very attractive to data center customers, among them, a new design win at a Tier 1 cloud customer in Asia. We are also engaged with multiple additional customers and are looking forward to further expanding our footprint in this fast-growing market. Moving on to revenue. In fiscal 2022, revenue grew 50% year-on-year to $4.46 billion driven by robust demand for our products. The organic Marvell business and the acquired Inphi business were both strong contributors to growth. Our results reflect our success in the cloud, 5G, and automotive end markets, which collectively doubled in revenue from the prior year. Our enterprise networking end market also had a phenomenal year with revenue growing 43% year-over-year. Later in the call today, you will hear more details about the start of an extended period of infrastructure refreshes in the enterprise market. We expect that these, combined with share and content gains from our merchant products, will produce enduring growth in our enterprise business. And not only that, you will also hear me talk about a new driver of revenue growth in the enterprise networking market. Shifting gears to our fourth quarter, we delivered a record $1.34 billion in revenue, growing 11% sequentially and 68% year-over-year. Revenue exceeded the midpoint of guidance with all end markets growing sequentially and year-over-year. Of particular note, cloud and enterprise networking delivered stronger than projected contributions. Cloud, 5G, and auto collectively increased to 40% of total revenue in the fourth quarter. We exited fiscal 2022 with record bookings momentum and opportunities for accelerated growth across our business going forward. We continue to win in the market as our customer look to expand the scope of their engagements with Marvell. Our operations team continues to secure capacity, and we're tightly engaged with our strategic suppliers. Growth in demand continues to outstrip increases in supply. And as a result, our delinquency has continued to grow. We are working closely with our suppliers to secure additional capacity wherever possible. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the fourth quarter was $574 million, growing 15% sequentially and 113% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance. The majority of the growth was from cloud driven by robust demand from hyperscale customers. Let me note that our on-premise data center business also grew sequentially and year-over-year. In the fourth quarter, sequential and year-over-year revenue growth was broad-based with multiple product lines contributing to the excellent results. We expect the demand outlook from cloud customers to remain strong, and we are also looking forward to the ramp of new design wins. At our Investor Day, we discussed our expectations for $400 million in incremental revenue contributions in fiscal 2024 from new cloud optimized wins, doubling to $800 million in fiscal 2025. Development of these programs is well on track with several products slated to enter production later this year and start contributing meaningful revenue. Since that update, we have won multiple additional cloud optimized designs. Similar to the wins in prior quarters, these chips are for a variety of networking and compute offload or acceleration functions in cloud data centers. We are expecting revenue contributions from these new wins to start as early as fiscal 2024 and then ramp more substantially over time. Both of these wins are incremental to what we had discussed at our Investor Day. In aggregate, in fiscal 2022, we have won over a dozen cloud optimized programs across multiple Tier 1 cloud customers. A significant number of these designs are for custom DPU implementations, reflecting the increase in the attach rate of DPUs inside cloud data centers. We expect this trend to accelerate in next-generation architectures. We are confident that we are uniquely positioned to win these opportunities with our leading portfolio of compute, networking, security, storage and high-speed electro-optics IP, all of them delivered on our cloud optimized 5-nanometer platform. In our electro-optics business, we are continuing to innovate. We are aggressively driving the road map to improve power performance in leading-edge technology nodes with our next-generation products. We have begun volume shipments of our 800-gig PAM4 DSPs, enabling customers to start deployment of 800-gig optical modules in cloud data center and AI network applications. We are confident that we are the industry's first PAM4 DSP supplier to achieve this production milestone. Let me now discuss a new product line we just announced for the emerging active electrical cable market. This opens up another avenue of growth for us in the data center, leveraging our core DSP expertise. Today, our PAM4 products are primarily deployed in optical modules, used in cloud data centers for long-reach, switch-to-switch connections. In the same data centers, short-reach connections between switches, between server to top of rack switches and in AI interconnects have traditionally used passive electrical cables for speeds of up to 50 gig per lane. None of these requires advanced signal processing today. However, in next-generation cloud data centers, AI, ML and other data-intensive workloads are pushing these short-reach connections to higher 100 gig per lane throughput. At these speeds, passive electrical cables have significant reach and performance limitations. To overcome these challenges, the industry is turning to active electrical cables, referred to as ADCs, which require advanced DSPs. To meet that demand, Marvell has introduced the industry's first 400-gig and 800-gig DSPs for the ADC market, based on our leading PAM4 SerDes technology. Our unique business model allows us to work with both cloud customers, as well as all leading cable manufacturers to drive an open ecosystem. Our industry-leading DSPs have enabled major cable vendors to complete development of their first ADC solutions. We are also working with multiple cloud operators to take advantage of this new growth opportunity. On the storage side, our leading process technology platform and PCIe road map execution continues to drive new design wins for our data center SSD controllers. During the quarter, we secured designs with our PCIe Gen 5 controllers at two additional NAND OEMs, making a total of three who are adopting the Marvell solution. Looking ahead, our team is also pushing forward with our PCIe Gen 6 development, and our customers are very excited about our road map. Moving on to our expectations for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal 2023 from our data center end market, we project revenue to grow sequentially in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis and more than double year-over-year. We are expecting another strong performance led by cloud customers across a broad range of products. We are also projecting the start of a strong ramp of our 400-gig ZR data center interconnect products. In fact, we are expecting this ramp to drive our DCI revenue to a new record in the first quarter, eclipsing the peak we had achieved in the 100-gig cycle. Even at this very early stage of industry adoption, we are excited to see the rapid growth of 400 ZR, and we expect to see a lot more growth over time. Looking forward, we see ongoing growth in the data center, including revenue contribution starting from the new cloud-optimized product ramps to drive another step-up in our data center revenue in the second half of this fiscal year and beyond. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $241 million, growing 12% sequentially and 45% year-over-year. These results were driven by our 5G business, which delivered substantial revenue growth of over 30% sequentially, exceeding our guidance. We benefited from the broader rollout of 5G technology and product ramps at multiple base station customers. Marvell recently announced a collaboration with Dell on their new suite of telecom solutions to help service providers enable their transformation to open cloud-native networks. This offering includes a codeveloped open RAN accelerator card using our proven OCTEON Fusion baseband silicon to deliver in-line 5G layer 1 processing. We continue to see strong traction on our 5G technology platform, resulting in another key 5-nanometer design win for a radio ASIC at a Tier 1 base station customer. Following the strong step-up in the fourth quarter, we expect revenue from the carrier end market to continue to grow in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. We are projecting revenue to grow in the low single-digits sequentially, while year-over-year growth is expected to remain strong at over 40%. Moving on to our enterprise networking and end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $263 million, growing 6% sequentially and 64% year-over-year, another strong performance from this large and growing Marvell business. As you heard in the opening remarks, this end market is going through an inflection. Hybrid work is here to stay, but the current networking infrastructure was never designed to support this flexible, seamless, connect from anywhere, immersive, and high video usage environment. Companies are now embarking upon an extended period of refreshing their infrastructure, becoming borderless, enabling new digital capabilities, massively increasing bandwidth, building redundancy, and beefing up security. You will also remember from our prior discussions that we have been winning designs with our refreshed products over several years in this end market. These wins have typically come with higher Marvell content, driven by new features such as multi-gig Ethernet and MACsec. As the upgrade cycle in the enterprise networking market gains momentum, we are beginning to see our customers starting to ship their new platforms where we have higher share and increased content. Looking forward, we expect enterprises will continue to modernize their networks. And as a result, we project ongoing growth to continue from this end market.  Let me now discuss a new source of growth for Marvell in this end market, custom silicon. We have a very successful custom business in the carrier end market and are also building a large revenue stream from hyperscalers with our cloud optimized products. We are now enabling the enterprise networking market to take advantage of our advanced technology platform. I would like to point out that these designs frequently pull through additional Marvell content across a number of our product lines. Our pipeline of opportunities is growing and we see custom silicon becoming another leg to the enterprise networking tool, adding to the ongoing growth from our merchant products. We expect revenue from custom products and enterprise networking to grow sharply to well over $100 million in fiscal 2023. In aggregate, we expect a very durable period of high growth from enterprise networking to strongly complement our cloud, 5G, and auto pillars. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect growth to accelerate in our enterprise networking end market. We are projecting revenue to be up sequentially in the mid-teens on a percentage basis and year-over-year growth over 70%. Its growth outlook reflects our expectations of higher supply to support our product ramps and the ongoing enterprise infrastructure refresh cycle. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market, revenue for the fourth quarter was $79 million, growing 19% sequentially and 134% year-over-year. Strong revenue growth in this end market is being driven by higher adoption of our Brightlane Ethernet solutions in a growing number of vehicles from multiple OEMs. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting strong sequential growth to continue from auto and a flattish outlook for our industrial business. As a result, for the auto and industrial end market, we are projecting sequential revenue growth in the high single digits on a percentage basis, while year-over-year growth is expected above 80%. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $185 million, growing 2% sequentially and 11% year-over-year. Growth in this end market is being driven by our SSD controllers, shipping into consumer-oriented platforms such as game consoles. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect revenue to be flattish on a sequential basis and continue to grow year-over-year, approximately in the double digits on a percentage basis. In closing, we delivered record results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022, growing revenue well-above our long-term target model. We expect this momentum to continue. Marvell is uniquely positioned to benefit from the three most important growth opportunities in semiconductors; cloud, 5G and automotive. The transformation in the enterprise end market is also becoming another continuing growth driver for Marvell. We expect secular growth to continue from all our end markets, further supported by our large and growing pipeline of secured design wins, which will drive incremental revenue. We are also working to make sure that we grow in a responsible and sustainable manner. Over the past year, Marvell has taken meaningful action on evolving our environmental, social and governance strategy, setting new goals and increasing transparency. We've committed to achieving net-zero emissions as a company and are setting a science based target to put us on track to reach this goal. Building a more inclusive and diverse workforce is another important area of focus, and we have increased our outreach to traditionally underrepresented talent. I would encourage investors to visit our new ESG website to review the goals we've outlined and our progress to date. On behalf of Marvell's Board and leadership team, I thank our valued employees for the outstanding results they've helped deliver in the fourth quarter and throughout fiscal year 2022. Ours is a highly resilient team that has stayed focused and outperformed through an extended period of challenges and uncertainty. This is an exciting time for our company as we've hit an inflection point in our growth cycle and are seeing strong momentum in our businesses across the Board. I look forward to continuing to work alongside our exceptional Marvell team to address the numerous opportunities in front of us. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Yes. Great, Tim. Thanks for the question. And, yes, just to answer, very happy that we're ahead of plan right now based on our strong outlook for Q1. Second, we do continue to get more supply. You saw that in our fourth quarter as well as in our first quarter outlook, which is very positive. I think -- as well, the order momentum continues to be strong. We had very, very strong bookings in our fourth quarter, which give us a lot of confidence in our 2023 outlook and beyond. And then, of course, new design wins, when you look out to 2024, also have us feeling very good. So, I think we're tracking really well across the board, and we're very pleased with the results we've got plus our outlook plus the long-term view. Sure. Yes. Tim, this is an interesting question. We've actually gotten this on and off over the years. And just to kind of refresh the investors on the line, it's really hard to define this precisely because when you think about customization, you have a range of products and business models that we offer. For example, we have a full custom business in the traditional sense of the world. That would be an ASIC business that we picked up from Avera. But we also do a lot of semi-custom work or cloud optimized work as an example, where we work either with large hyperscalers or in the case of telecom with 5G to take the customer's IP and our IP and put it together. And then even in our merchant offerings, candidly, we end up doing SKUs and derivatives that have something special for what our customers want. So, I'd say that generally, it's not something we can even exactly quantify internally. What I would say is it's an absolute trend. It's the way the market is moving. You have to be able to have a rich set of intellectual property and flexibility in your business model and how you engage with your customers. And that's not just for the hyperscale cloud, Tim, it's also for 5G. It's for enterprise as well. And then in the future, I think this is going to be a key differentiator for us in automotive as well as what we call our flexible business model. But anyway, I think that's as much as I can say. It's a hot trend. It's the way the market is moving, and we're probably the best positioned company to take advantage of it. Thanks Tim. Sure, Vivek. Yes, this is something we've been paying extremely close attention to, not just even in the fourth quarter, but really at the onset of this supply and demand imbalance as we were going through the pandemic. We have a very rigorous internal review process. We have very good end market data in terms of everything from how many base stations ship to the number of -- to which carriers are deploying, that would be a 5G example. And then what is our content as it relates to that, we gave very good data on the cloud deployments. We know how many servers are shipping. We can then calculate all, kinds of, things about, which products that we have attaching to those. Same with enterprise, et cetera. So we have an end market focus that we look at. We also -- because we're actually a very focused company, Vivek, we have a handful of major accounts that we go very deep with. And given the system-level nature of what we do, we have very good insight into what they're doing and what the needs are. On top of that, we've also put in place a very rigorous, I guess, engagement model with our customers, where the backlog is firm. We do have non-cancelable conditions on those orders. Reschedules are limited. And so we've gone through a process to make sure that as we schedule the backlog and we get bookings, it's actually what people want. And then we prioritize around that. And then finally, I would say that this crisis has brought, I'd say, the leaders of the chip industry and the leaders of the OEMs even closer. And so my interactions all the way to the CEO level of our major customers is another way that we triangulate. As it relates to enterprise, most of the growth here, Vivek candidly is a combination of significant content gain as the electronics inside these various pieces of enterprise infrastructure have migrated to things like multi-gigabit Ethernet. They've added things like security and MACsec. We've also -- and there's just more ASP per port as an example there. We've also been focused on this area. So if you look at traditional Marvell business in enterprise switch and PHY, we've gained market share through our offerings by refreshing the portfolio and staying competitive from a technical standpoint and staying focused on that market. And then we also have new product areas ramping, like custom silicon in enterprise, which basically, if you look at where we were a year ago in that custom area, I mean, that business is up dramatically year-over-year, and it's ramping very sharply in our fiscal 2023. So there's a lot layering in. And the trends are real, too. I mean, if you just look at what we even go through at Marvell and other major companies, as you bring people back to work. Things have changed over the last two years. And so there's an enterprise upgrade cycle that's also kicking in as companies spend to modernize their infrastructure. So I think it's a combination of those things. The numbers are dramatic in terms of the growth. We're excited by that, and we see this business continuing to grow in fiscal 2023 and beyond off of this already higher base of revenue that we're achieving. Yeah. Yes. Thanks, John, for the questions. And certainly, the solid results, in a large part, were driven by the very durable gross margin performance of the company. We're pleased to have set a record gross margin of 65.3% this past quarter. We also guided gross margins to be in the 65% to 66% range, which is, call it, at the mid. Then we went all the way up to the high-end range of our long-term model. So despite input cost increases and all kinds of challenges the teams faced, I think the quality of our engineering and the quality of the products is ultimately what's enabling us to maintain our gross margin in a range that allows us to invest back in the business. On your question about what happens with some of these custom products and when they start ramping and -- well, first of all, they've already started ramping, right? We're deep into high volume in cloud optimized silicon. If you look at our data center revenue, it's obviously our biggest segment within data center. The majority of that is cloud. Cloud on its own would be larger than any of our other segments. So there's already that contribution. And if you remember from our Investor Day, Jean had a great chart of our gross margins by end market. And if you recall, data center and automotive actually were the two highest ones, and those are also happen to be two of our highest growth businesses. So look, I think an individual product here or there that's lower gross margin, if you will, but higher op margin, to be honest, this business is already so large and it's growing so fast. We're able to deal with anything that might be slightly less gross margin than the average because we also have products like from Inphi as an example, that are growing even -- that are higher gross margin and are growing even faster. So I think that's the beauty of our model, John. We can actually grow this business. We can be aggressive to take large, high-volume sockets, especially in compute. And we could do that and still maintain the company's long-term target model on margins, which I think is a testament to the business model we've put together and the rich mix of products we have. Yes. Sure. Yes, CJ, I think as it relates to the design win side and new products, I think a couple of things to think about. First of all, as I've said in my remarks -- and I just want to give a shout-out. Our sales field applications team and our business units absolutely knocked it out of the park this year on design wins. It was a significant step-up in achievement. We just went through our process to review kind of the final numbers. They did a great job. Our funnel is as large as ever with respect to the opportunities in front of us. The incremental wins that we've got, some of them do -- as we mentioned, they will layer in, in fiscal 2024 and 2025. Some of them may start a little bit earlier. But typically, when you get a new design win on a new product, it's typically not in the existing fiscal year. But remember, we've also got the revenue that's going to feed the $400 million, going to $800 million. That's looking really good, and that's also planned to start ramping in the second half of this year. So I think just the way to think about it is, the incremental wins we keep getting, in the cloud area specifically, really sort of are additive to the fiscal 2024 and 2025. There's not a lot that you see -- just wouldn't from a timing perspective, capture a lot of it this year. But I would say, at the same time, the ones that we already won are tracking very well. Yeah. Yes. Hey, Joe, great question. And you've been doing this a long time like me. It's shocking to say, I never thought we would be at this point in this cycle. But, yes, the gap between supply and demand has actually grown. And we look at our -- some companies call it unfulfilled backlog. We -- I was raised in the old school, which is calling it delinquency. But that number continues to rise each quarter. It rose in the fourth quarter and it will also rise in the first quarter. So, demand is very strong. Now I think we're -- so -- but yes, we're getting more supply. And you see we're actually exceeding our guidance from last quarter and our Q1 guide is very strong, both sequentially and year-over-year. But we're still having to grind hard with our suppliers to get more of what we need. We've moved -- although I'd say, dramatically, we've -- our position within the supply chain, I think, relative to the key suppliers we engage with understanding our opportunity, I mean that has been a big transformation over the last year. And hats off to our team in operations, led by Chris Koopmans and also our business units and even myself personally engaging up and down the supply chain. So, they understand our opportunity, which is, I think, helping us. And we just continue to prioritize, Joe. It's -- I'm very close. I'm personally involved with all the major accounts. We've managed to not be the long pole in the tent or if we were, it wasn't for very long. So, we've been able to sort of stay barely ahead but -- and we're satisfying customers. We don't have anybody line down that I know of right now, but it gets tight as we continue to ramp and customers have designed us in. But I think we're managing it very well, and we'll continue to just be very tactical in the short-term to get the supply we need to match it to the right demand, make sure we're not building inventory, and do our best to manage through this unprecedented cycle we're in. And I think the final thing I would say is it's a cycle that we haven't seen at least in terms of the strength and the duration. And I think on top of that, with Marvell, given our increased market share, the end market exposure we have with the secular growth drivers we have, that's making it even -- creating even more pressure on us given those dynamics. But we're up for the challenge. And I think our team is doing a great job, and we'll continue to work closely with our customers to make it happen. Yes. Well, like everything, Tore, ultimately, even though there's certainly a broader set of OEMs and diversity of applications in, let's call it, the enterprise market than maybe people that make base stations. The reality is the folks that can afford or want to do a full custom design is a narrower subset. That being said, I think our ability to do this kind of optimization, if you will, without maybe having to do a full custom design, that's one advantage we bring to the table. That's a little bit of a different business model. And then -- but yeah, it's multiple customers that we're engaged with. And they want a lot of the same things, including all of our high-performance IP. They want 5-nanometer going to 3-nanometer. Actually, our capability in compute is very attractive, especially as a lot of the trends in the hyperscale now, Tore, are starting to manifest themselves in the enterprise. And people are looking to do acceleration in an offload fashion. In our DPU -- OCTEON DPU capability, whether we sell it as a card or we customize a chip and then somebody else puts the solution together, there's a lot of really interesting things going on in the enterprise. And then finally, even on the core processing opportunity as well, our latest OCTEON 10 product is very competitive in the market. It's the most competitive one we've had in 5-nanometer. So anyway, much broader, obviously, set of opportunities than we had before, Tore. But going back to your comment, yeah, on custom enterprise, we're really pleased with the uplift in revenue. And we're also pleased with the pipeline we have there, because these products last a long time. And the overall profitability and gross margin profile of the enterprise business in Marvell is -- Jean showed this at the Investor Day, but it's about where the corporate average is. So very healthy gross margins, broad set of customers, broad set of applications and very long product life cycles that are very sticky once you get designed in. And we're able to pull-through other sockets. I mean there are -- in Ethernet-based designs as an example, you can pull through the five. So there's a lot of great things going on in enterprise. Yeah. Yeah, sure. And just to clarify, when we talk about the peak, I'm including the original 100-gig products, which is COLORZ, right, which was developed by Inphi, and now we have COLORZ 2, which is 400 gig. So COLORZ, when it was, sort of, at its peak, was about $100 million run rate for Inphi and then as -- into Marvell. And so what we're saying now is that COLORZ, COLORZ 2 total contribution, it's at a peak revenue. The DCI contribution, the DCI revenue of that -- the DCI product line, if you will, is going to be at peak revenues in Q1 and then grow from there. In the past, on 100 gig, it was really driven by one customer, and that was almost a semi-custom like engagement. In 400ZR, there are multiple hyperscale customers that we're working with. We'll have multiple customers. And it's the start of a very exciting ramp on our products. And this is a transition that we've all been waiting for, but it's here, and it's contributing to revenue now in Q1. Yes. Yes. Well, it's a great question. And I think you understand quite well the sensitivities we have with respect to these types of engagement with the hyperscalers. I would say, it's between what we've won and the pipeline that we're pursuing, it's pretty much all of those applications that you're discussing. It's acceleration primarily. And it could be for things like video. It could be for things like security or storage. There are networking ASICs that we're doing that are very customized. There's compute. There's custom DPUs, if you will. Think of it as -- and then by the way, we said some of this. I mean the \u2013 as you look at sort of the SmartNIC opportunity -- and we've been saying this for a while. There is a lot of customization going on in that segment as well. So it's a wide range, Harlan. There's no sort of one trick pony in here -- and in aggregate, they're all tracking extremely well. And we gave a very judged view, by the way, when we gave those numbers. So obviously -- maybe not obviously, but our customers' forecasts are actually higher than what we gave you, but that's sort of our baseline. But we've now won incremental designs, which would layer on top of that. So I think it's all positive, but our ability to get super precise at this point without a customer announcement would be a little bit tough. Yes. Sorry, yes. So we're very engaged on 3-nanometer, Harlan. I mean that's actually a key part of -- to be honest, why we've been winning in 5-nanometer is having that very committed, very rich 3-nanometer IP portfolio underway. And we're in deep architecture discussion now on multiple products and in multiple end markets, by the way, from cloud to 5G to enterprise about using our 3-nanometer platform. So we're on the nanometer train, and we're fully committed and we're executing quite well on our road map and customers are excited. Yes. Thank you, Harlan. Yes. We're pretty excited about this transition in the market, Chris, as you -- and I said some of this in my prepared remarks. But traditionally, this type of active cable hasn't been needed or at least the last generation that -- where it was needed was based on NRZ technology. So a little bit like we did -- and I'd say we, meaning, us and Inphi. We intercepted the market as it's about to take off in growth at 400 and 800 with PAM4-based technology in 6-nanometers. So this is -- think of this as just right in our wheelhouse in terms of leveraging what we've already got, but then optimizing the products for the specific application. Our partners -- and we've done some announcements. We've done a whole flurry of them. You've probably seen them around OFC coming up. But we're engaged with all the major cable manufacturers that supply to the hyperscalers. Are -- those cables are available. They're sampling to customers now. We're working directly with the cloud customers on additional enhancements to the road map. But we are going to be a force to be reckoned with in this market. And it's a perfect fit for us, because when you think about sort of having all the pieces, if you will, having the switch, having the optics, having now the AEC products, having the DPUs and that insight into the -- and then also ASICs that sort of hang around all these things in interface. We have a unique opportunity to really work with our customers to optimize the full solution. And that's something that maybe companies that only have one piece of the puzzle don't quite see what's exactly happening. So very excited about this. This is an incremental opportunity for us. Market size, depending on who you talk to, some are saying it's $1 billion-plus. I think -- but we'll see. We're optimistic that it's a big opportunity for us. We're still sizing what we think it means for Marvell, but we're in the market today. Yes. And Gary, I would add, as Jean indicated, you can kind of follow the trend line. The engagements now, as we talked about -- you can actually directly relate them to some of the prior questions we had about our cloud optimized ramps in fiscal 2024 and 2025. We're planning our business out even beyond that with respect to some of the key capacity we need on the critical technologies that are required, substrates and various other pieces of the supply chain. So, you'll see that trend continue as we plan our business actually multiple both with our end OEMs and then our key supply chain partners to make sure we're all in lockstep to meet these very, very steep product ramps that are going to be required over the next few years. Thank you, Gary. Yes. Thanks, Matt, and welcome to the call. So, I think you're absolutely right on the trends that we're talking about here. I think as we have new processor refreshes, new server refreshes and then there's all kinds of chips, by the way, that are going to flow into the equation as well, not just the sort of the server itself, but then the acceleration that's going to be required, the new workloads, different AI, GPU clusters. I mean you just start going through all of the trends. And that is underpinning the ultimately, the silicon sort of architectures are underpinning fundamentally the cloud CapEx and what's needed. So, we -- as these new cycles come in and there's an inflection, it's really good for Marvell. And the PAM4 400-gig opportunities one, just great example. But our design win position on the new systems, right, in the new architectures that are coming, the content is just much higher, whether it's per data center, per server, you name it. And so I think that's exciting to us. And yes, there's been some delays from certain suppliers here and there. But as those as that roadmap gets executed and that transition happens, there's a lot of uplift for Marvell. And that is kind of another way to back into some of the growth that we're seeing and projecting that."

            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our fiscal year 2022 results. We are very pleased with our performance in fiscal 2022, delivering record revenue and profitability while continuing to aggressively invest to drive strong long-term growth from the data infrastructure market. Revenue grew significantly by 50% year-on-year to $4.46 billion. GAAP gross margin was 46.3% and the GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.53. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 64.9%, expanding by 160 basis points, reflecting the increase in value and the differentiation we provide to our customers. Revenue growth and gross margin expansion, combined with strong operating leverage from our business model, drove robust growth in earnings for the year. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded by 860 basis points from 24.2% to 32.8%. And non-GAAP earnings per share grew 71% year-on-year to $1.57. Moving on to our financial results for the fourth quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.343 billion, exceeding the middle point of our guidance, growing 11% sequentially and 68% year-over-year. Data center was our largest end market, driving 43% of consolidated revenue. Enterprise networking was next largest with 19% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 18%, consumer at 14% and auto industrial at 6%. GAAP gross margin was 51.1%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $877 million or 65.3% of revenue, another record driven by rich product mix, reflecting our strong IP position and the leading product portfolio. GAAP operating expenses were $652 million and include the cost of share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal settlements and acquisition and divestiture-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $390 million, at the low end of our guidance range. GAAP operating income was $35 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $487 million, up 115% from a year ago, growing significantly faster than revenue. We achieved a record of 36.3% non-GAAP operating margin, an improvement of 790 basis points from the prior year, reflects the strong operating leverage in our business model. For the fourth quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $0.01. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.50, up 72% year-over-year, exceeding the middle point of our guidance. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $346 million. I'm pleased with our strong cash flow generation while investing significantly in working capital to support strong revenue growth. We returned 51 million to shareholders through cash dividends. As of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $614 million, and our long-term debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.6 times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times. We are confident that we are on track to achieve our targeted gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio of two times by the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2023, at which time we expect to restart share repurchase. Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $720 million. $39 million of this inventory balance is from Innovium, due to purchase price accounting. We anticipate amortizing this step-up over the next two quarters. We have also increased our working process inventory to support the rapid growth in revenue we are forecasting. In summary, the Marvell team executed exceptionally well, delivering accelerated top line growth and strong earnings expansion significantly faster than revenue growth. Turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.425 billion, plus or minus 3%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 49.6% to 50.6%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 65% to 66%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $672 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $430 million to $435 million. For the first quarter, we expect non-GAAP tax rate of 6%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 848 million. And our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 863 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.03 per share on the low end to an income of $0.05 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.48 to $0.54. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. Hi, Blayne. Thanks for the question. I think, we have been in a very tight supply chain environment. So we have been dealing with the cost increase, price increase on the supply chain side for a long time now. For us, our team will work with the suppliers and customers closely and really try to just offset the cost increase during the whole thing. We have a very long product cycle. So we can plan ahead. Our gross margin is primarily driven by the end market mix that Matt talked about earlier. If you look at this Q4 and Q1, the guidance, we are very pleased with the gross margin, but largely because the data center is growing really fast. Automotive, they are growing really fast, Enterprise market, end market gross margin is also very strong, continue to trend up. So overall, if you look at our mix, that really drive our gross margin. For the rest of the year, it will be the similar situation in any given quarter. It largely depends on the mix. Hi, Gary, this is Jean. Yes, we have not filed 10-K yet. But as far as the purchase agreement, as you know, last quarter end, we have about $3 billion commitment we are engaging with our suppliers to ensure we have the capacity not only for this year, next year and for longer term. So as you probably noticed, a year ago, this is just $200 million. So we have increased our commitment significantly. You're going to see going forward, the same trend is because that's really the driving focus of the company to make sure we have the capacity to support our customers."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell\u2019s third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO. I would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management\u2019s current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. We closed the acquisition of Innovium on October 5, 2021. Therefore, the results we reported today for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 include the results from the Innovium business for 25 days of the fiscal quarter. Revenue from the acquired Innovium business is reported entirely within our data center end market. Please note that the guidance we have provided for the third quarter of fiscal 2022 on August 26, 2021, has not included in any expectations or results from the acquired Innovium. The financial outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022 we provided today includes expected results from the acquired Innovium business for the fourth quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter GAAP results. Revenue was $1.21 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance and represents another record achievement for Marvell. GAAP Gross margin was 48.5%, GAAP operating loss was $33 million, and loss per diluted share was $0.08. Revenue grew 13% sequentially and 61% year-over-year, an acceleration from the first half of this fiscal year. We saw great momentum in all five of our end markets, with revenue growing both sequentially and year-on-year. Our data center, carrier, enterprise networking, and auto industrial end markets all achieved record revenue and performed above guidance. Excellent operational and financial execution resulted in revenue 6% above the midpoint of our guidance. Our operations team continues to do a great job in sourcing incremental supply, and we are starting to see the fruits of their labor. Supply was better than expected in the third quarter, and we expect continued improvements as we move into the fourth quarter and next year. The additional capacity has better positioned us to catch up to the growth in demand, which so far has outpaced increases in supply. Moving on to our non-GAAP results for the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 65.1%, and we delivered $418 million in non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 34.5%. Higher revenue, coupled with stronger gross margin drove non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.43, 13% above the midpoint of guidance growing 72% year-over-year, which represents phenomenal growth in earnings. These are tremendous accomplishments, and I am very proud of the outstanding execution by our entire Marvell team in driving such strong results. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the third quarter was $500 million, growing 15% sequentially and 109% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance. Both the standalone Marvell business and the acquired Inphi business delivered strong growth, driven by robust demand from cloud customers. I would note that our on-premise data center business also grew sequentially and year-over-year. Data center is our most diverse end market with multiple product lines contributing to sequential revenue growth. These include 200-gig and 400-gig PAM4 electro-optics, data center interconnect ZR modules, SSD and HDD controllers, cloud-optimized SoCs, and Ethernet switches. In addition to strong end-market demand, the majority of these product lines are also benefiting from the start of new product ramps, which we expect will continue to drive sustained growth. As an example, in our SSD business, we benefited from a strong ramp of DIY controllers directly to a Tier 1 cloud customer. Remember, you heard at Investor Day, Marvell has been winning a large number of incremental cloud optimized silicon designs, and these are now in development. In addition, the design win funnel and level of activity on cloud optimized silicon engagements continues to accelerate, and we have recently won another socket with our storage accelerator. At our Investor Day, we discussed this new $500 million market for our storage business and cloud storage accelerators and disclosed our first design win with the cloud customer. Now, a key storage partner, KIOXIA, recently announced production availability of their NVMe over Fabric SSDs, which will also use our storage accelerators. These SSDs are for Ethernet Bunch of Flash systems designed for applications such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and high-performance computing. The KIOXIA SSDs connect to the network fabric natively using Ethernet by integrating a Marvell storage accelerator, which converts NVMe into 25 gigabit Ethernet. We are excited to see this new opportunity take shape with multiple customers starting to adopt our storage accelerators. Turning now to Innovium. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition, adding their cloud optimized switches to our broad data center portfolio. We're pleased that company\u2019s Co-founder and CTO, Puneet Agarwal, and the R&D team have become a part of Marvell. We are confident that our combined switch business -- businesses are now well positioned to be a strong provider of Ethernet switches to data centers, and we see an incredible opportunity ahead for Marvell in this high-growth market. We expect the acquisition of Innovium will result in $150 million in incremental revenue next fiscal year as we ramp switches into a large Tier 1 cloud customer they had won prior to the acquisition. We are also looking forward to supporting additional cloud customers such as LinkedIn, who are deploying Innovium\u2019s Teralynx-based switches in production across multiple data centers with the SONiC network OS. SONiC is an open network operating system, which provides cloud customers with more choice and interoperability as well as the ability to scale. We recently announced our commitment to supporting SONiC across both our Prestera and Teralynx products. Moving on to our expectations for revenue from our data center end market in our fourth fiscal quarter. Similar to the third quarter, we are expecting another strong performance led by cloud customers across a broad range of products. We expect data center revenue to more than double from a year ago, and we project sequential growth in the double digits on a percentage basis in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with the strength we are seeing from the cloud end market, which we expect will remain a strong driver of sustained growth for Marvell. Looking out further in time, we are also excited by the immense potential for another phase of growth as large-scale virtual environments such as Facebook is doing with their metaverse start to gain traction. For simplicity, while I will use the metaverse as a general descriptor for this discussion, we expect many different implementations of virtual environments enabled by a broad set of companies and ecosystems. Regardless of the form these environments take, the data sets will be exponentially larger compared to the current Internet, which is largely two-dimensional and latency will need to be extremely low to realistically simulate a real-world environment. As a result, we expect the metaverse will significantly accelerate a number of key trends, which are already occurring in the cloud today, including the need to store huge amounts of data in a secure environment, connected by high-speed, electro-optic links to custom compute engines. This next level of massive scaling makes the metaverse an even stronger candidate for cloud optimized silicon solutions that Marvell is currently enabling. This meshes perfectly with the core competencies we have already developed across compute, storage, security, networking, high-speed electro-optics and customization, which are driving our current success. And these are equally applicable to the variety of virtual environments, which we will develop over time. The metaverse also has the potential to be a killer app for 5G, another area of strength for Marvell. Multiple cloud customers have already engaged with us, as they start designing the architecture of their next generation of data infrastructure to enable a significantly richer set of virtual applications and experiences. Turning now to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $215 million, growing 9% sequentially and 28% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance. Growth was driven by our 5G products ramping at multiple customers. We are also able to improve supply for our wired business to enable sequential growth. Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect a strong ramp in our 5G business of approximately 30% sequentially. And as a result, we project our combined carrier infrastructure revenue across our wireless and wired end sequentially in the low-teens on a percentage basis, while year-on-year growth is expected to accelerate to over 40%. It's exciting to see the step-up in our 5G business, and we expect significant additional growth over the next several years as 5G adoption continues to grow around the globe, combined with Marvell content gains from designs we have won, but not yet begun to ramp. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $247 million, growing 11% sequentially and 56% year-over-year, with the majority of the growth coming from standalone Marvell products. This performance was significantly better than our expectations as our operations team did an excellent job securing additional supply to better address the increase in demand for our products. From a product perspective, in the third quarter, the continuation of strong year-on-year growth was driven primarily by Marvell's Ethernet networking portfolio. We have been gaining share and benefiting from the very deliberate investments we have made in our enterprise Ethernet switch platform as well as the combined Marvell and the Quantify portfolio. In addition, our content has been growing driven by increase in multi-gig Ethernet adoption. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter for our enterprise networking end market, we project revenue sequentially to be up in the low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis and year-over-year growth is expected to remain very strong at approximately 60%. We expect this strong growth to be driven by continued share gains from Marvell products combined with ongoing recovery in the enterprise networking end market. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market, which is served primarily by stand-alone Marvell businesses. Revenue for the third quarter was $67 million, growing 16% sequentially and 114% year-over-year, driven by ongoing ramps in our auto business. I'm pleased to report that our team has now driven our auto business to over $140 million annualized revenue run rate in the third quarter, ahead of our prior expectations. We are benefiting from a faster pace of adoption of our Ethernet solutions by auto OEMs, who are prioritizing the production of their latest models, which tend to have higher semiconductor content. We are confident that we are well on our way to driving a multi-hundred million dollar revenue stream from our -- auto Ethernet business over the next few years. Looking beyond connectivity, our next multibillion-dollar market opportunity for Marvell is in automotive compute. A future of technology in cars is all about electrification and intelligence with embedded security and onboard storage in a fully networked environment. Similar to the rise of optimized silicon and cloud, automotive OEMs are realizing that to differentiate their products and deliver the most value to their customers, they need unique technology and IP to be embedded in compute silicon optimized to their specific platforms. You don't need to look too far to see evidence for the sea change. Recent industry commentary, including from Ford and Volkswagen, talks about their focus on developing internal silicon design expertise, desire to customize off-the-shelf compute and their intentions to design and develop their own shifts for autonomous vehicles. Similar to our successful strategy of partnering with hyperscale customers for cloud-optimized silicon, we are confident that our co-development business model and rich IP portfolio is equally attractive to automotive OEMs. In this model, the design is done in true partnership with the customer focusing on the portions proprietary to their platform and Marvell bringing our own unique compute, security, Ethernet networking and storage silicon IP to the table. The end solution is a semi-custom design, which represents the best of both worlds, allowing our customers to achieve their ambitions and retain control of their roadmap. In doing so, they can not only preserve their differentiation with a faster time to market, but it will also enable a lower level of investment, thanks to Marvell. We see compute becoming an increasingly important part of our growing automotive business, adding to our very successful Ethernet connectivity solutions. Reflecting this broadening of our portfolio, I'm very pleased to introduce Marvell's new brand for Automotive Solutions, Brightlane, which includes our gigabit and multi-gigabit Ethernet switches and PHYs for connectivity and our OCTEON processors for compute. At our Investor Day, we had discussed our first major auto compute win based on our OCTEON Brightlane platform. The semi-custom design is now in development. We are seeing a significant increase in compute related activity with additional auto OEMs, both traditional and new market entrants. And I look forward to updating you on our progress in this exciting new long-term growth pillar for Marvell. Turning to the outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter for our auto and industrial end market. We expect strong revenue growth to continue. We project sequential growth in the double digits on a percentage basis and year-over-year growth to remain above 100%. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $183 million, growing 10% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially in the low single digits on a percentage basis and year-on-year growth in the double digits on a percentage basis. We are benefiting from strong growth driven by our SSD controllers that we have targeted a differentiated sticky, long-lived and high ROI applications such as game consoles. In closing, we delivered very strong results for our third quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue in our fourth quarter and next year. Both the acquired Inphi business and the standalone Marvell business are firing on all cylinders. In the third quarter, the stand-alone Marvell business delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth close to 30%. The Inphi business performed even better. The midpoint of our guidance for revenue in the fourth quarter implies a similar approximately 30% year-over-year growth rate for each of these businesses. We are proud of these results and our outlook for growth in the fourth quarter, which is well above the high end of our long-term revenue growth target of a 15% to 20% CAGR. Securing capacity for growth remains the highest priority for our operations team even as the supply expansion comes with an increase in input costs. As we have done throughout the supply crunch, we are working with our customers to adjust prices to offset the impact of these cost increases, which led us jointly benefit from sustained growth. As we look at next fiscal year, we will continue to drive supply improvements, and we expect demand to remain above the high-end of our long-term target mode. As a result, we anticipate a sustained period of strong revenue growth for Marvell. From a base of approximately $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022, we expect the combined Marvell and Inphi business to continue growing in fiscal 2023 at the 30% year-on-year rate we are currently achieving. On top of this, we expect an additional $150 million of revenue in fiscal 2023, resulting from the Innovium acquisition. We are also excited about the setup for growth beyond fiscal 2023. At our Investor Day, you heard us describe our participation in end markets collectively expected to grow at a 13% CAGR. In addition, we have a number of growth drivers, which we expect will result in our revenue growing faster than our end markets. We discussed our expectations for a step-up in incremental revenue from the start of new design win ramps. We updated our expectations for revenue from cloud optimized silicon design wins to ramp to $400 million in fiscal 2024, a year earlier than prior projections. These wins are further projected to double to $800 million in revenue in fiscal 2025. In 5G, starting in fiscal 2024, we expect to benefit from an increase in content at Nokia, when we start ramping our 5-nanometer OCTEON embedded processors into their 5G base station. Over the same time frame, our auto Ethernet connectivity business is expected to make significant progress towards driving revenue over $500 million annually, and our electro-optics PAM, Coherent and ZR portfolio is also projected to remain on a high-growth trajectory. In summary, while we have been delivering strong results for multiple quarters, we are confident that we are still in the early stages of a sustained high-growth period for Marvell, and we are looking forward to reaping the benefits of the investments we have made in our business over the last few years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nJean Hu: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue in the third quarter was $1.211 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, growing 13% sequentially and 61% year-over-year. Please note the acquisition of Innovium added approximately $5 million in revenue, which was not contemplated in our original guidance for the third quarter. Revenue growth was robust from all five of our end markets. Data center remained our largest end market, driving 41% of consolidated revenue. Enterprise networking was the next largest with 20% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 18%, consumer at 15% and auto industrial at 6%. GAAP gross margin was 48.5%, which includes the remaining position of Inphi inventory step-up costs. Non-GAAP gross margin was 65.1% of revenue, exceeding the high end of our guidance range primarily due to better than expected end market revenue mix. In particular, revenue from our enterprise networking end market was significantly better than our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $621 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $371 million, which included 25 days of Innovium operating expenses of approximately $5 million. Our GAAP operating loss was $33 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $480 million, or 34.5% of revenue, an all-time record demonstrating the strong leverage in our operating model, while we continue to invest for long-term revenue growth. For the third quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.08. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.43, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance. Earnings per share grew 26% sequentially and 72% year-over-year driven by strong top line revenue momentum and execution on both gross and operating margins. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $265 million. We returned $50 million to shareholders through cash dividends. We paid down $151 million of our long-term debt during the third quarter. As of the end of the third fiscal quarter, our long-term debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was three times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $629 million. $71 million of this inventory balance is from Innovium, including $42 million in step-up cost due to purchase price accounting. We anticipate amortizing the step-up cost over the next two quarters. We have also increased our work in process inventory to support the revenue growth in revenue we are forecasting. In summary, the Marvell team executed exceptionally well, delivering accelerated top line growth and earnings expansion much faster than revenue growth. Now turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Please note this guidance includes the expected results from the Innovium business for the full quarter. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.32 billion, plus or minus 3%. We expect our GAAP gross margin in the range of 47.9% to 49.8%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 65%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $630 million to $640 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $390 million to $395 million, which include approximately $15 million of OpEx for the acquired Innovium business for the full quarter. This outlook also reflects the increase in investment to support the accelerated revenue growth we are driving across the business, including the launch of multiple new projects tied to the design wins we have discussed in prior quarters. In addition, we're including a higher amount of bonus crew given our strong operating performance well above our plan. As a reminder, looking ahead to the first fiscal quarter of 2023, due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes, our OpEx tends to increase from Q4 of fiscal year by high single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. We expect non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. We expect our basic weighted average share outstanding will be 844 million and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 861 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.03 per share on the lower end to an income of $0.04 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.48, plus or minus $0.03. Now, let me now close with some directional comments on our investment plan for the next fiscal year. As Matt mentioned earlier, we see continued strong demand across our end markets and improvement in supply to drive our top line revenue growth above 30% in fiscal 2023. To support both near-term and long-term revenue growth, we are planning to increase our investment levels appropriately, annualize the midpoint of our OpEx guidance for Q4 for fiscal 2022, which includes both Inphi and Innovium for the full period implies a $1.57 billion baseline OpEx run rate. From this baseline, we are planning for OpEx to grow in the high single digits on a percentage basis in fiscal 2023, substantially lower than our top line revenue growth. We increased our spending to execute on significant design wins and continue to drive process technology leadership as well as aggressive pursue a growing funnel of new design win opportunities within the large $30 billion we discussed at our Investor Day. We are confident we'll continue to drive strong and sustainable long-term revenue growth and deliver earnings expansion much faster than revenue growth in fiscal 2023 and beyond. Operator, please open line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Good afternoon, and great results. Maybe just a question. I know you're going to get a bunch on supply, but obviously, that seems like the biggest swing factor into the upside. So talk about that and maybe also just address the enterprise segment? Because I think that was your biggest beat and you were thinking it would be down. So just refresh my memory in terms of why you thought it would be down and maybe just a perspective on just supply in general. You said that you're signing long-term agreements. At what point do you think you'll kind of get out from under this supply constraint?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Blayne. And what I would lead off by saying is I think the two questions you asked are interrelated, meaning the enterprise strength we saw was really as a result of a pretty big catch-up in supply. So, on the topic of supply, we're really pleased with the progress. We, like a lot of other companies have been challenged to meet this unprecedented demand. And I'm very proud to say that our team has responded really well. And so a couple of factors, one is we've driven pretty big transformation in our operations group. Part of that was signing long-term supply agreements. I'd say equally meaningful, though, was the strategic nature in which we've really engaged over the last nine months with our supply chain. Our partners understand our opportunity as well as anybody now, and they're really betting on us and they're betting on Marvell. That's helped a lot. And it's just been strong execution by the team. And so, when you add it all up, really what's happened, Blayne, is the demand has continued to be very, very strong and that's continued even until now. It's really been a story of supply catching up, and what I would note is supply has caught up a lot, obviously. But to be honest, we still aren't really making a dent yet in the unfulfilled backlog that's out there. So, it's a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it's great. We're getting more supply. On the other hand, demand continues to be very strong, and we see that going into next year. But certainly, we'll take the win in Q3 and also the Q4 guide relative to the great job our team has done. And enterprise, as we noted the last time was really -- we had a very nice Q2 on enterprise. And we were able to actually do just again -- the team has done a great job to get the supply wind up to meet the strong demand. And then if you actually look into Q4, you've got enterprise up again, and really the year-over-year story is what, I think, most impressive. I mean we're talking about 60% year-over-year growth projected in our Enterprise segment. Almost all of that is organic plan, and that will continue to grow next year. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nRoss Seymore: Thanks for letting me ask the question. Matt, I wanted to dive a little bit into the guidance you gave for fiscal 2023. That was a little more detailed than I had expected, and it seems like you're exceedingly confident about the revenue growth side of it. Can you just talk a little bit more detail on -- it looks like about $5.6 billion in revenue, given the math that you said. If we took the Innovium side out, because we all have a decent idea of what's happening there, can you just talk about what the biggest drivers of that growth is going to be year-over-year? And if something happened that's increased your confidence in your ability to deliver that, whether it be the supply side coming or if you're just willing to talk more about design wins that you have kind of dropped breadcrumbs to us about over the last few calls?\nMatt Murphy: Sure. I think there's a few factors, Ross. The first is we did lay out our strategic narrative at the Investor Day. So that was one setup we tried to give investors relative to where the business was heading. Second is when we look into next year where we certainly see the demand strength continuing really across all segments. So that gives us a lot of confidence. That's data center, that's 5G, that's automotive. It's also enterprise and consumer. Those are backed up with purchase orders that are in place today. So, the backlog we have is very strong. And I think the other point is we really want \u2013 and I really wanted to contextualize the growth that we're seeing in Q3 and Q4 on an organic basis with Marvell growing 30%, Inphi growing 30-ish and that effectively continuing so that the investment community understood that this wasn't a short-term bump, but rather part of a longer period of sustained growth which we believe actually has legs even beyond next year. And then the simple math, and I'll let Jean chime in. But basically what we said is just take the pro forma $4.4 billion-ish we'll do this year, if you take our Q4 guide. We believe we'll grow that 30% next year. And then on top of that, you would add Innovium. So I think your number would be actually a little bit higher when we look out to next year.\nOperator: The next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on the very strong growth and the execution. I actually wanted to talk about the OpEx side. If I look in the last year, you\u2019ve basically added almost $500 million in sales and OpEx has just grown about $100 million. And when I look at the guidance you are providing for next year also, that also suggests very strong leverage in the model and EBIT margins that can get into the high 30s. So, I'm curious, Matt or Jean, what's helping drive the leverage? How are you adding almost $1.5 billion plus in sales while keeping OpEx at these levels? How sustainable is this trajectory of expanding margins?\nMatthew Murphy: Sure. Maybe I'll start, Jean, and do you want to \u2013 actually, why don't you start, Jean? Go ahead.\nJean Hu: Yes, I'll start. So if you look at our investment level, as we discussed during the Investor Day, we have a strong leverage because not only our central engineering team really leverage across all the different end markets, we also focused on the cloud optimized silicon solutions and work with the customers. So we do partner with the customers to get the customer funding, too. Overall, if you look at the R&D investment, we have been doing plus the NRE we get from customer actually is significantly larger.  So I would say, our team significantly leveraged the investment across all different advanced process node and also across different end markets. That helps us tremendously. And if you look at the OpEx increase, of course, we acquired both Inphi and Innovium. Year-over-year, it actually is going to get to almost $1.7 billion. That's very much within the target model we are focusing on as our long-term business model. So it's the leverage that helps us tremendously.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. I think that was well said by Jean.\nOperator: The next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks. Jean, inventory was up about $100 million, if I exclude Innovium. And you did talk a lot about this being WIP and the fact that you're taking WIP up given how much you think you can grow. But I guess the question is really on your visibility on revenue. And I guess I'm surprised that you were able to build that much inventory and maybe you can talk about whether delinquencies got any better. Thank you.\nJean Hu: Yes. Actually, we have improved the supply significantly. However, demand continued to outpace the supply. So we have not made a dent on the delinquency we have as a company. As Matt discussed earlier, if you look at the fiscal 2023, we see strong demand, a significant revenue ramp across all our end markets with our unique product cycles. So 30% -- over 30% year-over-year growth literally. As a matter of fact, if we look into Q1 sequentially, seasonally it will be a down quarter. But for the coming Q1 fiscal 2023, we actually see sequentially revenue increase, approaching mid-single-digit on the basis of a very strong guide for Q4. So the inventory build primarily they are all work in process inventory to support not only Q1 revenue growth and beyond the Q1 for the sequential quarter-over-quarter increase in the next year to support the over 30% top line revenue growth.\nOperator: The next question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon guys. Congratulations and thanks for letting me ask the question. Matt, one of the key strengths of your businesses is that the design cycles for a lot of your products are fairly long and fairly visible. And I would argue that revenue growth that you have confidence in next year, notwithstanding some of the supply constraints was based upon design wins that you've had for a while. I'm just kind of curious, can you talk about the design pipeline and the momentum in the design pipeline today and how you expect it to progress through next year? And my guess is it's going to continue to be strong, if not accelerate. And if that's the case, not wanting to get too far out in front of you, the long-term growth rate you put out in the Analyst Day, why wouldn't that just move up structurally higher? I know it's less than a quarter 4 since you did that. But if you could give us some sense of how you're feeling around the design pipeline?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. John, it's a great question. I think the way I would answer it is, you are correct in that the design cycles our products are quite long actually, and -- but they also come with very long visibility as well. So the revenue that we've got for next year, those designs are done. I mean they've been done for in some cases for a year, as an example, like in automotive. So then you got to go back a couple of years and say, well, what is the design win funnel and pipeline and closure rate look like, say, two years ago or three years ago? And then what is that translating to? What I would comment on is our design win funnel and close rate in the last three years has gone up dramatically each year. And this current year on track for our sales team is on track for a beyond record design win capture. So the design wins are growing each year. That is a great leading indicator for us, for sure. And I think to your other question about the long term, look, we did our Analyst Day, we put on a long-term model. There will be ups and downs if you take a long-term view. But I think what we're saying is at least in the short term, i.e., Q3, Q4, also FY 2023 and we believe even beyond, we can run above that model, and we're very bullish on our business.\nOperator: The next question will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. Let me echo congratulations. I had a question on 5G. You're expecting 30% sequential growth in the January quarter. Could you just elaborate a little bit on what's driving that? I do know you have some \u2013 some new customer design wins that are ramping and content growth, but especially as we think of it from a sort of regional deployment perspective. Any more color you could share with us would be great. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure, Tore. To your point, yeah, we had, last quarter, said and signaled that we anticipated a step-up from Q3 to Q4 in our 5G business. Now we've quantified it, which we see a growing 30% sequential. So great step-up, great validation of the thesis in that business and what's exciting, I guess, is it's primarily driven by new product ramps at some of the key customers, particularly in the baseband area and then also geographies ex-China deploying 5G. So \u2013 and we see that growing pretty strongly throughout FY 2023, our 5G business as we're highly diversified, both by customer, by geographies that those customer service and then by the content which we have, most of which is still in front of us. If you think about one of our biggest opportunities is really the transport processor area where we've won an additional customer we outlined a few years ago. That's going to ramp in 2023 calendar. So there's a nice layering effect Tore, but I would say, it's certainly nice to see a one quarter step-up, but we certainly see growth from here. You've got US, you've got Europe and there's a lot of optimism around India as well next year. So I think the geographic mix is in our favor as well.\nOperator: The next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon and congratulations on the strong results and execution. I would assume that, 16-nanometer is sort of the workhorse volume technology now. The team's 7-nanometer products are ramping strongly, where you've got 200 and 400-gig Polaris and Porrima PAM4 products. You've got your Canopus 7-nanometer DSP for data center interconnect ramping. And then on top of that, your 5-nanometer pipeline is quite strong. What I think you guys said at the Analyst Day, you have 20 tape-ups over the next 18 months. And I think the team has already been sampling a number of different 5-nanometer products. So when does the team expect 5-nanometer revenues to become a material part as the revenue mix? Is it calendar year 2022? Is it more likely 2023? And are the first meaningful 5-nanometer revenues going to be more cloud focused or carrier focused?\nMatt Murphy: Sure, Harlan. Yeah, I think what I'd frame your question around the process technology road map, where is Marvell today, and you're right. Some of those examples are spot on relative to some of the optical components, et cetera. But we've got a diversity of process technologies that we use. Some of those came from different acquisitions. But you're in the ballpark. I think where it leads to is really 5-nanometer, where in the case of the kind of classic Marvell business, we effectively skipped 7, right? So there was a big investment in 5. That is going to be led by carrier in 5G. That's where the initial ramps will occur. Those products are getting ready to go to production. So we'll see revenue in calendar 2022 on 5-nanometer for our OCTEON products. But that's the initial ramp phase. It will really kick in more in 2023 and 2024. And then you'll see some of the DPU products and then a whole host of other 5-nanometer products really hit the market kind of in that 2022, 2023 time frame. Effectively, the entire company road map has converged on this 5 platform from storage to networking to -- even the Inphi business is going to move there and take advantage. And so a little bit pursuant to Vivek's question earlier, we just -- we get tremendous leverage out of this process and technology platform that we put together that we actually articulated even a couple of years ago at our 2020 Investor Day. And that's really paying dividends relative to managing the OpEx efficiently and being able to take out a significant number of designs in 5-nanometer that are going to last for a very, very long time. But certainly, it will be 5G first, then carrier. And then you're going to see all the other markets, enterprise, automotive, optical, you name it. So this has got a lot of legs behind it.\nOperator: The next question will come from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to clarify on the supply side and then ask a question on auto. So on the supply side, as you indicated in terms of roughly $5.9-plus billion for fiscal 2023, are you saying that you secured that and then some? Or can you give us some clarity there? And then your commentary on the auto compute side very intriguing. I would love to hear more, Matt, in terms of how we should be thinking about the timing of sort of initial design wins and when that should start to materially hit the model? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes. On the first question on supply, yes, we feel good about that range we gave for next year. Certainly, there's still a lot of moving pieces, and we've got a lot of execution in front of us. This is not a lay-up. Things have not eased up. It's not like all of a sudden supply has loosened. And what I would say is that the growth next year really just comprehends kind of keeping up with demand. There's still going to be some unsupported backlog probably that we can't quite get to. So we're working on that as a potential as well. But we certainly feel good about the 30% growth and that growth rate continuing, which is really where we were in Q3. That's where we're going to be in Q4. And what we're saying is we anticipate we can keep growing our revenues at that rate when you look out to next year. But obviously, we're going to try to do even better. On the automotive compute side, yes, it's pretty new. It's a little bit like some of our other markets where we gave some initial indications as we were gaining traction and then the story evolves from there. But yes, I'd say we're well underway on our first design and the level of activity going on with the automotive OEMs around this topic is kind of off the charts at this point. I think there's such a \u2013 it's almost like a \u2013 there's a renaissance C.J., I think, in what I would call the infotainment age, when automotive OEMs really embrace these consumer technologies and all of a sudden, you've got things like USB chargers in your car. You've got state-of-the-art audio. You got touchscreens. This consumer tech went in. That had a big benefit to semiconductor companies. What we've been saying for a while, and it's coming true now, is that the data-centric semiconductor products and IPs will be the next wave of growth. We're seeing that in our networking products now, but it's very much moving to a compute-centric discussion. And there's a whole bunch of ways to skin that cat, but our model will be unique in that we're approaching it very similarly C.J. to what we do in the cloud market, which is coming in with a broad IP portfolio, partnership-oriented model, build what somebody wants, let them put their stamp on it if they want to and really customize and optimize for their particular system and use case and bring all the goodness of all the Marvell IPs with it. So it's pretty interesting discussions. There'll be more to come there, but we think this is going to be a very large long-term opportunity for the company.\nOperator: The next question will come from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nMark Lipacis: Thanks for taking my question. Matt, if I think about the kind of portfolio of assets that you kind of pulled together here, I think about you have interconnect capabilities with Inphi, processing capabilities with Cavium, networking capabilities from Innovium and native Marvell. And I'm wondering to what extent as your customers are coming to you for semi-custom solutions, are they asking you to deliver solutions to them that are a mix of two or more of those kind of different capabilities. And so that would be the question for your customers as well as like how you're thinking about delivering complete optimized computing solution on the merchant side. And maybe as part of that, could you just \u2013 as you have embrace the semi-custom model, can you share with us your view, like what does Marvell look like pick the time, 3, 5, 10 years down the line? What is a merchant model versus a semi-custom model? What \u2013 how do your revenues split along those dimensions? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes, Mark, I think you highlighted it well. There's a pretty incredible set of assets inside the company now that I would argue is very unique in terms of all of these being under one roof. I would actually add there's even more. I think you gave three great examples. I would say our security IP, storage and I/O. And you're absolutely right, when we engage in our various business models, whether it's a full custom design or, call it, a semi-custom partnership design with a mix of IP from the customer and ours, every one of those IPs gets put on the table. And we gave an example actually in the prepared remarks about the storage accelerator opportunity, where it's not just a storage product, it's got CPUs, it's got security and it's got some pretty advanced network interfaces, especially when you talk about things like going from NVMe to Ethernet as an example. So very unique, and it's part of our value prop and the fact also that we can do this under one roof. And despite the fact that a lot of these IPs we have or these people we have come from other companies, it's a one Marvell culture in our company. And so when we go and engage, this doesn't look like 12 business units or, oh, there's the Cavium team. I don't know if somebody has to go work with them and there's the Innovium team. There's one integrated go-to-market strategy and technology platform, and it's very powerful. And I think it's going to become even more and more relevant. And I would say, we don't really think about our business, Mark, at this point between pure merchant, pure semi-custom, pure custom. I mean there's all these different business models in-between. And even our merchant products, what we're finding, like let me give you an example in storage. We end up doing a fair degree, for example, on our high-end data center class SSD controllers now. We're doing a fair amount of customization, particularly on the firmware and the software, as an example, for each individual customer that makes it very, very sticky. And occasionally, we'll spend a metal option off and we'll give them a certain feature that they want or need. But yes, in a way, a lot of our business already today is effectively customized in the standpoint that we've really optimized it for the application. And that could be in the hardware or it could be in the software and the firmware. So I think that that those lines are fairly blurred now is what I would say, Mark, and I think it's good. I think it enables us to stay flexible, and it's enabling us to win new accounts.\nOperator: The next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Matt, a couple of clarifications actually. First, on the pricing, I think you mentioned that you've implemented some pricing actions to offset the higher input costs. I'm just curious where we are in that process and how broadly you're implementing those and to what extent that might be helping the top line as we go into next year. And then the second part of the question is obviously a very strong outlook for next year. I'm just curious, given your breadth of products and end markets that you participate in, I'm guessing there's probably not going to be much seasonality, but I'd love to hear your thoughts on first half versus second half in terms of how you view the top line playing out next year? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. How about this? I'll take the first one, and then I'll let Jean talk about the second one. Yes. So on the first one, so let me take you back on pricing. It was about this time a year ago when I got a call from our ops team that said we have some serious issues because we're getting a number of price cost increases from a whole bunch of our different suppliers overseas and what are we going to do? And this is like what. And I spent the month of December negotiating higher cost increases by my supply chain a year ago. And we then worked and managed to pass those through earlier than the year. Each time we've secured additional capacities, Srini, we end up in a lot of cases, having to bear a higher input cost. That's been part of the drill as supply has come available. And so I would say that this has been a gradual process. It's gone on throughout the year. It continues to go on. I think there continues to be inflation in the supply chain. And our philosophy has been to be real fair about that, be very partner-oriented, not take advantage of it. And so while it has flowed through the top line throughout the year, the biggest benefit of the growth we're seeing, it's just the raw demand, the design wins, the value that we're capturing. And certainly, there's a slight tailwind on the top-line but it's almost all from demand. And we certainly see that trend continuing through next year. Jean, do you want to cover the view of 2023?\nJean Hu: To just follow what Matt just said, right, next year, we see strong demand across all our end markets. Frankly, it's a supply constraint when we talk about over 30% revenue growth. That's a supply-constrained outlook of what we're looking at. So the normal seasonality definitely does not apply here. We see Q1 sequentially on a very strong Q4 base to increase approaching mid-single digit. And after Q1, we will see continuous sequential increase. Supply dynamics is certainly something our team will continue to drive. But absolutely, if we have more supply, we definitely have more demand. We can ship more products to customers. So you should expect we see sequential increase each quarter for the rest of the next year.\nOperator: The next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Rolland: Thank you for the question. Fantastic update in the quarter. I was going to dig in on the hyperscale custom silicon side as well. Maybe if you guys could talk about \u2013 in terms of your outlook, your big outlook there? How many of, let's say, the top seven big hyperscalers are you guys engaging? And it was kind of touched on, but storage versus networking and optics, where are you guys getting the most interest? I think you kind of covered that. But \u2013 and then finally, this is probably too much to ask for. But in the past, we've had some NREs associated with these hyperscalers? Are those NREs still coming in? Or are you guys on your own?\nMatt Murphy: Sure. I think on the first question, I would say, we're engaged broadly. The opportunity and the activity, though is primarily centered around the big four in the US. That's where the technology leadership is. That's where the thought leadership is. But we are \u2013 and I think that's where the biggest drivers of our growth are going to come from. I think a lot of the others will follow. And so I think there's leverage we're going to be able to get from that, but we're very well engaged across the board. And when we say custom, you're right, it's certainly custom compute silicon for different types of workloads and applications but also storage, networking, optics. It's quite a broad range of technologies that we engage with and security as well. On the NRE front, that continues to be healthy. And that's not just a hyperscale story, that's really broad-based across all of our businesses. And we get actually really good visibility because when we start developing these products, custom, semi-custom, whatever the model is, there's a development agreement that comes with that. They're milestone based. Customer wants to have \u2013 wants to have teeth. They want to have skin in the game, so do we. So that's typically where the NRE then gets mapped out over a fairly long period in some cases. So we have a nice road map and a view. And Jean's team actually does a great job of being able to forecast the NRE and manage it, and it continues to grow. That's part of the leverage that we're getting into next year is the OpEx is going to grow, but also the NRE is going to grow. So that's enabling us to we get kind of a double whammy, right? Because while we're growing our OpEx, and we're hiring people and we're staffing up, we're growing the NRE as well. And so think of that as this incremental spend we've got that's not completely visible, but yet contains very important engineering resource and R&D resource that gets deployed towards high ROI projects that spit out several years later. And so it's a really -- I think it's a virtuous cycle. And our team has done a really good job of managing that as part of the business model. I would -- on the final kind of example, on the automotive compute design win, we talked about, it is heavily funded by R&D -- by NRE, excuse me. And again, that's a multi-year project. And it's so critical. I mean, you basically can't build a car without it. So you got to imagine, it's going to be really important to have a real significant contract around that and for us to have a significant co-funding to make it happen. So it's a pretty important part of the business model, Chris, and it continues to be healthy. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question will come from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Please go ahead.\nQuinn Bolton: Thanks for squeezing me in. Hey, Matt, you gave us a great outlook through fiscal 2023. But as you looked out beyond fiscal 2023, I think you mentioned you see another big step-up in the 5G business at Nokia, the 5-nanometer platform starts to ramp. I'm just wondering, can you give us a sense, is that step-up really Marvell capturing even greater content on your current share of base station to that customer? Or do you think your 5-nanometer platform is allowing you to grab greater share that customer as the 5-nanometer platforms ramp? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Okay. Let me give you a broader answer and then I'll dive into the 5G. So just as you think about the growth from fiscal 2023, next year to fiscal 2024, the biggest overall growth actually in step-up is in the cloud. And you remember, Quinn, at the Investor Day, we outlined this sort of very strong design win activity we had, which was going to result in the $400 million incremental revenue in fiscal 2024 from cloud and then going to doubling again the year after. So that -- when you think of a step-up, that's where that's coming from. 5G is also kind of right behind, and that's going to be very strong as well. And to your point, one of our key partners and customers there is Nokia, as you mentioned. That in 5-nanometer is where we not only support them on their ambitions around baseband, but also on the CPU side and transport processing side. And so that is content gain. That is new for us that starts at that time. That's all been planned. That's been all kind of going well and tracking to what we thought. But I thought it was important to note that the timing around that and highlight that we have more legs even in 5G beyond next year, because that will just really be the first full year of production there. So actually, we won't even peak for years after. So, really strong outlook on cloud and 5G in fiscal 2024 and beyond. And then, of course, you got the automotive story layering in and all that drives a lot of goodness in the model.\nOperator: The next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you for squeezing me in, and congratulations on the very strong results. Matt, I wanted to ask about the enterprise networking business. You talked a little bit about your share growth in Ethernet, I believe. I was hoping you could elaborate on that a little bit. What's driving the success? And if you can speak to sustainability there. And then as my second part, again, sticking to enterprise networking, I think all of us appreciate the secular nature of your business in data center and 5G and auto and industrial. I guess, enterprise networking is perhaps at least on a relative basis, a little bit more cyclical in nature. With the business growing kind of in the 50% to 60% range year-over-year, how should we think about sustainability of growth as we transition into 2022? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yeah. So maybe I'll answer it in two pieces. The first is you're probably asking is, well, what happened? Why? How did you guys do this? And I think if you look back, we've had a commitment to enterprise, okay, from day one, when I became CEO. We never milked the cow. We never took this market for granted. And most of this growth, as you noted, is organic Marvell, right? So this comes from our Ethernet switch team, which really focused on leadership products, latest process node, very strong software capability from our switch business unit and a real focus on the enterprise market, in new products and new product development, product definition. So that had a huge benefit that started three or four years ago and now those designs are ramping. The second is in our Ethernet PHY transceiver business. We've also moved that from being a technology laggard to a technology leader in Ethernet PHY. And we also did an acquisition of Aquantia, which was a relatively small company when we bought it. But when we put the two teams together, the combined share that we've been able to drive has been very significant. And the road map we were able to accelerate dramatically. That's one of our product areas as an example that we're driving to 5-nanometer, okay? And then that has all kinds of integration opportunities. So customers like the road map. They like the team. They like the story. And that's now showing up. And certainly, the enterprise market is not growing at 50% a year. So you have to draw your conclusion. There's been certainly a share shift as customers have adopted our solutions. And we do believe that, this business is going to continue to grow. It will grow next year. It may not grow on the annualized basis at 50%, because you're going to start lapping at some point and we're coming off of a relatively low point from last year. But also remember, our content has gone up on each of these generations as multi-gig Ethernet becomes much more prevalent and especially as enterprises are spending again and implementing WiFi 6, which requires high-speed wired Ethernet connections at multi-gigabit we're seeing switch ports go up on multi-gig, which has our PHY attached to it plus our switches. So there's also a content story here, Toshi. So I wouldn't exactly say, well, enterprise is like a low single-digit grower and eventually, will trend back there. I think between product leadership, share gain and then content increase, enterprise can continue to be a winning business for Marvell.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as our conference call for today. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Murphy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter GAAP results. Revenue was $1.21 billion, which was above the high end of our guidance and represents another record achievement for Marvell. GAAP Gross margin was 48.5%, GAAP operating loss was $33 million, and loss per diluted share was $0.08. Revenue grew 13% sequentially and 61% year-over-year, an acceleration from the first half of this fiscal year. We saw great momentum in all five of our end markets, with revenue growing both sequentially and year-on-year. Our data center, carrier, enterprise networking, and auto industrial end markets all achieved record revenue and performed above guidance. Excellent operational and financial execution resulted in revenue 6% above the midpoint of our guidance. Our operations team continues to do a great job in sourcing incremental supply, and we are starting to see the fruits of their labor. Supply was better than expected in the third quarter, and we expect continued improvements as we move into the fourth quarter and next year. The additional capacity has better positioned us to catch up to the growth in demand, which so far has outpaced increases in supply. Moving on to our non-GAAP results for the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was a record 65.1%, and we delivered $418 million in non-GAAP operating income. Non-GAAP operating margin was also a record at 34.5%. Higher revenue, coupled with stronger gross margin drove non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.43, 13% above the midpoint of guidance growing 72% year-over-year, which represents phenomenal growth in earnings. These are tremendous accomplishments, and I am very proud of the outstanding execution by our entire Marvell team in driving such strong results. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the third quarter was $500 million, growing 15% sequentially and 109% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance. Both the standalone Marvell business and the acquired Inphi business delivered strong growth, driven by robust demand from cloud customers. I would note that our on-premise data center business also grew sequentially and year-over-year. Data center is our most diverse end market with multiple product lines contributing to sequential revenue growth. These include 200-gig and 400-gig PAM4 electro-optics, data center interconnect ZR modules, SSD and HDD controllers, cloud-optimized SoCs, and Ethernet switches. In addition to strong end-market demand, the majority of these product lines are also benefiting from the start of new product ramps, which we expect will continue to drive sustained growth. As an example, in our SSD business, we benefited from a strong ramp of DIY controllers directly to a Tier 1 cloud customer. Remember, you heard at Investor Day, Marvell has been winning a large number of incremental cloud optimized silicon designs, and these are now in development. In addition, the design win funnel and level of activity on cloud optimized silicon engagements continues to accelerate, and we have recently won another socket with our storage accelerator. At our Investor Day, we discussed this new $500 million market for our storage business and cloud storage accelerators and disclosed our first design win with the cloud customer. Now, a key storage partner, KIOXIA, recently announced production availability of their NVMe over Fabric SSDs, which will also use our storage accelerators. These SSDs are for Ethernet Bunch of Flash systems designed for applications such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and high-performance computing. The KIOXIA SSDs connect to the network fabric natively using Ethernet by integrating a Marvell storage accelerator, which converts NVMe into 25 gigabit Ethernet. We are excited to see this new opportunity take shape with multiple customers starting to adopt our storage accelerators. Turning now to Innovium. During the quarter, we closed the acquisition, adding their cloud optimized switches to our broad data center portfolio. We're pleased that company's Co-founder and CTO, Puneet Agarwal, and the R&D team have become a part of Marvell. We are confident that our combined switch business -- businesses are now well positioned to be a strong provider of Ethernet switches to data centers, and we see an incredible opportunity ahead for Marvell in this high-growth market. We expect the acquisition of Innovium will result in $150 million in incremental revenue next fiscal year as we ramp switches into a large Tier 1 cloud customer they had won prior to the acquisition. We are also looking forward to supporting additional cloud customers such as LinkedIn, who are deploying Innovium's Teralynx-based switches in production across multiple data centers with the SONiC network OS. SONiC is an open network operating system, which provides cloud customers with more choice and interoperability as well as the ability to scale. We recently announced our commitment to supporting SONiC across both our Prestera and Teralynx products. Moving on to our expectations for revenue from our data center end market in our fourth fiscal quarter. Similar to the third quarter, we are expecting another strong performance led by cloud customers across a broad range of products. We expect data center revenue to more than double from a year ago, and we project sequential growth in the double digits on a percentage basis in the fourth quarter. We are pleased with the strength we are seeing from the cloud end market, which we expect will remain a strong driver of sustained growth for Marvell. Looking out further in time, we are also excited by the immense potential for another phase of growth as large-scale virtual environments such as Facebook is doing with their metaverse start to gain traction. For simplicity, while I will use the metaverse as a general descriptor for this discussion, we expect many different implementations of virtual environments enabled by a broad set of companies and ecosystems. Regardless of the form these environments take, the data sets will be exponentially larger compared to the current Internet, which is largely two-dimensional and latency will need to be extremely low to realistically simulate a real-world environment. As a result, we expect the metaverse will significantly accelerate a number of key trends, which are already occurring in the cloud today, including the need to store huge amounts of data in a secure environment, connected by high-speed, electro-optic links to custom compute engines. This next level of massive scaling makes the metaverse an even stronger candidate for cloud optimized silicon solutions that Marvell is currently enabling. This meshes perfectly with the core competencies we have already developed across compute, storage, security, networking, high-speed electro-optics and customization, which are driving our current success. And these are equally applicable to the variety of virtual environments, which we will develop over time. The metaverse also has the potential to be a killer app for 5G, another area of strength for Marvell. Multiple cloud customers have already engaged with us, as they start designing the architecture of their next generation of data infrastructure to enable a significantly richer set of virtual applications and experiences. Turning now to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $215 million, growing 9% sequentially and 28% year-over-year, exceeding our guidance. Growth was driven by our 5G products ramping at multiple customers. We are also able to improve supply for our wired business to enable sequential growth. Looking at the fourth quarter, we expect a strong ramp in our 5G business of approximately 30% sequentially. And as a result, we project our combined carrier infrastructure revenue across our wireless and wired end sequentially in the low-teens on a percentage basis, while year-on-year growth is expected to accelerate to over 40%. It's exciting to see the step-up in our 5G business, and we expect significant additional growth over the next several years as 5G adoption continues to grow around the globe, combined with Marvell content gains from designs we have won, but not yet begun to ramp. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $247 million, growing 11% sequentially and 56% year-over-year, with the majority of the growth coming from standalone Marvell products. This performance was significantly better than our expectations as our operations team did an excellent job securing additional supply to better address the increase in demand for our products. From a product perspective, in the third quarter, the continuation of strong year-on-year growth was driven primarily by Marvell's Ethernet networking portfolio. We have been gaining share and benefiting from the very deliberate investments we have made in our enterprise Ethernet switch platform as well as the combined Marvell and the Quantify portfolio. In addition, our content has been growing driven by increase in multi-gig Ethernet adoption. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter for our enterprise networking end market, we project revenue sequentially to be up in the low to mid-single digits on a percentage basis and year-over-year growth is expected to remain very strong at approximately 60%. We expect this strong growth to be driven by continued share gains from Marvell products combined with ongoing recovery in the enterprise networking end market. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market, which is served primarily by stand-alone Marvell businesses. Revenue for the third quarter was $67 million, growing 16% sequentially and 114% year-over-year, driven by ongoing ramps in our auto business. I'm pleased to report that our team has now driven our auto business to over $140 million annualized revenue run rate in the third quarter, ahead of our prior expectations. We are benefiting from a faster pace of adoption of our Ethernet solutions by auto OEMs, who are prioritizing the production of their latest models, which tend to have higher semiconductor content. We are confident that we are well on our way to driving a multi-hundred million dollar revenue stream from our -- auto Ethernet business over the next few years. Looking beyond connectivity, our next multibillion-dollar market opportunity for Marvell is in automotive compute. A future of technology in cars is all about electrification and intelligence with embedded security and onboard storage in a fully networked environment. Similar to the rise of optimized silicon and cloud, automotive OEMs are realizing that to differentiate their products and deliver the most value to their customers, they need unique technology and IP to be embedded in compute silicon optimized to their specific platforms. You don't need to look too far to see evidence for the sea change. Recent industry commentary, including from Ford and Volkswagen, talks about their focus on developing internal silicon design expertise, desire to customize off-the-shelf compute and their intentions to design and develop their own shifts for autonomous vehicles. Similar to our successful strategy of partnering with hyperscale customers for cloud-optimized silicon, we are confident that our co-development business model and rich IP portfolio is equally attractive to automotive OEMs. In this model, the design is done in true partnership with the customer focusing on the portions proprietary to their platform and Marvell bringing our own unique compute, security, Ethernet networking and storage silicon IP to the table. The end solution is a semi-custom design, which represents the best of both worlds, allowing our customers to achieve their ambitions and retain control of their roadmap. In doing so, they can not only preserve their differentiation with a faster time to market, but it will also enable a lower level of investment, thanks to Marvell. We see compute becoming an increasingly important part of our growing automotive business, adding to our very successful Ethernet connectivity solutions. Reflecting this broadening of our portfolio, I'm very pleased to introduce Marvell's new brand for Automotive Solutions, Brightlane, which includes our gigabit and multi-gigabit Ethernet switches and PHYs for connectivity and our OCTEON processors for compute. At our Investor Day, we had discussed our first major auto compute win based on our OCTEON Brightlane platform. The semi-custom design is now in development. We are seeing a significant increase in compute related activity with additional auto OEMs, both traditional and new market entrants. And I look forward to updating you on our progress in this exciting new long-term growth pillar for Marvell. Turning to the outlook for the fourth fiscal quarter for our auto and industrial end market. We expect strong revenue growth to continue. We project sequential growth in the double digits on a percentage basis and year-over-year growth to remain above 100%. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $183 million, growing 10% sequentially and 20% year-over-year. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially in the low single digits on a percentage basis and year-on-year growth in the double digits on a percentage basis. We are benefiting from strong growth driven by our SSD controllers that we have targeted a differentiated sticky, long-lived and high ROI applications such as game consoles. In closing, we delivered very strong results for our third quarter, and we expect this momentum to continue in our fourth quarter and next year. Both the acquired Inphi business and the standalone Marvell business are firing on all cylinders. In the third quarter, the stand-alone Marvell business delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth close to 30%. The Inphi business performed even better. The midpoint of our guidance for revenue in the fourth quarter implies a similar approximately 30% year-over-year growth rate for each of these businesses. We are proud of these results and our outlook for growth in the fourth quarter, which is well above the high end of our long-term revenue growth target of a 15% to 20% CAGR. Securing capacity for growth remains the highest priority for our operations team even as the supply expansion comes with an increase in input costs. As we have done throughout the supply crunch, we are working with our customers to adjust prices to offset the impact of these cost increases, which led us jointly benefit from sustained growth. As we look at next fiscal year, we will continue to drive supply improvements, and we expect demand to remain above the high-end of our long-term target mode. As a result, we anticipate a sustained period of strong revenue growth for Marvell. From a base of approximately $4.4 billion in fiscal 2022, we expect the combined Marvell and Inphi business to continue growing in fiscal 2023 at the 30% year-on-year rate we are currently achieving. On top of this, we expect an additional $150 million of revenue in fiscal 2023, resulting from the Innovium acquisition. We are also excited about the setup for growth beyond fiscal 2023. At our Investor Day, you heard us describe our participation in end markets collectively expected to grow at a 13% CAGR. In addition, we have a number of growth drivers, which we expect will result in our revenue growing faster than our end markets. We discussed our expectations for a step-up in incremental revenue from the start of new design win ramps. We updated our expectations for revenue from cloud optimized silicon design wins to ramp to $400 million in fiscal 2024, a year earlier than prior projections. These wins are further projected to double to $800 million in revenue in fiscal 2025. In 5G, starting in fiscal 2024, we expect to benefit from an increase in content at Nokia, when we start ramping our 5-nanometer OCTEON embedded processors into their 5G base station. Over the same time frame, our auto Ethernet connectivity business is expected to make significant progress towards driving revenue over $500 million annually, and our electro-optics PAM, Coherent and ZR portfolio is also projected to remain on a high-growth trajectory. In summary, while we have been delivering strong results for multiple quarters, we are confident that we are still in the early stages of a sustained high-growth period for Marvell, and we are looking forward to reaping the benefits of the investments we have made in our business over the last few years. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Yes. Thanks, Blayne. And what I would lead off by saying is I think the two questions you asked are interrelated, meaning the enterprise strength we saw was really as a result of a pretty big catch-up in supply. So, on the topic of supply, we're really pleased with the progress. We, like a lot of other companies have been challenged to meet this unprecedented demand. And I'm very proud to say that our team has responded really well. And so a couple of factors, one is we've driven pretty big transformation in our operations group. Part of that was signing long-term supply agreements. I'd say equally meaningful, though, was the strategic nature in which we've really engaged over the last nine months with our supply chain. Our partners understand our opportunity as well as anybody now, and they're really betting on us and they're betting on Marvell. That's helped a lot. And it's just been strong execution by the team. And so, when you add it all up, really what's happened, Blayne, is the demand has continued to be very, very strong and that's continued even until now. It's really been a story of supply catching up, and what I would note is supply has caught up a lot, obviously. But to be honest, we still aren't really making a dent yet in the unfulfilled backlog that's out there. So, it's a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it's great. We're getting more supply. On the other hand, demand continues to be very strong, and we see that going into next year. But certainly, we'll take the win in Q3 and also the Q4 guide relative to the great job our team has done. And enterprise, as we noted the last time was really -- we had a very nice Q2 on enterprise. And we were able to actually do just again -- the team has done a great job to get the supply wind up to meet the strong demand. And then if you actually look into Q4, you've got enterprise up again, and really the year-over-year story is what, I think, most impressive. I mean we're talking about 60% year-over-year growth projected in our Enterprise segment. Almost all of that is organic plan, and that will continue to grow next year. Thanks. Sure. I think there's a few factors, Ross. The first is we did lay out our strategic narrative at the Investor Day. So that was one setup we tried to give investors relative to where the business was heading. Second is when we look into next year where we certainly see the demand strength continuing really across all segments. So that gives us a lot of confidence. That's data center, that's 5G, that's automotive. It's also enterprise and consumer. Those are backed up with purchase orders that are in place today. So, the backlog we have is very strong. And I think the other point is we really want \u2013 and I really wanted to contextualize the growth that we're seeing in Q3 and Q4 on an organic basis with Marvell growing 30%, Inphi growing 30-ish and that effectively continuing so that the investment community understood that this wasn't a short-term bump, but rather part of a longer period of sustained growth which we believe actually has legs even beyond next year. And then the simple math, and I'll let Jean chime in. But basically what we said is just take the pro forma $4.4 billion-ish we'll do this year, if you take our Q4 guide. We believe we'll grow that 30% next year. And then on top of that, you would add Innovium. So I think your number would be actually a little bit higher when we look out to next year. Yes. I think that was well said by Jean. Yes. John, it's a great question. I think the way I would answer it is, you are correct in that the design cycles our products are quite long actually, and -- but they also come with very long visibility as well. So the revenue that we've got for next year, those designs are done. I mean they've been done for in some cases for a year, as an example, like in automotive. So then you got to go back a couple of years and say, well, what is the design win funnel and pipeline and closure rate look like, say, two years ago or three years ago? And then what is that translating to? What I would comment on is our design win funnel and close rate in the last three years has gone up dramatically each year. And this current year on track for our sales team is on track for a beyond record design win capture. So the design wins are growing each year. That is a great leading indicator for us, for sure. And I think to your other question about the long term, look, we did our Analyst Day, we put on a long-term model. There will be ups and downs if you take a long-term view. But I think what we're saying is at least in the short term, i.e., Q3, Q4, also FY 2023 and we believe even beyond, we can run above that model, and we're very bullish on our business. Sure, Tore. To your point, yeah, we had, last quarter, said and signaled that we anticipated a step-up from Q3 to Q4 in our 5G business. Now we've quantified it, which we see a growing 30% sequential. So great step-up, great validation of the thesis in that business and what's exciting, I guess, is it's primarily driven by new product ramps at some of the key customers, particularly in the baseband area and then also geographies ex-China deploying 5G. So \u2013 and we see that growing pretty strongly throughout FY 2023, our 5G business as we're highly diversified, both by customer, by geographies that those customer service and then by the content which we have, most of which is still in front of us. If you think about one of our biggest opportunities is really the transport processor area where we've won an additional customer we outlined a few years ago. That's going to ramp in 2023 calendar. So there's a nice layering effect Tore, but I would say, it's certainly nice to see a one quarter step-up, but we certainly see growth from here. You've got US, you've got Europe and there's a lot of optimism around India as well next year. So I think the geographic mix is in our favor as well. Sure, Harlan. Yeah, I think what I'd frame your question around the process technology road map, where is Marvell today, and you're right. Some of those examples are spot on relative to some of the optical components, et cetera. But we've got a diversity of process technologies that we use. Some of those came from different acquisitions. But you're in the ballpark. I think where it leads to is really 5-nanometer, where in the case of the kind of classic Marvell business, we effectively skipped 7, right? So there was a big investment in 5. That is going to be led by carrier in 5G. That's where the initial ramps will occur. Those products are getting ready to go to production. So we'll see revenue in calendar 2022 on 5-nanometer for our OCTEON products. But that's the initial ramp phase. It will really kick in more in 2023 and 2024. And then you'll see some of the DPU products and then a whole host of other 5-nanometer products really hit the market kind of in that 2022, 2023 time frame. Effectively, the entire company road map has converged on this 5 platform from storage to networking to -- even the Inphi business is going to move there and take advantage. And so a little bit pursuant to Vivek's question earlier, we just -- we get tremendous leverage out of this process and technology platform that we put together that we actually articulated even a couple of years ago at our 2020 Investor Day. And that's really paying dividends relative to managing the OpEx efficiently and being able to take out a significant number of designs in 5-nanometer that are going to last for a very, very long time. But certainly, it will be 5G first, then carrier. And then you're going to see all the other markets, enterprise, automotive, optical, you name it. So this has got a lot of legs behind it. Sure. Yes. On the first question on supply, yes, we feel good about that range we gave for next year. Certainly, there's still a lot of moving pieces, and we've got a lot of execution in front of us. This is not a lay-up. Things have not eased up. It's not like all of a sudden supply has loosened. And what I would say is that the growth next year really just comprehends kind of keeping up with demand. There's still going to be some unsupported backlog probably that we can't quite get to. So we're working on that as a potential as well. But we certainly feel good about the 30% growth and that growth rate continuing, which is really where we were in Q3. That's where we're going to be in Q4. And what we're saying is we anticipate we can keep growing our revenues at that rate when you look out to next year. But obviously, we're going to try to do even better. On the automotive compute side, yes, it's pretty new. It's a little bit like some of our other markets where we gave some initial indications as we were gaining traction and then the story evolves from there. But yes, I'd say we're well underway on our first design and the level of activity going on with the automotive OEMs around this topic is kind of off the charts at this point. I think there's such a \u2013 it's almost like a \u2013 there's a renaissance C.J., I think, in what I would call the infotainment age, when automotive OEMs really embrace these consumer technologies and all of a sudden, you've got things like USB chargers in your car. You've got state-of-the-art audio. You got touchscreens. This consumer tech went in. That had a big benefit to semiconductor companies. What we've been saying for a while, and it's coming true now, is that the data-centric semiconductor products and IPs will be the next wave of growth. We're seeing that in our networking products now, but it's very much moving to a compute-centric discussion. And there's a whole bunch of ways to skin that cat, but our model will be unique in that we're approaching it very similarly C.J. to what we do in the cloud market, which is coming in with a broad IP portfolio, partnership-oriented model, build what somebody wants, let them put their stamp on it if they want to and really customize and optimize for their particular system and use case and bring all the goodness of all the Marvell IPs with it. So it's pretty interesting discussions. There'll be more to come there, but we think this is going to be a very large long-term opportunity for the company. Sure. Yes, Mark, I think you highlighted it well. There's a pretty incredible set of assets inside the company now that I would argue is very unique in terms of all of these being under one roof. I would actually add there's even more. I think you gave three great examples. I would say our security IP, storage and I/O. And you're absolutely right, when we engage in our various business models, whether it's a full custom design or, call it, a semi-custom partnership design with a mix of IP from the customer and ours, every one of those IPs gets put on the table. And we gave an example actually in the prepared remarks about the storage accelerator opportunity, where it's not just a storage product, it's got CPUs, it's got security and it's got some pretty advanced network interfaces, especially when you talk about things like going from NVMe to Ethernet as an example. So very unique, and it's part of our value prop and the fact also that we can do this under one roof. And despite the fact that a lot of these IPs we have or these people we have come from other companies, it's a one Marvell culture in our company. And so when we go and engage, this doesn't look like 12 business units or, oh, there's the Cavium team. I don't know if somebody has to go work with them and there's the Innovium team. There's one integrated go-to-market strategy and technology platform, and it's very powerful. And I think it's going to become even more and more relevant. And I would say, we don't really think about our business, Mark, at this point between pure merchant, pure semi-custom, pure custom. I mean there's all these different business models in-between. And even our merchant products, what we're finding, like let me give you an example in storage. We end up doing a fair degree, for example, on our high-end data center class SSD controllers now. We're doing a fair amount of customization, particularly on the firmware and the software, as an example, for each individual customer that makes it very, very sticky. And occasionally, we'll spend a metal option off and we'll give them a certain feature that they want or need. But yes, in a way, a lot of our business already today is effectively customized in the standpoint that we've really optimized it for the application. And that could be in the hardware or it could be in the software and the firmware. So I think that that those lines are fairly blurred now is what I would say, Mark, and I think it's good. I think it enables us to stay flexible, and it's enabling us to win new accounts. Sure. How about this? I'll take the first one, and then I'll let Jean talk about the second one. Yes. So on the first one, so let me take you back on pricing. It was about this time a year ago when I got a call from our ops team that said we have some serious issues because we're getting a number of price cost increases from a whole bunch of our different suppliers overseas and what are we going to do? And this is like what. And I spent the month of December negotiating higher cost increases by my supply chain a year ago. And we then worked and managed to pass those through earlier than the year. Each time we've secured additional capacities, Srini, we end up in a lot of cases, having to bear a higher input cost. That's been part of the drill as supply has come available. And so I would say that this has been a gradual process. It's gone on throughout the year. It continues to go on. I think there continues to be inflation in the supply chain. And our philosophy has been to be real fair about that, be very partner-oriented, not take advantage of it. And so while it has flowed through the top line throughout the year, the biggest benefit of the growth we're seeing, it's just the raw demand, the design wins, the value that we're capturing. And certainly, there's a slight tailwind on the top-line but it's almost all from demand. And we certainly see that trend continuing through next year. Jean, do you want to cover the view of 2023? Sure. I think on the first question, I would say, we're engaged broadly. The opportunity and the activity, though is primarily centered around the big four in the US. That's where the technology leadership is. That's where the thought leadership is. But we are \u2013 and I think that's where the biggest drivers of our growth are going to come from. I think a lot of the others will follow. And so I think there's leverage we're going to be able to get from that, but we're very well engaged across the board. And when we say custom, you're right, it's certainly custom compute silicon for different types of workloads and applications but also storage, networking, optics. It's quite a broad range of technologies that we engage with and security as well. On the NRE front, that continues to be healthy. And that's not just a hyperscale story, that's really broad-based across all of our businesses. And we get actually really good visibility because when we start developing these products, custom, semi-custom, whatever the model is, there's a development agreement that comes with that. They're milestone based. Customer wants to have \u2013 wants to have teeth. They want to have skin in the game, so do we. So that's typically where the NRE then gets mapped out over a fairly long period in some cases. So we have a nice road map and a view. And Jean's team actually does a great job of being able to forecast the NRE and manage it, and it continues to grow. That's part of the leverage that we're getting into next year is the OpEx is going to grow, but also the NRE is going to grow. So that's enabling us to we get kind of a double whammy, right? Because while we're growing our OpEx, and we're hiring people and we're staffing up, we're growing the NRE as well. And so think of that as this incremental spend we've got that's not completely visible, but yet contains very important engineering resource and R&D resource that gets deployed towards high ROI projects that spit out several years later. And so it's a really -- I think it's a virtuous cycle. And our team has done a really good job of managing that as part of the business model. I would -- on the final kind of example, on the automotive compute design win, we talked about, it is heavily funded by R&D -- by NRE, excuse me. And again, that's a multi-year project. And it's so critical. I mean, you basically can't build a car without it. So you got to imagine, it's going to be really important to have a real significant contract around that and for us to have a significant co-funding to make it happen. So it's a pretty important part of the business model, Chris, and it continues to be healthy. Thanks. Okay. Let me give you a broader answer and then I'll dive into the 5G. So just as you think about the growth from fiscal 2023, next year to fiscal 2024, the biggest overall growth actually in step-up is in the cloud. And you remember, Quinn, at the Investor Day, we outlined this sort of very strong design win activity we had, which was going to result in the $400 million incremental revenue in fiscal 2024 from cloud and then going to doubling again the year after. So that -- when you think of a step-up, that's where that's coming from. 5G is also kind of right behind, and that's going to be very strong as well. And to your point, one of our key partners and customers there is Nokia, as you mentioned. That in 5-nanometer is where we not only support them on their ambitions around baseband, but also on the CPU side and transport processing side. And so that is content gain. That is new for us that starts at that time. That's all been planned. That's been all kind of going well and tracking to what we thought. But I thought it was important to note that the timing around that and highlight that we have more legs even in 5G beyond next year, because that will just really be the first full year of production there. So actually, we won't even peak for years after. So, really strong outlook on cloud and 5G in fiscal 2024 and beyond. And then, of course, you got the automotive story layering in and all that drives a lot of goodness in the model. Sure. Yeah. So maybe I'll answer it in two pieces. The first is you're probably asking is, well, what happened? Why? How did you guys do this? And I think if you look back, we've had a commitment to enterprise, okay, from day one, when I became CEO. We never milked the cow. We never took this market for granted. And most of this growth, as you noted, is organic Marvell, right? So this comes from our Ethernet switch team, which really focused on leadership products, latest process node, very strong software capability from our switch business unit and a real focus on the enterprise market, in new products and new product development, product definition. So that had a huge benefit that started three or four years ago and now those designs are ramping. The second is in our Ethernet PHY transceiver business. We've also moved that from being a technology laggard to a technology leader in Ethernet PHY. And we also did an acquisition of Aquantia, which was a relatively small company when we bought it. But when we put the two teams together, the combined share that we've been able to drive has been very significant. And the road map we were able to accelerate dramatically. That's one of our product areas as an example that we're driving to 5-nanometer, okay? And then that has all kinds of integration opportunities. So customers like the road map. They like the team. They like the story. And that's now showing up. And certainly, the enterprise market is not growing at 50% a year. So you have to draw your conclusion. There's been certainly a share shift as customers have adopted our solutions. And we do believe that, this business is going to continue to grow. It will grow next year. It may not grow on the annualized basis at 50%, because you're going to start lapping at some point and we're coming off of a relatively low point from last year. But also remember, our content has gone up on each of these generations as multi-gig Ethernet becomes much more prevalent and especially as enterprises are spending again and implementing WiFi 6, which requires high-speed wired Ethernet connections at multi-gigabit we're seeing switch ports go up on multi-gig, which has our PHY attached to it plus our switches. So there's also a content story here, Toshi. So I wouldn't exactly say, well, enterprise is like a low single-digit grower and eventually, will trend back there. I think between product leadership, share gain and then content increase, enterprise can continue to be a winning business for Marvell."

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue in the third quarter was $1.211 billion, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, growing 13% sequentially and 61% year-over-year. Please note the acquisition of Innovium added approximately $5 million in revenue, which was not contemplated in our original guidance for the third quarter. Revenue growth was robust from all five of our end markets. Data center remained our largest end market, driving 41% of consolidated revenue. Enterprise networking was the next largest with 20% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 18%, consumer at 15% and auto industrial at 6%. GAAP gross margin was 48.5%, which includes the remaining position of Inphi inventory step-up costs. Non-GAAP gross margin was 65.1% of revenue, exceeding the high end of our guidance range primarily due to better than expected end market revenue mix. In particular, revenue from our enterprise networking end market was significantly better than our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $621 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $371 million, which included 25 days of Innovium operating expenses of approximately $5 million. Our GAAP operating loss was $33 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $480 million, or 34.5% of revenue, an all-time record demonstrating the strong leverage in our operating model, while we continue to invest for long-term revenue growth. For the third quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.08. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.43, $0.02 above the high end of our guidance. Earnings per share grew 26% sequentially and 72% year-over-year driven by strong top line revenue momentum and execution on both gross and operating margins. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $265 million. We returned $50 million to shareholders through cash dividends. We paid down $151 million of our long-term debt during the third quarter. As of the end of the third fiscal quarter, our long-term debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was three times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.7 times. Inventory at the end of the third quarter was $629 million. $71 million of this inventory balance is from Innovium, including $42 million in step-up cost due to purchase price accounting. We anticipate amortizing the step-up cost over the next two quarters. We have also increased our work in process inventory to support the revenue growth in revenue we are forecasting. In summary, the Marvell team executed exceptionally well, delivering accelerated top line growth and earnings expansion much faster than revenue growth. Now turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Please note this guidance includes the expected results from the Innovium business for the full quarter. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.32 billion, plus or minus 3%. We expect our GAAP gross margin in the range of 47.9% to 49.8%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 65%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $630 million to $640 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $390 million to $395 million, which include approximately $15 million of OpEx for the acquired Innovium business for the full quarter. This outlook also reflects the increase in investment to support the accelerated revenue growth we are driving across the business, including the launch of multiple new projects tied to the design wins we have discussed in prior quarters. In addition, we're including a higher amount of bonus crew given our strong operating performance well above our plan. As a reminder, looking ahead to the first fiscal quarter of 2023, due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes, our OpEx tends to increase from Q4 of fiscal year by high single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. We expect non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. We expect our basic weighted average share outstanding will be 844 million and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 861 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.03 per share on the lower end to an income of $0.04 per diluted share on the high end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.48, plus or minus $0.03. Now, let me now close with some directional comments on our investment plan for the next fiscal year. As Matt mentioned earlier, we see continued strong demand across our end markets and improvement in supply to drive our top line revenue growth above 30% in fiscal 2023. To support both near-term and long-term revenue growth, we are planning to increase our investment levels appropriately, annualize the midpoint of our OpEx guidance for Q4 for fiscal 2022, which includes both Inphi and Innovium for the full period implies a $1.57 billion baseline OpEx run rate. From this baseline, we are planning for OpEx to grow in the high single digits on a percentage basis in fiscal 2023, substantially lower than our top line revenue growth. We increased our spending to execute on significant design wins and continue to drive process technology leadership as well as aggressive pursue a growing funnel of new design win opportunities within the large $30 billion we discussed at our Investor Day. We are confident we'll continue to drive strong and sustainable long-term revenue growth and deliver earnings expansion much faster than revenue growth in fiscal 2023 and beyond. Operator, please open line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. Yes, I'll start. So if you look at our investment level, as we discussed during the Investor Day, we have a strong leverage because not only our central engineering team really leverage across all the different end markets, we also focused on the cloud optimized silicon solutions and work with the customers. So we do partner with the customers to get the customer funding, too. Overall, if you look at the R&D investment, we have been doing plus the NRE we get from customer actually is significantly larger.  So I would say, our team significantly leveraged the investment across all different advanced process node and also across different end markets. That helps us tremendously. And if you look at the OpEx increase, of course, we acquired both Inphi and Innovium. Year-over-year, it actually is going to get to almost $1.7 billion. That's very much within the target model we are focusing on as our long-term business model. So it's the leverage that helps us tremendously. Yes. Actually, we have improved the supply significantly. However, demand continued to outpace the supply. So we have not made a dent on the delinquency we have as a company. As Matt discussed earlier, if you look at the fiscal 2023, we see strong demand, a significant revenue ramp across all our end markets with our unique product cycles. So 30% -- over 30% year-over-year growth literally. As a matter of fact, if we look into Q1 sequentially, seasonally it will be a down quarter. But for the coming Q1 fiscal 2023, we actually see sequentially revenue increase, approaching mid-single-digit on the basis of a very strong guide for Q4. So the inventory build primarily they are all work in process inventory to support not only Q1 revenue growth and beyond the Q1 for the sequential quarter-over-quarter increase in the next year to support the over 30% top line revenue growth. To just follow what Matt just said, right, next year, we see strong demand across all our end markets. Frankly, it's a supply constraint when we talk about over 30% revenue growth. That's a supply-constrained outlook of what we're looking at. So the normal seasonality definitely does not apply here. We see Q1 sequentially on a very strong Q4 base to increase approaching mid-single digit. And after Q1, we will see continuous sequential increase. Supply dynamics is certainly something our team will continue to drive. But absolutely, if we have more supply, we definitely have more demand. We can ship more products to customers. So you should expect we see sequential increase each quarter for the rest of the next year."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's second quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO. I would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. As discussed during the prior quarters earnings call, we have implemented a change in how we report revenue. Starting with the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we have started to report revenue by a five end markets. In our earnings press release we issued earlier today, we have provided historical end market revenue data by quarter starting with the second quarter of fiscal 2020. In this press release, we have also provided revenue results by product groups. Going forward, we intend to only report revenue by end market. In today's call, Matt will comment briefly on our revenue performance by product group for the second quarter before transitioning most of his discussion to our results and expectations for each of our five end markets. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter GAAP results. Revenue was $1.076 billion, GAAP gross margin was 34.6%, GAAP operating loss was $267 million and loss per diluted share was $0.34. Building on the strong results we delivered in Q1, our second quarter results, which include a full quarter of Inphi, were equally robust driven by strength in our diversified end markets and continued focus on operational excellence. Revenue for the second quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance and grew 29% sequentially and 48% year-over-year. I am now going to review our non-GAAP results for the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.8%, 80 basis points better than expectation. Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than expected and we delivered $331 million in non-GAAP operating income. Revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating income were all record achievements for Marvell. Higher revenue coupled with stronger non-GAAP gross margin and lower OpEx drove non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.34, $0.03 above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP EPS grew 62% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin climbed above 30%, demonstrating significant operating leverage in our business model. In the second quarter, the standalone Marvell business delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth in the high teens on a percentage basis similar to the growth rate we saw in Q1. I am also pleased with the strength of our Inphi business, which delivered revenue above expectations and was accretive to our non-GAAP earnings in its first full quarter within Marvell. On a product group basis, networking revenue was $702 million, above the midpoint of expectations and grew 41% sequentially and 73% year-over-year. Storage revenue was $342 million also above the midpoint of expectations and grew 13% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Our storage business, which I would note does not include any contributions from Inphi is now running at an annualized revenue run rate of approximately $1.4 billion. This business has been growing double digits year-over-year in recent quarters, reflecting its remarkable transformation from significant PC exposure to now being focused largely on the data center. Based on the significant improvement in the mix of end markets combined with design wins we have secured for SSD controllers, HDD controllers and preamps, we expect our storage business to continue to grow strongly over the next several years. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets. I'll start with a recap of the substantial improvements we have driven over the last few years in focusing the company on data infrastructure, which is evident in the historical data we have provided today. As a result of our strategic multi-year transformation, we have significantly increased our exposure to the data center and carrier end markets, which are characterized by long product life cycles, sticky design wins and multi-generational engagements. At the same time, we have substantially reduced our dependence on the consumer market, which tends to be more volatile with shorter product life cycles. The consumer market is now only 15% of our total revenue. Factors contributing to this change include significantly higher growth we have driven from the other end markets, our de-emphasis on PC, HDD and SSD controllers and the sale of our Wi-Fi business. In sharp contrast, data center is now our largest end market and at 40% of total revenue is about twice as large as any of our other end markets. We believe that data center is positioned to become an even bigger part of Marvell over time, when we combine our growing market share with the numerous secular growth drivers in this end market. Over the last few years, data center has become our most diversified end market with revenue contribution from nearly every Marvell product line. Cloud is the primary growth driver in this end market, and it's exciting to note that cloud now represents more than half of our data center revenue, making cloud on its own larger than any of our other four end markets. We have grown our data center business through organic investment in our nearline HDD controllers and preamps, SSD controllers as well as significant M&A. We added Cavium\u2019s LiquidIO and LiquidSecurity DPUs, which have been adopted by multiple cloud customers. The Avera acquisition added a custom ASIC platform, which we coupled with Marvell\u2019s leading standard product IP. This has proven to be extremely compelling to hyperscale customers who are building custom hardware to deploy incredibly efficient and optimized infrastructure. We recently added Inphi\u2019s market-leading electro-optics portfolio for high-speed connectivity both within and between cloud data centers. Finally, the proposed acquisition of Innovium will add their cloud optimized Ethernet switches to our data center portfolio of products. With the broadest technology platform in the industry, we believe Marvell is well positioned to become a semiconductor leader in data center and expect this end market will be the most important growth opportunity for the company over the next several years. In carrier infrastructure, we have been significantly growing our dollar content base station, winning new customers and growing our overall market share in the 5G market. Just over the last two years, our carrier revenue has nearly tripled, representing approximately 20% of our total revenue. We expect a sustained period of strong revenue growth from this end market driven by an increase in 5G deployments, which are still on the early stage of worldwide adoption and the ramp of our full platform of 5G products and multiple customers in their current generation of base station. We have also won additional sockets in five-nanometer, which will go into production in next generation base station launches over the next several years, extending the growth from our carrier end market over a long time period. The enterprise networking end market comprises approximately 20% of our total revenue. The revenue contribution from this end market has grown rapidly and kept pace with the strong growth in Marvell\u2019s total revenue over the last few years. This is a solid accomplishment against the backdrop of challenging end market dynamics. In fact, over the last two years, our enterprise revenue has grown at 23% annual CAGR with the majority of the growth coming from standalone Marvell Ethernet switch Inphi products. These refreshed platforms have been instrumental in driving outsized revenue growth, a testament to the competitiveness of our products and technology. We believe that we are well positioned to continue outperforming the market and are looking forward to a recovery in enterprise spending that would serve as an incremental tailwind to this business. Our revenue from the automotive and industrial end market has begun to accelerate recent quarters benefiting from the ramp in our auto Ethernet connectivity business. Our automotive business is in its early stages of growth, given our design win traction and the growth expected in the adoption of Ethernet technology in cars, we expect the revenue contribution from this end market will become a larger portion of our total revenue over time. Let me now move on to discussing our second quarter results and third quarter expectations for each of our end markets starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the second quarter was $434 million, growing 57% sequentially and 62% year-over-year. Strong growth was driven by contributions from the acquired Inphi business and ongoing growth from the standalone Marvell business. Cloud customers drove the vast majority of the growth in our data center end market. Our electro-optics products continue to benefit from the adoption of PAM-based connectivity inside cloud data centers as well as the adoption of DCI or data center interconnect between regional locations. Marvell's DPUs and storage products also contributed to growth in this end market. Last quarter, we discussed a number of significant design wins, leveraging our advanced technology platform with multiple cloud customers across a variety of applications and business models. These are expected to drive a substantial step-up in our cloud revenue in the calendar 2024 to 2025 timeframe. Development is in full swing on these projects and I am pleased to report that our cloud design win momentum continues this quarter with an additional custom ASIC design secured for a cloud networking application. We expect to continue to win sockets and gain share in this market, leveraging the strength of our portfolio and growing engagements with key cloud customers. In our third fiscal quarter, we are expecting another strong performance from data center, projecting robust sequential revenue growth in the double-digits on a percentage basis. We expect year-over-year growth will be considerably higher and project data center revenue to just over double from a year-ago. We expect a sequential growth to be driven by cloud with virtually all of our product lines contributing to growth. I am also pleased to note that in the third quarter, we expect to start ramping our second-generation of COLORZ DCI products, 400-gig ZR into volume production. With our proposed acquisition of Innovium, we are looking forward to adding their cloud-optimized switches to Marvell's broad data center portfolio. We received very positive feedback from multiple key customers following our announcement of the planned combination. They are excited about the prospect of collaborating more closely with us once the acquisition closes to address their need for high performance switches going forward. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $197 million, growing 17% sequentially and 38% year-over-year. In addition to the contribution from Inphi, year-on-year growth was enabled by a standalone Marvell's wireless business. Our wireless revenue growth was driven by ongoing deployments of 5G as well as product ramps at Samsung and Nokia, partially offset by an expected decline in custom ASICs shipping into China. Design win progress continues in 5G, and I am pleased to report that we have won a next-generation ASIC design leveraging our five-nanometer technology platform within the radio unit at a key base station customer. With this win, we have now secured five-nanometer design at three Tier 1 base station customers. Our O-RAN and vRAN platform, which includes our card-based layer-1 accelerator, also continues to be adopted by multiple cloud customers and wireless base station OEMs. In the third fiscal quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth from the carrier end market, driven by strong growth from wireless, partially offset by a decline from wired. We project the strong growth in wireless in the double-digit sequentially and on a percentage basis to come from an increase in 5G deployments in multiple regions. In addition, we expect growth from 5G to significantly accelerate in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis for our carrier end market, we project strong revenue growth to continue above 20% in the third quarter. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $223 million, growing 27% sequentially and 41% year-over-year with the majority of the growth coming from standalone Marvell products. This remarkable level of organic growth in the enterprise end market was made possible in part by a strong effort from our operations team to address pent-up customer demand. While we expect strong demand to continue for the foreseeable future, we expect supply constraints will impact our ability to sustain this level of revenue attainment in the third quarter. From a product perspective, growth in the second quarter was driven by our Ethernet networking portfolio, benefiting from ongoing share gains in the beginning of multi-gig adoption. We are also encouraged by strong demand for our products from customers that we believe indicator recovery is underway in this end market. Looking ahead to the third quarter, while we expect a sequential decline in revenue due to supply constraints, we anticipate strong year-over-year growth approaching 30%. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $57 million, growing 24% sequentially and 125% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing ramps in our auto business. Marvell continues to gain recognition from customers for its commitment to automotive grade quality and reliability. During the quarter, we received a prestigious Global Supplier Award from the Bosch Group in recognition of Marvell's outstanding performance and quality in the manufacture and supply of leading-edge data infrastructure semiconductors. We are looking forward to our continued partnership and long-term collaboration with Bosch on our broad and growing group of automotive customers and partners. Turning to the third fiscal quarter. We expect our revenue from the auto and industrial end market to grow sequentially. Year-over-year, we project growth will continue to be very strong and expect revenue to nearly double in the third quarter. We also expect to attain an important milestone in the third quarter. Our automotive business is projected to cross over a $100 million annualized revenue run rate earlier the prior expectation. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $165 million, declining 1% sequentially and growing 23% year-over-year. Most of the revenue in this end market is from standalone Marvell and the strong annual growth is driven primarily by our custom DIY SSD controllers. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially while year-over-year revenue growth will remain strong in the double-digits on a percentage basis. In closing, we expect our business momentum to gather strength in the second half of fiscal year 2022. Our recent results and near-term expectations for revenue growth continue to trend above the high-end of our target model. Demand for our products continues to significantly outpace supply and our global operations team is aggressively securing more capacity. We are working closely with our supply partners, leveraging our scale and balance sheet to improve our ability to win strong, secular growth and demand we expect for our data infrastructure products, both in the short and the long-term. For our third fiscal quarter at the midpoint of guidance, we expect revenue to grow 6% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. We expect growth from the standalone Marvell business to accelerate to over 20% year-over-year in the third quarter compared to the high-teens we achieved in the first half. Additionally, we expect the Inphi business to continue to perform well and grow faster than standalone Marvell. Our integration of Inphi is proceeding very well and we successfully achieved our one ERP milestone ahead of schedule. Leveraging the larger scale and broader set of key technologies, the combined teams are working closely together on winning new opportunities at multiple Tier 1 customers. We are also looking forward to completing the proposed acquisition of Innovium, which will broaden our Ethernet switch platform and further increase our exposure to the fast-growing cloud data center market. I am also pleased to announce that we will be hosting our Investor Day this year on Wednesday, October 6, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. Pacific. Similar to last year, this will be a virtual event webcasted live on our website. We will provide more event details in a press release shortly. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nJean Hu: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue in the second quarter was $1.076 billion, $11 million above the midpoint of guidance. Networking represented 65% of our revenue with storage contributing 32%. Revenue from other accounted for 3% of our revenue. As Ashish mentioned earlier, starting with the third quarter, we will only report revenue by our five end market to provide a more transparency about the key growth drivers of our business. GAAP gross margin was 34.6%, which included the amortization of Inphi inventory step-up cost. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.8% of revenue, 80 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to a better mix. GAAP operating expenses were $638 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $366 million, approximately $6 million below the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to faster-than-expected Inphi synergy achievement and disciplined OpEx management. I am confident that our team will achieve the remaining Inphi integration synergies based on the plan we discussed last quarter. Given the significant growth opportunities ahead of us, we are turning our focus to ensuring continued investment to support our long-term profitable growth. As a reminder, our operating expenses can vary quarter-to-quarter affected by factors such as the number of tape-outs within a particular quarter, and these tape-outs are becoming more expensive in newer process geometry. The cadence of NRE payment which we treat as the contra OpEx can also add variability. Our GAAP operating loss was $267 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $331 million or 38.8% of revenue. For the second quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.34. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.34. Now turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $222 million. We returned $49 million to shareholders through dividend payment. Our long-term debt was $4.7 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.4x and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3x. Inventory at the end of second quarter was $460 million. We amortized $156 million of the Inphi inventory step-up cost in the second quarter due to purchase price accounting and we anticipate amortizing the remaining balance of $17 million by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Now turning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Please note this guidance does not include any contributions from the pending acquisition of Innovium. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.145 billion plus or minus 3%. We expect our GAAP gross margin in the range of 46.3% to 48.3%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 64% to 65%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $584 million to $594 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $365 million to $370 million. We expect non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 824 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 841 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP loss per share in the range of $0.10, plus or minus $0.04. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.38, plus or minus $0.03. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, Matt, Jean. Thanks for letting me ask question and congratulations on the solid results. Matt, relative to your enterprise commentary, you talked about supply constraints impacting the October quarter. I'm wondering when you look at the overall business holistically, where are things relative to the supply side of the equation? Are you still unable to ship to full demand by sort of what amount? And earlier this week, there were some rumors in the popular press of the foundry guys raising pricing. I'm just kind of curious if you guys have embedded that into your gross margin guidance and how you're thinking about kind of the current inflationary pricing environment. Can you pass that on? Or is that something that you can't pass on?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Great. Thanks, John. So with respect to enterprise, let me just frame it at the whole company level. We are still carrying pretty meaningful levels of delinquency across all of the end markets as our business has accelerated in terms of topline growth, which we've been very pleased at. I guess the downside is that the demand has continued to grow. Well, I guess it's a good thing. The demand is growing faster than supply, but we need to catch up. So enterprise is impacted, but so are the other end markets. Although I would say given the complex nature of our networking products, we're carrying relatively more \u2013 we're relatively farther behind there. We were pleased that we\u2019re able to have a strong performance in Q2 and catch up because as you can see, there was a fairly meaningful step-up in revenue. Most of that is coming from organic standalone Marvell. There is some contribution from Inphi, but it's not as \u2013 it wasn't large for Inphi. So this is all Marvell, and in fact when you look into Q3, in our guidance that still implies a 30% year-over-year growth rate in enterprise. So we could ship a lot more if we could get the products, and I think you could also view this as another sign that the enterprise business, which we had been saying a quarter or two ago could be a real tailwind for the company. This business is definitely picking up both at the end market and demand level as well as our own design wins layering in. So we're going to be working hard to increase our revenues here and catch up on the delinquency. On the foundry side, and just in general with the pricing environment, I mean, as you recall, there was a lot of commentary at the end of last year and early this year from all the major semiconductor companies relative to the supply chain cost increases that have been occurring on an ongoing basis. And that's everything from foundry to backend to substrates. We said earlier this year, we\u2019re able to work with our customers on that. And so as you can see in our margin performance, we've been able to work with them to pass that on. We've done that pretty fairly and in a neutral manner. I anticipate as we head into calendar 2022 that there will be additional increases across the industry and input costs. And I'm confident, as part of Marvell, we're able to work with our customers to again neutralize that impact. But the key focus we have right now, John, is planning our business together, focusing on long-term supply and making sure that not only can we meet the short-term, but also engage in multiple long-term agreements where we really have a much stronger visibility to long-term supply. So that's been the priority for us. That's been the priority for our customers. And I think the pricing has been second at this point.\nJohn Pitzer: Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question and echo that congrats on the results. Matt, I want to go a little bit into the carrier business. You talked in your press release about the 5G business accelerating in the third quarter. And then taking this, I think you've called it a significant step-up again in the fourth quarter. Can you give us just a little bit of a ballpark, how much of your carrier business is that? What's driving that 5G step-up? And I guess this is kind of the deductive logic, what's driving the step-down on the wired side implicit in your fiscal third quarter guide?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Great. Thanks, Ross. Yes. So wireless has performed very well for us. Historically, as you recall, we had seven straight quarters of sequential growth in our 5G business. That took a pause this past quarter, which we had signaled with the China 5G digestion. And then on the positive side, we see that business reaccelerating and growing in Q3 and then even more in Q4. That's primarily on the back of new design wins that we had achieved several years ago, ramping into production. And those geographies that are being serviced through those are primarily non-China. So that's really part of the \u2013 now the global rollout, which we're well positioned with our key customers there. So it's a combination of global rollout plus new content kicking in which we had been signaling for some time. So that's all going well. The balance as you mentioned is wired. That business historically wasn't terribly large for Marvell. We picked up some wired revenue from Inphi really in the coherent franchise, which does link in some ways to the growth of global data traffic. So we feel good going forward about the wired portion, that's the Inphi piece. But in general, that business is lumpier. That business also has pretty significant supply constraints around it as well. And so I'd say the traditional Marvell wired business isn't necessarily a growth business. The carrier business over time will be driven by the wireless portion as well as some of the Inphi business. And just big round numbers, the wireless portion is roughly half the carrier number, and that will grow over time, obviously as wired probably stays flattish without Inphi. Inphi will grow, and then obviously the 5G rollouts will really be what's going to drive the carrier growth over the next few years.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Matt, you're guiding Q3 sales up by, I think, $69 million, $70 million, 6% or so. Is that really the absolute dollars of supply equivalent that is becoming available? And if that is the case, is that the range of supply dollars that could be available for the next several quarters? So I know you're not guiding more than a quarter out. I'm just trying to get a better sense for how many supply dollars are kind of becoming available for the next handful of quarters because it seems like that is really what's going to get what we assume from a growth perspective for you over the next several quarters. And I think part B of that on the 5G side, you alluded to that 5G ramp in Q4. Would that be incremental to that kind of supply available? Or do you think that is kind of captured in those dollars? So just trying to get a better sense for what the flexes on the supply side over the next handful of quarters. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes. I mean, I think it's fairly straightforward in terms of how we think about the guidance and just the broader commentary that we gave, which very much comprehends the supply that we see available, and we're obviously been pushing hard to increase that. And I would note, we have increased that. If you look even going back to a year-ago or more even at the beginning of calendar 2020, we started growing the company double digits and that growth rate for the standalone Marvell has actually accelerated, right. It was in the double-digit range. Now you get to the first half of this year, we had 17% kind of growth, both in Q1 and Q2 in the standalone Marvell business. We've said that that's going to pick up in Q3, right, more like 20% year-over-year. And we expect that we can continue going at that kind of rate. So we've been actually accelerating our ability to get supply. And then on top of that, we've got Inphi kicking in, which has also been able to grow their business meaningfully. So we've been signaling for quite some time to our supply chain that \u2013 and our suppliers that we have needs and here they are. And so you should expect that we're going to keep working on that and we're going to keep driving the supply higher as available. We've had I think a lot of productive discussions and negotiations with our key suppliers, not only for this quarter, next quarter, but next year and even beyond in terms of really lining up where we see our business heading. The advantage I think we have over some of the other industry peers perhaps is that our product life cycles, Vivek, in data infrastructure are very long. These are typically five, sometimes seven-year life cycles. So we've got very good visibility. And so we're in those discussions right now, both this quarter, next quarter blocking and tackling as well as planning our calendar 2022, and then even planning out even farther with some long-term agreements we're putting in place. But just to circle back to the main question, yes, everything we give you is centered around what we can actually supply. There\u2019s \u2013 like I said, every one of our end markets, we could ship more right now if we could get the parts.\nVivek Arya: Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey. Good afternoon, and thanks for the question and thanks for the additional segment guidance. Just curious on, you mentioned another cloud ASIC win and that can span a lot storage or DPUs, CPUs networking, and now maybe optical. So I was wondering if you could give any color on that one, or maybe just in general, all these wins that you've had, where you're seeing the most traction across ASIC capabilities to be helpful.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Sure, Blayne. Thanks. Yes, I'd say just, if I frame it more broadly as you mentioned the dynamic is that the ASIC and semi-custom wins that we're getting are across a broad range of applications. So it's all the above. They're everything from compute, ML, AI, networking, storage, and I'm pleased with the breadth and it's across multiple customers, multiple applications. I believe in my prepared remarks on the one that we just secured was actually in the networking area. So it's in a bunch of different applications. But it's all leveraging fundamentally, Blayne, the five-nanometer technology platform that we introduced in the summer of 2020, which is leveraging all of the high performance standard Marvell IPs. That's all going very well. And just as a side note on our five-nanometer programs are with multiple products now that have taped out this year. We actually have the first Silicon on five-nanometer coming back now imminently. And we're very happy with all the benchmarking performance et cetera. I'd also say that we're in a strong period of design win momentum, primarily because we introduced the platform in 2020, there's a whole range now of RFQs that we've been successful on closing on. And that's not just in the cloud, by the way, we also noted we won an important 5G ASIC just recently. And even across some of our other end markets, we've also secured some very important programs on five-nanometer. So yes, so I think over time, what you'll see is a very diverse offering of cloud, set of custom and semi-custom sockets across multiple end markets and multiple applications.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. And congrats on the record results. Matt, you mentioned that 400ZR is going to be ramping now. Is that which sort of Inphi\u2019s anchored customer? Or are you starting to see ramps with multiple hyperscalers for that particular product? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. What I\u2019d say, Tore, is on 400ZR unlike the initial COLORZ product, which was primarily at one hyperscaler. The engagements are much more broad with 400ZR. And so I'd say there are a number of different design opportunities and wins that are at various stages of trials, qualifications and production ramps. But we anticipate that 400ZR will be multi-customer, multi-year and a very important product cycle for Marvell. But there is one primary customer ramping now, but it's going to continue beyond that.\nTore Svanberg: Understood. Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. As I look beyond Q3 and the growing demand profile for your products, right, combined with strong product upgrade cycles, you've got 400-gig in your PAM for optical business. As you just mentioned, you are ramping new data center interconnect business on 400ZR, 5G wireless you mentioned, and continued strong demand for your nearline HDD and enterprise SSD controllers. This would suggest that a high level sequential growth into Q4. Does the team have the supply commitments, both wafers and packaging substrates to drive quarter-on-quarter growth in Q4 if the backlog supports it?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks for the question Harlan. We do, we see increase in supply each quarter. Our backlog today and firm purchase orders firmly supports that plus the supply that comes with it. So we do expect sequential growth in Q4. And as you mentioned \u2013 you outlined a number of growth opportunities. This isn't just going to be a Q3, Q4 type of phenomena. Each one of these really carries into our calendar 2022 and in many cases accelerates. So that's why I said earlier in one of the prior questions, there's blocking and tackling in Q3 and Q4, but we've been really working for the last six months in detail, even longer on how do we line up continued strong growth in calendar 2022, 2023, 2024 because this is going to be multi-year and many of these engagements by the way are also multi-generational. So we tend to transition from one platform to another, and we're going to see that in our 5G business as an example. So yes, bottom line is we do have supply lined up and we're going to keep working hard to make sure we can chunk away that delinquency. And we're very focused on customer set at this point. I think that's the main driving force of what we do right now, Harlan, is just make sure that we're not the long pole in the tent that we're meeting what our customers need, and that we're also planning our business together, and I'm quite pleased with how that cooperation is going. And I think we have a very, very clear outlook for what we need to go get done in the next few quarters and through next year.\nHarlan Sur: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko Securities. Please go ahead.\nSrinivas Pajjuri: Thank you. Matt, I have a question on the hyperscale business. Obviously, you have several product cycles in the 400-gig, 400ZR, and you also mentioned DPUs. What I'm trying to figure out is that, many of your peers are also reporting very strong demand from hyperscale. So trying to understand to what extent your business is mostly structural versus also benefiting from some of the spending increase and the cyclical factors. So as we go through the next few quarters, as I guess, some of the cyclical factors slow down. Just trying to figure out, how we should think about your core business that goes into the hyperscale customers?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. I think Srini it's both. So clearly the peer companies are \u2013 I mean, there's probably one notable exception. But in general, the peer companies are reporting very strong growth in hyperscale. So I think that is secular. And I think that's very much happening. If you just look at our organic growth and you can do the math because you know sort of where Inphi was a year-ago, it's very, very strong. And in fact, as I look to Q3, it's both growth from Inphi, but as you pointed out and it's not just DPUs from Marvell, it's also our networking products with our storage products. I mean, we sell a number of product lines, let's call it 10, maybe 10 plus product lines just going into cloud alone. Almost each one of those is up even sequentially in Q3, almost all of them are up. And then if you look at year-over-year, the growth in our data center business actually \u2013 and cloud business from Marvell standalone would actually be even growing faster than the Inphi business. And that's all on the basis of new designs and new ramps contributing to that. So I think we've got growth, we've got strong secular demand happening in the hyperscale, but it's our own unique cycles. As you mentioned, the transition from NRZ to PAM and 400-gig and 200-gig intra-data center, the ramp now of 400ZR, the attach rate of DPUs, attaching more and more as a percentage to CPU's, and then you've got our own product cycles, whether they're new design wins and DIY storage for flash. I mean, I could go through the whole list, but it's \u2013 I think that's the exciting thing about our portfolio. That's very differentiated in the semiconductor industry relative to the hyperscale accounts. We have so many product lines, very unique and very differentiated both in the Silicon and the software and firmware we provide. And we're just at the early stages in some of these quite frankly, in terms of the ramp cycle. So when you look at the guide, we're going to be \u2013 obviously our guide for data center is about 2x the rate of growth for the whole company just from Q2 to Q3. And certainly we have very strong expectations heading into next year on the data center.\nSrinivas Pajjuri: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you very much Matt and Jean. On gross margin, despite all the input costs, you have been able to keep it to the higher end of long-term. And Matt, you made a comment about next year kind of expecting additional input, not additional \u2013 ongoing input cost increase. So should we expect gross margin to kind of stay in the higher end of the range like you're guiding to? Or is there an offset? And I do realize that there's a product mix impact as well. So just please helps us understand how we should think about the overall gross margin?\nJean Hu: Hey, Ambrish. This is Jean. Yes, firstly we're very pleased with our strong Q2 gross margin performance. And I think a lot of the things we discussed in the past is the primary driver of our gross margin is really a product mix. And what we have been doing with the customers as Matt mentioned is that we're working with the customers, really try to minimize the impact from all the input cost increase. But overall, if you think about the product portfolio we have in data center, as Matt just mentioned earlier and also enterprise in Q2, we see our enterprise business, networking business growing 27% sequentially. All those significant performance on the product portfolio on the revenue side actually are very favorable to our gross margin. Fundamentally it's a reflection of our investment in the IP. So I don't think that will change because we continue to innovate, we continue to invest to drive the portfolio and the topline revenue growth. So we're going to be in the range and we'll continue to work with the customers to set priorities and to make sure we meet the customer's need first and then definitely we want to make sure our operating model continue to leverage to expand the operating profit going forward.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Got it, Jean. So we should assume at the higher end of the long-term rate then, right, given how the product mix is shifting more towards\u2026\nJean Hu: The range is the product mix because we have a five end market. Quarter-over-quarter, you're going to see the variability of the mix change. Frankly, what we discussed the 64% to 65% that range is potentially you are going to see in the long-term.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Got it. Thank you, Jean.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoseph Moore: Great. Thank you. We appreciate the additional revenue classifications and the color there. I'm curious how you're thinking about building the development team? Are you going to focus on these end markets more? Or I noticed there storage controllers, I think going into four of the five segments. So are you going to maintain vertical market focus on storage? And then have kind of a go-to-market and just how should we think about this impact not just where we see your business but how you're seeing internally?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks for the question, Joe. Actually it\u2019s pretty insightful. So we're a product company, we're a technology company. We're organized by business units, we have divisions, business units and product lines, and each of those is really responsible for driving technical excellence in everything they do, product differentiation roadmap. And that's going to continue. What I would say though, is when I look at my level and when we look at, what I \u2013 and this has been consistent for five years. I had a philosophy when I became CEO, which was that the semiconductor companies that adopted a market based approach relative to looking at the R&D investment profile across its portfolio. Those companies that made that shift we\u2019re going to have the biggest level going forward. I mean, I'm just, I appreciate it internally all the time, which is the market always wins. And so we had an era when I started in the industry, which was, you just did parts as many parts as you can put them out in the data book, so you buy the parts, best part wins. There was a shift to, hey, go focus on customers, find a customer, sell a basket of products. But in the end, it's really the end market orientation and concentration which ultimately drives your business and those that the shifting that mix is like one of the hardest things to do in business, okay. You can sort of shift your product line, you can move some investment around, but to get it to flow through to the P&L is really tough. And so I think one of the things, when you just take a 30,000 foot view, Joe, of what we've accomplished in the last five years, you know, consumer, when I joined was probably 70% to 80% of the revenue, right. It's 15. I think the total contribution from cloud and 5G and auto was if it was $75 million bucks a year, we'd be lucky, okay. It's like doing, it's in the billions range today. So that's really where I've been taking the firm over the last five years through the M&A, through all the investments through the R&D changes we've made. So that we can achieve, an end market mix that really meets our long-term strategy. And we're not there yet, you know, we're, I think we're pleased; we've sort of unveiled this thing. We're 40% in data center, we're 20% in carrier, we're 20% in enterprise. We've got this automotive thing that's growing really fast. So that concentration now and where we want to be is very high, but the key focus areas like cloud, 5G and auto, those are going to continue to increase as a percentage of our total. So maybe a longer answer, Joe, we organized by business unit, but we run the company and ultimately the capital allocation framework, ultimately around the end market and even where the R&D going. And it's a very rigorous process we have internally, and you can see the results over the last five years of what we've been able to accomplish with that framework.\nJoseph Moore: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nToshiya Hari: Thanks for taking. Hello?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. We are here.\nToshiya Hari: Sorry. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the solid results. Matt, I realize it's still a relatively small portion of your business but you talked about your automotive business exceeding a $100 million in annualized run rate in Q3. I was hoping you could speak to the breadth of that business today in terms of product, technology, customer mix. And I guess more importantly, based on the design win pipeline, you have in front of you today. How are you thinking about the growth rate going forward in that business? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. So the business today is, has been squarely focused in this pretty radical change that happened over the last few years with the internal networks of the car, moving to Ethernet based products and packet based networking. And that's for a number of reasons. The design wins we have today are extremely broad. And, we've got something like 24%, 20% to 24% car OEMs, not models, not individual products, but the actual OEMs themselves who are adopting Marvell Ethernet technology. In many cases, they've elected to go sole source with us and those engagements primarily to ensure interoperability because as you add more and more easy to use and modules inside the car that you want to hook up your Ethernet, you actually want to make sure that the link is highly reliable. We have wins both with the established leading Tier 1, call it top 10 car OEMs, but also a very strong position in the emerging challengers. All the EV startups, which when you add it all up, and of course, Tesla is a big part of the number, but there's like $700 billion, $800 billion worth of market cap tied up and do emerging EV entrance. So we've got sort of the new guys that are designing our stuff in, that's a call option on growth and then we have the established players as well. Relative to the financial \u2013 the potential, now we've said that we believe it's going to be about a $1 billion market over the next few years. And at our Analyst Day, we gave line of sight to this being a multi-hundred million dollar type of business. The business has accelerated. We had signaled last year that we were hoping to get to $25 million a quarter. Exiting the year, we guided now that we're going get there in Q3 and this business has got tremendous momentum, and you can look at the data we provided now to see how far that business has come over the last seven, eight quarters. Most of that growth that you see has been driven by the automotive contribution. So it's a big opportunity. And I think that that ultimately that $1 billion market, you go out 10 years, it'll be probably $2 billion, and we obviously hope we can get a big share of that. So it's a big opportunity. And I think the last point I would make is that it's really an entry now because it's such a key part of the car architecture that we're very, very focused now on applications outside of Ethernet. So compute applications, additional networking products, security and storage and we've really proven ourselves. Final point, we've shipped millions and millions of units now into cars that are on the road. We're running at \u2013 an astonishing one DPPM type of quality rate, or actually less. In fact, the most recent update I got is we were in the 800, 900 PPB, which I can tell you having a lot of experience in the automotive market, it's really hard to get under one. And the products have been engineered extremely well. We put in place like a world-class automotive flow. So we can leverage that, Toshi, for many other Marvell technologies and products outside of Ethernet. And you should expect to hear more from us on this in the future.\nToshiya Hari: Great. Thank you for the details.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nGary Mobley: Hi. I have a couple of questions for Jean. Jean, I would assume that you're in sort of the sweet spot of the OpEx synergy realization from the Inphi acquisition. You're guiding for roughly $1 million sequential growth in non-GAAP OpEx for the third quarter. And so just given all the different moving pieces in your investments and the synergies to be realized in Inphi, is it realistic to think that you could see fourth quarter OpEx drop sequentially, and then eventually, tick back up in the first quarter per year usual first year increases? And then for the non-GAAP tax rate, if I'm not mistaken, your expectation is for it to increase going forward. Should we think about that maybe 100 basis point to 200 basis point annual increases going forward? Thank you.\nJean Hu: Maybe the easy one first. On the non-GAAP tax rate for next year, you'll probably can just model about 6% because we do have a lot of the tax deductions as part of our merger with Inphi. So that's the assumption you can model. On the OpEx rate, our team did a great job to integrate the one ERP one quarter ahead of the time. So if you look at the synergy achievement we outlined last quarter, we basically achieved the one ERP one quarter earlier, so the OpEx came off in Q2 and then Q3 guidance, frankly, as I said earlier, we do see the pattern of synergy achievement just exactly the same as we outlined last quarter. So Q4, typically, there are variabilities of OpEx. I think, I will leave it to you to model it, but from our perspective, we are quite confident to achieve the Inphi synergy, at the same time the seasonality of OpEx in Q1, you're absolutely right, typically Q1 because of the payroll tax, the OpEx will step up. I just want to make sure, right, the team at Marvell is very thoughtful in managing OpEx, but at the same time increase the investment to drive the long-term revenue growth. Especially given the tremendous opportunities we have ahead of us, we are going to make sure we invest, but at the same time, we always going to drive revenue growth significantly higher than the OpEx growth.\nGary Mobley: Thanks, Jean.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nChris Caso: Yes. Thank you. Good evening. The question is just a clarification of what\u2019s included in the new segmentation specifically for data center. And I think your comments that half of \u2013 more than half of that business was cloud-based. What's the other half? Is that more in the area of campus networking? If you can clarify that. And maybe you could talk to the relative growth rates of cloud versus the non-cloud that you're expecting within the Data Center segment going forward?\nJean Hu: Maybe I'll \u2013 I'll give you the definition then Matt can add. On the on-premise data center, that\u2019s part of the data center is really, frankly, it's our \u2013 some of the HDD business, Fiber Channel business and the Networking business it's on-premise data center, but more than half its actually cloud data center. Matt, you can add more.\nMatt Murphy: Yes, sure. So think of this as our traditional industry standard servers, host bus adapter cards, enterprise mix, things like that. So that business historically has been pretty flat. And just to clarify the campus networking products, that's an enterprise networking, so that's moves to the enterprise line. So we've gone through pretty carefully and just figured out which \u2013 what our revenue concentration is specifically in the enterprise on-prem side. So that we assume it's going to be a flattish business. It's been a flattish business. It'll have its ups and downs here and there. All the growth is going to come from cloud. And so as we mentioned, it's over half of the revenue today, and even if you look to Q3, the acceleration and growth you see is coming from that portion. And we expect the cloud to be probably one of the biggest growth drivers of the whole company over the next few years. I mean, cloud alone is larger than carrier, larger than enterprise, larger than consumer, larger than anything else, just on its own \u2013 as its own line item, and that should continue to see very outsized growth for the foreseeable the future.\nChris Caso: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question will come from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nQuinn Bolton: Sorry, can you hear me now?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. There you go.\nQuinn Bolton: Okay. Sorry about that. Matt, I was just going to ask on the 400ZR ramp. How much of that business for Marvell will be optical modules, complete modules versus just selling DSPs to other module vendors? And the reason I ask is if you look at your market share sort of by DSP, what share do you think you may ultimately achieve in the ZR market if you're just counting DSPs?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. You're asking some great questions. Let me give you maybe a higher level view and then we've got \u2013 as we mentioned, our Analyst Day coming up in October, where you're going to be able to hear actually from the various executives running these groups, and they'll talk in a lot more detail about sort of the questions you're asking because that's fairly specific, but at the highest level 400ZR is going to be a combination, okay, of both modules as well as standalone DSPs. The team has lined up with number of partners, both for the ZR applications, ZR plus there's an open version of that, and then there's also applications for this that are not DCI, right, that are actually in the carrier market. And so there's a broad opportunity here Quinn, besides just, \u201cHey, we take the one hyperscaler we had, we are moving to 400ZR and then it's done.\u201d It's not that at all. And the initial ramp we are seeing is based on modules and we're continuing to be committed to that. That's a good business for us. But the Inphi team, I think, had done a great job of lining up a broader ecosystem set of partners to drive DSP sales as well. So we'll give more color on those dynamics, when we get into the Investor Day and we start talking more about our products and our technologies.\nQuinn Bolton: Great. Thank you, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. You're welcome.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Murphy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our second quarter GAAP results. Revenue was $1.076 billion, GAAP gross margin was 34.6%, GAAP operating loss was $267 million and loss per diluted share was $0.34. Building on the strong results we delivered in Q1, our second quarter results, which include a full quarter of Inphi, were equally robust driven by strength in our diversified end markets and continued focus on operational excellence. Revenue for the second quarter exceeded the midpoint of our guidance and grew 29% sequentially and 48% year-over-year. I am now going to review our non-GAAP results for the quarter. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.8%, 80 basis points better than expectation. Non-GAAP operating expenses were lower than expected and we delivered $331 million in non-GAAP operating income. Revenue, non-GAAP gross margin and non-GAAP operating income were all record achievements for Marvell. Higher revenue coupled with stronger non-GAAP gross margin and lower OpEx drove non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.34, $0.03 above the midpoint of guidance. Non-GAAP EPS grew 62% year-over-year. Our non-GAAP operating margin climbed above 30%, demonstrating significant operating leverage in our business model. In the second quarter, the standalone Marvell business delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth in the high teens on a percentage basis similar to the growth rate we saw in Q1. I am also pleased with the strength of our Inphi business, which delivered revenue above expectations and was accretive to our non-GAAP earnings in its first full quarter within Marvell. On a product group basis, networking revenue was $702 million, above the midpoint of expectations and grew 41% sequentially and 73% year-over-year. Storage revenue was $342 million also above the midpoint of expectations and grew 13% sequentially and 18% year-over-year. Our storage business, which I would note does not include any contributions from Inphi is now running at an annualized revenue run rate of approximately $1.4 billion. This business has been growing double digits year-over-year in recent quarters, reflecting its remarkable transformation from significant PC exposure to now being focused largely on the data center. Based on the significant improvement in the mix of end markets combined with design wins we have secured for SSD controllers, HDD controllers and preamps, we expect our storage business to continue to grow strongly over the next several years. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets. I'll start with a recap of the substantial improvements we have driven over the last few years in focusing the company on data infrastructure, which is evident in the historical data we have provided today. As a result of our strategic multi-year transformation, we have significantly increased our exposure to the data center and carrier end markets, which are characterized by long product life cycles, sticky design wins and multi-generational engagements. At the same time, we have substantially reduced our dependence on the consumer market, which tends to be more volatile with shorter product life cycles. The consumer market is now only 15% of our total revenue. Factors contributing to this change include significantly higher growth we have driven from the other end markets, our de-emphasis on PC, HDD and SSD controllers and the sale of our Wi-Fi business. In sharp contrast, data center is now our largest end market and at 40% of total revenue is about twice as large as any of our other end markets. We believe that data center is positioned to become an even bigger part of Marvell over time, when we combine our growing market share with the numerous secular growth drivers in this end market. Over the last few years, data center has become our most diversified end market with revenue contribution from nearly every Marvell product line. Cloud is the primary growth driver in this end market, and it's exciting to note that cloud now represents more than half of our data center revenue, making cloud on its own larger than any of our other four end markets. We have grown our data center business through organic investment in our nearline HDD controllers and preamps, SSD controllers as well as significant M&A. We added Cavium's LiquidIO and LiquidSecurity DPUs, which have been adopted by multiple cloud customers. The Avera acquisition added a custom ASIC platform, which we coupled with Marvell's leading standard product IP. This has proven to be extremely compelling to hyperscale customers who are building custom hardware to deploy incredibly efficient and optimized infrastructure. We recently added Inphi's market-leading electro-optics portfolio for high-speed connectivity both within and between cloud data centers. Finally, the proposed acquisition of Innovium will add their cloud optimized Ethernet switches to our data center portfolio of products. With the broadest technology platform in the industry, we believe Marvell is well positioned to become a semiconductor leader in data center and expect this end market will be the most important growth opportunity for the company over the next several years. In carrier infrastructure, we have been significantly growing our dollar content base station, winning new customers and growing our overall market share in the 5G market. Just over the last two years, our carrier revenue has nearly tripled, representing approximately 20% of our total revenue. We expect a sustained period of strong revenue growth from this end market driven by an increase in 5G deployments, which are still on the early stage of worldwide adoption and the ramp of our full platform of 5G products and multiple customers in their current generation of base station. We have also won additional sockets in five-nanometer, which will go into production in next generation base station launches over the next several years, extending the growth from our carrier end market over a long time period. The enterprise networking end market comprises approximately 20% of our total revenue. The revenue contribution from this end market has grown rapidly and kept pace with the strong growth in Marvell's total revenue over the last few years. This is a solid accomplishment against the backdrop of challenging end market dynamics. In fact, over the last two years, our enterprise revenue has grown at 23% annual CAGR with the majority of the growth coming from standalone Marvell Ethernet switch Inphi products. These refreshed platforms have been instrumental in driving outsized revenue growth, a testament to the competitiveness of our products and technology. We believe that we are well positioned to continue outperforming the market and are looking forward to a recovery in enterprise spending that would serve as an incremental tailwind to this business. Our revenue from the automotive and industrial end market has begun to accelerate recent quarters benefiting from the ramp in our auto Ethernet connectivity business. Our automotive business is in its early stages of growth, given our design win traction and the growth expected in the adoption of Ethernet technology in cars, we expect the revenue contribution from this end market will become a larger portion of our total revenue over time. Let me now move on to discussing our second quarter results and third quarter expectations for each of our end markets starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the second quarter was $434 million, growing 57% sequentially and 62% year-over-year. Strong growth was driven by contributions from the acquired Inphi business and ongoing growth from the standalone Marvell business. Cloud customers drove the vast majority of the growth in our data center end market. Our electro-optics products continue to benefit from the adoption of PAM-based connectivity inside cloud data centers as well as the adoption of DCI or data center interconnect between regional locations. Marvell's DPUs and storage products also contributed to growth in this end market. Last quarter, we discussed a number of significant design wins, leveraging our advanced technology platform with multiple cloud customers across a variety of applications and business models. These are expected to drive a substantial step-up in our cloud revenue in the calendar 2024 to 2025 timeframe. Development is in full swing on these projects and I am pleased to report that our cloud design win momentum continues this quarter with an additional custom ASIC design secured for a cloud networking application. We expect to continue to win sockets and gain share in this market, leveraging the strength of our portfolio and growing engagements with key cloud customers. In our third fiscal quarter, we are expecting another strong performance from data center, projecting robust sequential revenue growth in the double-digits on a percentage basis. We expect year-over-year growth will be considerably higher and project data center revenue to just over double from a year-ago. We expect a sequential growth to be driven by cloud with virtually all of our product lines contributing to growth. I am also pleased to note that in the third quarter, we expect to start ramping our second-generation of COLORZ DCI products, 400-gig ZR into volume production. With our proposed acquisition of Innovium, we are looking forward to adding their cloud-optimized switches to Marvell's broad data center portfolio. We received very positive feedback from multiple key customers following our announcement of the planned combination. They are excited about the prospect of collaborating more closely with us once the acquisition closes to address their need for high performance switches going forward. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $197 million, growing 17% sequentially and 38% year-over-year. In addition to the contribution from Inphi, year-on-year growth was enabled by a standalone Marvell's wireless business. Our wireless revenue growth was driven by ongoing deployments of 5G as well as product ramps at Samsung and Nokia, partially offset by an expected decline in custom ASICs shipping into China. Design win progress continues in 5G, and I am pleased to report that we have won a next-generation ASIC design leveraging our five-nanometer technology platform within the radio unit at a key base station customer. With this win, we have now secured five-nanometer design at three Tier 1 base station customers. Our O-RAN and vRAN platform, which includes our card-based layer-1 accelerator, also continues to be adopted by multiple cloud customers and wireless base station OEMs. In the third fiscal quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth from the carrier end market, driven by strong growth from wireless, partially offset by a decline from wired. We project the strong growth in wireless in the double-digit sequentially and on a percentage basis to come from an increase in 5G deployments in multiple regions. In addition, we expect growth from 5G to significantly accelerate in the fourth quarter. On a year-over-year basis for our carrier end market, we project strong revenue growth to continue above 20% in the third quarter. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $223 million, growing 27% sequentially and 41% year-over-year with the majority of the growth coming from standalone Marvell products. This remarkable level of organic growth in the enterprise end market was made possible in part by a strong effort from our operations team to address pent-up customer demand. While we expect strong demand to continue for the foreseeable future, we expect supply constraints will impact our ability to sustain this level of revenue attainment in the third quarter. From a product perspective, growth in the second quarter was driven by our Ethernet networking portfolio, benefiting from ongoing share gains in the beginning of multi-gig adoption. We are also encouraged by strong demand for our products from customers that we believe indicator recovery is underway in this end market. Looking ahead to the third quarter, while we expect a sequential decline in revenue due to supply constraints, we anticipate strong year-over-year growth approaching 30%. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $57 million, growing 24% sequentially and 125% year-over-year, driven by the ongoing ramps in our auto business. Marvell continues to gain recognition from customers for its commitment to automotive grade quality and reliability. During the quarter, we received a prestigious Global Supplier Award from the Bosch Group in recognition of Marvell's outstanding performance and quality in the manufacture and supply of leading-edge data infrastructure semiconductors. We are looking forward to our continued partnership and long-term collaboration with Bosch on our broad and growing group of automotive customers and partners. Turning to the third fiscal quarter. We expect our revenue from the auto and industrial end market to grow sequentially. Year-over-year, we project growth will continue to be very strong and expect revenue to nearly double in the third quarter. We also expect to attain an important milestone in the third quarter. Our automotive business is projected to cross over a $100 million annualized revenue run rate earlier the prior expectation. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $165 million, declining 1% sequentially and growing 23% year-over-year. Most of the revenue in this end market is from standalone Marvell and the strong annual growth is driven primarily by our custom DIY SSD controllers. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect revenue to grow sequentially while year-over-year revenue growth will remain strong in the double-digits on a percentage basis. In closing, we expect our business momentum to gather strength in the second half of fiscal year 2022. Our recent results and near-term expectations for revenue growth continue to trend above the high-end of our target model. Demand for our products continues to significantly outpace supply and our global operations team is aggressively securing more capacity. We are working closely with our supply partners, leveraging our scale and balance sheet to improve our ability to win strong, secular growth and demand we expect for our data infrastructure products, both in the short and the long-term. For our third fiscal quarter at the midpoint of guidance, we expect revenue to grow 6% sequentially and 53% year-over-year. We expect growth from the standalone Marvell business to accelerate to over 20% year-over-year in the third quarter compared to the high-teens we achieved in the first half. Additionally, we expect the Inphi business to continue to perform well and grow faster than standalone Marvell. Our integration of Inphi is proceeding very well and we successfully achieved our one ERP milestone ahead of schedule. Leveraging the larger scale and broader set of key technologies, the combined teams are working closely together on winning new opportunities at multiple Tier 1 customers. We are also looking forward to completing the proposed acquisition of Innovium, which will broaden our Ethernet switch platform and further increase our exposure to the fast-growing cloud data center market. I am also pleased to announce that we will be hosting our Investor Day this year on Wednesday, October 6, 2021 at 8:00 a.m. Pacific. Similar to last year, this will be a virtual event webcasted live on our website. We will provide more event details in a press release shortly. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Yes. Great. Thanks, John. So with respect to enterprise, let me just frame it at the whole company level. We are still carrying pretty meaningful levels of delinquency across all of the end markets as our business has accelerated in terms of topline growth, which we've been very pleased at. I guess the downside is that the demand has continued to grow. Well, I guess it's a good thing. The demand is growing faster than supply, but we need to catch up. So enterprise is impacted, but so are the other end markets. Although I would say given the complex nature of our networking products, we're carrying relatively more \u2013 we're relatively farther behind there. We were pleased that we're able to have a strong performance in Q2 and catch up because as you can see, there was a fairly meaningful step-up in revenue. Most of that is coming from organic standalone Marvell. There is some contribution from Inphi, but it's not as \u2013 it wasn't large for Inphi. So this is all Marvell, and in fact when you look into Q3, in our guidance that still implies a 30% year-over-year growth rate in enterprise. So we could ship a lot more if we could get the products, and I think you could also view this as another sign that the enterprise business, which we had been saying a quarter or two ago could be a real tailwind for the company. This business is definitely picking up both at the end market and demand level as well as our own design wins layering in. So we're going to be working hard to increase our revenues here and catch up on the delinquency. On the foundry side, and just in general with the pricing environment, I mean, as you recall, there was a lot of commentary at the end of last year and early this year from all the major semiconductor companies relative to the supply chain cost increases that have been occurring on an ongoing basis. And that's everything from foundry to backend to substrates. We said earlier this year, we're able to work with our customers on that. And so as you can see in our margin performance, we've been able to work with them to pass that on. We've done that pretty fairly and in a neutral manner. I anticipate as we head into calendar 2022 that there will be additional increases across the industry and input costs. And I'm confident, as part of Marvell, we're able to work with our customers to again neutralize that impact. But the key focus we have right now, John, is planning our business together, focusing on long-term supply and making sure that not only can we meet the short-term, but also engage in multiple long-term agreements where we really have a much stronger visibility to long-term supply. So that's been the priority for us. That's been the priority for our customers. And I think the pricing has been second at this point. Yes. Great. Thanks, Ross. Yes. So wireless has performed very well for us. Historically, as you recall, we had seven straight quarters of sequential growth in our 5G business. That took a pause this past quarter, which we had signaled with the China 5G digestion. And then on the positive side, we see that business reaccelerating and growing in Q3 and then even more in Q4. That's primarily on the back of new design wins that we had achieved several years ago, ramping into production. And those geographies that are being serviced through those are primarily non-China. So that's really part of the \u2013 now the global rollout, which we're well positioned with our key customers there. So it's a combination of global rollout plus new content kicking in which we had been signaling for some time. So that's all going well. The balance as you mentioned is wired. That business historically wasn't terribly large for Marvell. We picked up some wired revenue from Inphi really in the coherent franchise, which does link in some ways to the growth of global data traffic. So we feel good going forward about the wired portion, that's the Inphi piece. But in general, that business is lumpier. That business also has pretty significant supply constraints around it as well. And so I'd say the traditional Marvell wired business isn't necessarily a growth business. The carrier business over time will be driven by the wireless portion as well as some of the Inphi business. And just big round numbers, the wireless portion is roughly half the carrier number, and that will grow over time, obviously as wired probably stays flattish without Inphi. Inphi will grow, and then obviously the 5G rollouts will really be what's going to drive the carrier growth over the next few years. Sure. Yes. I mean, I think it's fairly straightforward in terms of how we think about the guidance and just the broader commentary that we gave, which very much comprehends the supply that we see available, and we're obviously been pushing hard to increase that. And I would note, we have increased that. If you look even going back to a year-ago or more even at the beginning of calendar 2020, we started growing the company double digits and that growth rate for the standalone Marvell has actually accelerated, right. It was in the double-digit range. Now you get to the first half of this year, we had 17% kind of growth, both in Q1 and Q2 in the standalone Marvell business. We've said that that's going to pick up in Q3, right, more like 20% year-over-year. And we expect that we can continue going at that kind of rate. So we've been actually accelerating our ability to get supply. And then on top of that, we've got Inphi kicking in, which has also been able to grow their business meaningfully. So we've been signaling for quite some time to our supply chain that \u2013 and our suppliers that we have needs and here they are. And so you should expect that we're going to keep working on that and we're going to keep driving the supply higher as available. We've had I think a lot of productive discussions and negotiations with our key suppliers, not only for this quarter, next quarter, but next year and even beyond in terms of really lining up where we see our business heading. The advantage I think we have over some of the other industry peers perhaps is that our product life cycles, Vivek, in data infrastructure are very long. These are typically five, sometimes seven-year life cycles. So we've got very good visibility. And so we're in those discussions right now, both this quarter, next quarter blocking and tackling as well as planning our calendar 2022, and then even planning out even farther with some long-term agreements we're putting in place. But just to circle back to the main question, yes, everything we give you is centered around what we can actually supply. There's \u2013 like I said, every one of our end markets, we could ship more right now if we could get the parts. Yes. Sure, Blayne. Thanks. Yes, I'd say just, if I frame it more broadly as you mentioned the dynamic is that the ASIC and semi-custom wins that we're getting are across a broad range of applications. So it's all the above. They're everything from compute, ML, AI, networking, storage, and I'm pleased with the breadth and it's across multiple customers, multiple applications. I believe in my prepared remarks on the one that we just secured was actually in the networking area. So it's in a bunch of different applications. But it's all leveraging fundamentally, Blayne, the five-nanometer technology platform that we introduced in the summer of 2020, which is leveraging all of the high performance standard Marvell IPs. That's all going very well. And just as a side note on our five-nanometer programs are with multiple products now that have taped out this year. We actually have the first Silicon on five-nanometer coming back now imminently. And we're very happy with all the benchmarking performance et cetera. I'd also say that we're in a strong period of design win momentum, primarily because we introduced the platform in 2020, there's a whole range now of RFQs that we've been successful on closing on. And that's not just in the cloud, by the way, we also noted we won an important 5G ASIC just recently. And even across some of our other end markets, we've also secured some very important programs on five-nanometer. So yes, so I think over time, what you'll see is a very diverse offering of cloud, set of custom and semi-custom sockets across multiple end markets and multiple applications. Yes. What I'd say, Tore, is on 400ZR unlike the initial COLORZ product, which was primarily at one hyperscaler. The engagements are much more broad with 400ZR. And so I'd say there are a number of different design opportunities and wins that are at various stages of trials, qualifications and production ramps. But we anticipate that 400ZR will be multi-customer, multi-year and a very important product cycle for Marvell. But there is one primary customer ramping now, but it's going to continue beyond that. Yes. Thanks for the question Harlan. We do, we see increase in supply each quarter. Our backlog today and firm purchase orders firmly supports that plus the supply that comes with it. So we do expect sequential growth in Q4. And as you mentioned \u2013 you outlined a number of growth opportunities. This isn't just going to be a Q3, Q4 type of phenomena. Each one of these really carries into our calendar 2022 and in many cases accelerates. So that's why I said earlier in one of the prior questions, there's blocking and tackling in Q3 and Q4, but we've been really working for the last six months in detail, even longer on how do we line up continued strong growth in calendar 2022, 2023, 2024 because this is going to be multi-year and many of these engagements by the way are also multi-generational. So we tend to transition from one platform to another, and we're going to see that in our 5G business as an example. So yes, bottom line is we do have supply lined up and we're going to keep working hard to make sure we can chunk away that delinquency. And we're very focused on customer set at this point. I think that's the main driving force of what we do right now, Harlan, is just make sure that we're not the long pole in the tent that we're meeting what our customers need, and that we're also planning our business together, and I'm quite pleased with how that cooperation is going. And I think we have a very, very clear outlook for what we need to go get done in the next few quarters and through next year. Yes. I think Srini it's both. So clearly the peer companies are \u2013 I mean, there's probably one notable exception. But in general, the peer companies are reporting very strong growth in hyperscale. So I think that is secular. And I think that's very much happening. If you just look at our organic growth and you can do the math because you know sort of where Inphi was a year-ago, it's very, very strong. And in fact, as I look to Q3, it's both growth from Inphi, but as you pointed out and it's not just DPUs from Marvell, it's also our networking products with our storage products. I mean, we sell a number of product lines, let's call it 10, maybe 10 plus product lines just going into cloud alone. Almost each one of those is up even sequentially in Q3, almost all of them are up. And then if you look at year-over-year, the growth in our data center business actually \u2013 and cloud business from Marvell standalone would actually be even growing faster than the Inphi business. And that's all on the basis of new designs and new ramps contributing to that. So I think we've got growth, we've got strong secular demand happening in the hyperscale, but it's our own unique cycles. As you mentioned, the transition from NRZ to PAM and 400-gig and 200-gig intra-data center, the ramp now of 400ZR, the attach rate of DPUs, attaching more and more as a percentage to CPU's, and then you've got our own product cycles, whether they're new design wins and DIY storage for flash. I mean, I could go through the whole list, but it's \u2013 I think that's the exciting thing about our portfolio. That's very differentiated in the semiconductor industry relative to the hyperscale accounts. We have so many product lines, very unique and very differentiated both in the Silicon and the software and firmware we provide. And we're just at the early stages in some of these quite frankly, in terms of the ramp cycle. So when you look at the guide, we're going to be \u2013 obviously our guide for data center is about 2x the rate of growth for the whole company just from Q2 to Q3. And certainly we have very strong expectations heading into next year on the data center. Yes. Thanks for the question, Joe. Actually it's pretty insightful. So we're a product company, we're a technology company. We're organized by business units, we have divisions, business units and product lines, and each of those is really responsible for driving technical excellence in everything they do, product differentiation roadmap. And that's going to continue. What I would say though, is when I look at my level and when we look at, what I \u2013 and this has been consistent for five years. I had a philosophy when I became CEO, which was that the semiconductor companies that adopted a market based approach relative to looking at the R&D investment profile across its portfolio. Those companies that made that shift we're going to have the biggest level going forward. I mean, I'm just, I appreciate it internally all the time, which is the market always wins. And so we had an era when I started in the industry, which was, you just did parts as many parts as you can put them out in the data book, so you buy the parts, best part wins. There was a shift to, hey, go focus on customers, find a customer, sell a basket of products. But in the end, it's really the end market orientation and concentration which ultimately drives your business and those that the shifting that mix is like one of the hardest things to do in business, okay. You can sort of shift your product line, you can move some investment around, but to get it to flow through to the P&L is really tough. And so I think one of the things, when you just take a 30,000 foot view, Joe, of what we've accomplished in the last five years, you know, consumer, when I joined was probably 70% to 80% of the revenue, right. It's 15. I think the total contribution from cloud and 5G and auto was if it was $75 million bucks a year, we'd be lucky, okay. It's like doing, it's in the billions range today. So that's really where I've been taking the firm over the last five years through the M&A, through all the investments through the R&D changes we've made. So that we can achieve, an end market mix that really meets our long-term strategy. And we're not there yet, you know, we're, I think we're pleased; we've sort of unveiled this thing. We're 40% in data center, we're 20% in carrier, we're 20% in enterprise. We've got this automotive thing that's growing really fast. So that concentration now and where we want to be is very high, but the key focus areas like cloud, 5G and auto, those are going to continue to increase as a percentage of our total. So maybe a longer answer, Joe, we organized by business unit, but we run the company and ultimately the capital allocation framework, ultimately around the end market and even where the R&D going. And it's a very rigorous process we have internally, and you can see the results over the last five years of what we've been able to accomplish with that framework. Yes. We are here. Yes. Great. Thanks for the question. So the business today is, has been squarely focused in this pretty radical change that happened over the last few years with the internal networks of the car, moving to Ethernet based products and packet based networking. And that's for a number of reasons. The design wins we have today are extremely broad. And, we've got something like 24%, 20% to 24% car OEMs, not models, not individual products, but the actual OEMs themselves who are adopting Marvell Ethernet technology. In many cases, they've elected to go sole source with us and those engagements primarily to ensure interoperability because as you add more and more easy to use and modules inside the car that you want to hook up your Ethernet, you actually want to make sure that the link is highly reliable. We have wins both with the established leading Tier 1, call it top 10 car OEMs, but also a very strong position in the emerging challengers. All the EV startups, which when you add it all up, and of course, Tesla is a big part of the number, but there's like $700 billion, $800 billion worth of market cap tied up and do emerging EV entrance. So we've got sort of the new guys that are designing our stuff in, that's a call option on growth and then we have the established players as well. Relative to the financial \u2013 the potential, now we've said that we believe it's going to be about a $1 billion market over the next few years. And at our Analyst Day, we gave line of sight to this being a multi-hundred million dollar type of business. The business has accelerated. We had signaled last year that we were hoping to get to $25 million a quarter. Exiting the year, we guided now that we're going get there in Q3 and this business has got tremendous momentum, and you can look at the data we provided now to see how far that business has come over the last seven, eight quarters. Most of that growth that you see has been driven by the automotive contribution. So it's a big opportunity. And I think that that ultimately that $1 billion market, you go out 10 years, it'll be probably $2 billion, and we obviously hope we can get a big share of that. So it's a big opportunity. And I think the last point I would make is that it's really an entry now because it's such a key part of the car architecture that we're very, very focused now on applications outside of Ethernet. So compute applications, additional networking products, security and storage and we've really proven ourselves. Final point, we've shipped millions and millions of units now into cars that are on the road. We're running at \u2013 an astonishing one DPPM type of quality rate, or actually less. In fact, the most recent update I got is we were in the 800, 900 PPB, which I can tell you having a lot of experience in the automotive market, it's really hard to get under one. And the products have been engineered extremely well. We put in place like a world-class automotive flow. So we can leverage that, Toshi, for many other Marvell technologies and products outside of Ethernet. And you should expect to hear more from us on this in the future. Yes, sure. So think of this as our traditional industry standard servers, host bus adapter cards, enterprise mix, things like that. So that business historically has been pretty flat. And just to clarify the campus networking products, that's an enterprise networking, so that's moves to the enterprise line. So we've gone through pretty carefully and just figured out which \u2013 what our revenue concentration is specifically in the enterprise on-prem side. So that we assume it's going to be a flattish business. It's been a flattish business. It'll have its ups and downs here and there. All the growth is going to come from cloud. And so as we mentioned, it's over half of the revenue today, and even if you look to Q3, the acceleration and growth you see is coming from that portion. And we expect the cloud to be probably one of the biggest growth drivers of the whole company over the next few years. I mean, cloud alone is larger than carrier, larger than enterprise, larger than consumer, larger than anything else, just on its own \u2013 as its own line item, and that should continue to see very outsized growth for the foreseeable the future. Yes. There you go. Yes. You're asking some great questions. Let me give you maybe a higher level view and then we've got \u2013 as we mentioned, our Analyst Day coming up in October, where you're going to be able to hear actually from the various executives running these groups, and they'll talk in a lot more detail about sort of the questions you're asking because that's fairly specific, but at the highest level 400ZR is going to be a combination, okay, of both modules as well as standalone DSPs. The team has lined up with number of partners, both for the ZR applications, ZR plus there's an open version of that, and then there's also applications for this that are not DCI, right, that are actually in the carrier market. And so there's a broad opportunity here Quinn, besides just, \u201cHey, we take the one hyperscaler we had, we are moving to 400ZR and then it's done.\u201d It's not that at all. And the initial ramp we are seeing is based on modules and we're continuing to be committed to that. That's a good business for us. But the Inphi team, I think, had done a great job of lining up a broader ecosystem set of partners to drive DSP sales as well. So we'll give more color on those dynamics, when we get into the Investor Day and we start talking more about our products and our technologies. Yes. You're welcome."

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Revenue in the second quarter was $1.076 billion, $11 million above the midpoint of guidance. Networking represented 65% of our revenue with storage contributing 32%. Revenue from other accounted for 3% of our revenue. As Ashish mentioned earlier, starting with the third quarter, we will only report revenue by our five end market to provide a more transparency about the key growth drivers of our business. GAAP gross margin was 34.6%, which included the amortization of Inphi inventory step-up cost. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.8% of revenue, 80 basis points above the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to a better mix. GAAP operating expenses were $638 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $366 million, approximately $6 million below the midpoint of guidance, primarily due to faster-than-expected Inphi synergy achievement and disciplined OpEx management. I am confident that our team will achieve the remaining Inphi integration synergies based on the plan we discussed last quarter. Given the significant growth opportunities ahead of us, we are turning our focus to ensuring continued investment to support our long-term profitable growth. As a reminder, our operating expenses can vary quarter-to-quarter affected by factors such as the number of tape-outs within a particular quarter, and these tape-outs are becoming more expensive in newer process geometry. The cadence of NRE payment which we treat as the contra OpEx can also add variability. Our GAAP operating loss was $267 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $331 million or 38.8% of revenue. For the second quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.34. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.34. Now turning to our balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $222 million. We returned $49 million to shareholders through dividend payment. Our long-term debt was $4.7 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.4x and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3x. Inventory at the end of second quarter was $460 million. We amortized $156 million of the Inphi inventory step-up cost in the second quarter due to purchase price accounting and we anticipate amortizing the remaining balance of $17 million by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Now turning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2022. Please note this guidance does not include any contributions from the pending acquisition of Innovium. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.145 billion plus or minus 3%. We expect our GAAP gross margin in the range of 46.3% to 48.3%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 64% to 65%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $584 million to $594 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $365 million to $370 million. We expect non-GAAP tax rate of 5%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 824 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 841 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP loss per share in the range of $0.10, plus or minus $0.04. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.38, plus or minus $0.03. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. Hey, Ambrish. This is Jean. Yes, firstly we're very pleased with our strong Q2 gross margin performance. And I think a lot of the things we discussed in the past is the primary driver of our gross margin is really a product mix. And what we have been doing with the customers as Matt mentioned is that we're working with the customers, really try to minimize the impact from all the input cost increase. But overall, if you think about the product portfolio we have in data center, as Matt just mentioned earlier and also enterprise in Q2, we see our enterprise business, networking business growing 27% sequentially. All those significant performance on the product portfolio on the revenue side actually are very favorable to our gross margin. Fundamentally it's a reflection of our investment in the IP. So I don't think that will change because we continue to innovate, we continue to invest to drive the portfolio and the topline revenue growth. So we're going to be in the range and we'll continue to work with the customers to set priorities and to make sure we meet the customer's need first and then definitely we want to make sure our operating model continue to leverage to expand the operating profit going forward. The range is the product mix because we have a five end market. Quarter-over-quarter, you're going to see the variability of the mix change. Frankly, what we discussed the 64% to 65% that range is potentially you are going to see in the long-term. Maybe the easy one first. On the non-GAAP tax rate for next year, you'll probably can just model about 6% because we do have a lot of the tax deductions as part of our merger with Inphi. So that's the assumption you can model. On the OpEx rate, our team did a great job to integrate the one ERP one quarter ahead of the time. So if you look at the synergy achievement we outlined last quarter, we basically achieved the one ERP one quarter earlier, so the OpEx came off in Q2 and then Q3 guidance, frankly, as I said earlier, we do see the pattern of synergy achievement just exactly the same as we outlined last quarter. So Q4, typically, there are variabilities of OpEx. I think, I will leave it to you to model it, but from our perspective, we are quite confident to achieve the Inphi synergy, at the same time the seasonality of OpEx in Q1, you're absolutely right, typically Q1 because of the payroll tax, the OpEx will step up. I just want to make sure, right, the team at Marvell is very thoughtful in managing OpEx, but at the same time increase the investment to drive the long-term revenue growth. Especially given the tremendous opportunities we have ahead of us, we are going to make sure we invest, but at the same time, we always going to drive revenue growth significantly higher than the OpEx growth. Maybe I'll \u2013 I'll give you the definition then Matt can add. On the on-premise data center, that's part of the data center is really, frankly, it's our \u2013 some of the HDD business, Fiber Channel business and the Networking business it's on-premise data center, but more than half its actually cloud data center. Matt, you can add more."

        "content": "Operator: Good afternoon, and welcome to the Marvell Technologies Fiscal First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask question. Please note that, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO. I would like to remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available on our website in the Investor Relations section. We closed the acquisition of Inphi on April 20, 2021. Therefore, the results we reported today for the first quarter of fiscal 2022 include the results from the Inphi business for 10 days of the fiscal quarter. Revenue from the acquired Inphi business is reported within our networking product group. To provide a direct comparison to the first fiscal quarter business outlook we provided in our earnings call on March 3, we have provided a table in our earnings press release, which breaks out Marvell standalone non-GAAP results for the first quarter, excluding partial quarter results from the acquired Inphi business. We are providing Marvell's standalone non-GAAP results only on a one-time basis. As a reminder, there are no GAAP results for standalone Marvell. Matt and Jean's first quarter commentary will primarily focus on the non-GAAP results from the standalone Marvell business as it relates to the guidance we provided on our March 3 call understated otherwise. Please note that, the financial outlook for the second quarter of fiscal year 2022 includes expected results from the acquired Inphi business for the full quarter. On the subject of revenue reporting, as you know, we currently report revenue in three broad product groups: networking, storage and other. However, as you may recall, during our Investor Day presentations, we also describe our addressable opportunities by end market. This market focus will provide more information and transparency about the key growth drivers of our business and was received positively by the investment community. We are now taking steps to align our external revenue reporting to our end markets. We believe this will provide investors with a better and more granular understanding of our business. Accordingly, we will discontinue reporting revenue by product group and instead, we will report revenue from the following five end markets: data center, carrier, enterprise networking, auto industrial and consumer. Please note, we will implement this change starting next quarter, when we report results for our second quarter of fiscal 2022. In that earnings release, we will report revenue by end market for the second quarter and provide historical end market revenue data for the preceding seven quarters. Mass discussion of business results and expectations are also transitioned to this end market view. In our second quarter earnings results, on a one-time basis, we will provide revenue results under both the current product group process and the new end market process. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter GAAP results for the combined company. Revenue for the combined company was $832 million. GAAP gross margin was 50.2% and loss per diluted share was $0.13. I'm now going to review standalone Marvell non-GAAP results, excluding those of Inphi. We began fiscal 2022 on a strong note, delivering solid results in the first quarter, driven by the strength of our core businesses and continued operational excellence. Marvell standalone revenue for the first quarter was $810 million, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue grew 17% year-on-year, driven by robust growth in both our networking and storage businesses. Higher revenue, coupled with stronger gross margin and lower operating expenses, drove non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.02 above the midpoint of guidance to $0.29. Non-GAAP EPS grew 61% year-on-year, demonstrating the significant operating leverage in our business model. I'm pleased that Marvell delivered the fourth straight quarter of double-digit year-on-year revenue growth, despite industry-wide supply constraints that have tightened considerably over the same time period. In fact, our year-on-year growth rate accelerated in the first quarter on strong and growing demand across all our end markets, and I'm pleased that our operations team rose to the challenge in a difficult environment. But we have more work to do. Majority of our products are proprietary and sole-sourced and demand for our solutions continues to grow. We need to support our customers with a flexible supply chain capable of delivering to upside demand within a reasonable lead time, something that has not been feasible this year. To further improve our supply, Chris Koopmans, who has played an instrumental role in Marvell's ongoing transformation, has been appointed as our Chief Operations Officer to lead our global operations and supply chain organization, in addition to his current role leading marketing and business operations. Chris is leveraging his deep understanding of our markets and customers to prioritize and align supply to our key growth initiatives. We are extending our planning horizons, strengthening strategic supplier partnerships and using our balance sheet where appropriate, to build more flexibility. Our suppliers value Marvell's focus on data infrastructure as a source of sustainable growth, driven by favorable secular trends compared to other cyclical end markets. And as a result, they are excited to partner with us. Looking to the second half of this fiscal year, we are confident that we have secured sufficient supply to enable accelerating year-on-year revenue growth for standalone Marvell, above that of the first half. We expect supply to further improve next fiscal year. In a few moments, I'll discuss Inphi's business, where we also expect strong revenue growth throughout the year. Moving on to our merger with Inphi and related organizational changes. We received regulatory approval to merge with Inphi in April, earlier than originally anticipated and began integrating the talented Inphi team. We have emerged from this transaction as a U.S. Corporation, which we believe better positions the combined company for long-term success. Reflecting the larger scale and broader scope of Marvell, several key Inphi executives have joined my direct staff. Loi Nguyen and Nariman Yousefi will manage the Inphi businesses and have also increased their scope to include additional Marvell businesses. Lawrence Tse, Inphi's central engineering leader, will manage Marvell's analog and mixed signal organization. In addition, Raghib Hussain has taken on a broader elevated role as President, Products and Technologies, to drive strategy alignment and growth across the company. Similar to our prior acquisitions, we expect the infusion of Inphi talent will add scale and further strengthen the capabilities of the combined company. We have built a world-class management team with deep technical expertise, vast industry experience and a proven track record in driving growth and value creation. Let me move on now to discussing our two businesses in more detail. Networking. First, for Marvell standalone networking, revenue grew during the first - revenue during the first quarter was $476 million, consistent with our outlook for strong growth. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 9%, underpinned by growth in all key product lines with the exception of 5G ASICs. However, overall 5G revenue continued to grow, marking our seventh straight consecutive quarter of growth. Year-on-year growth was a very robust 21% in networking, with solid contributions from multiple end markets. In 5G, growth was driven by standard and semi-custom product shipments to Samsung and Nokia, partially offset by a decline in ASICs as deployments in China paused. In cloud networking, we continue to benefit from strong customer demand for our SmartNIC DPUs. In automotive, we are growing rapidly with our Ethernet product shipping into multiple model year 2021 vehicles. Our Enterprise Networking business also delivered solid results, extending the double-digit growth trend established last year, despite a soft end market. This performance is a result of our expanding market position, driven by our refreshed Ethernet switches and multi-gigabit PHYs. To the extent, the enterprise spending recovers later this year, that would be another tailwind to our business. Not only are we winning and ramping in the access, aggregation and core switching markets, we are also making inroads in the data center with our feature-rich and scalable multi-terabit family of switches. As a reminder, these products leverage a modular architecture to deliver multiple capacity points, from 3.2 terabits per second to 12.8 terabits for a broad range of data center applications. We have been winning new sockets and expect these design wins to start contributing meaningfully higher levels of revenue next fiscal year. Let me now discuss the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 for our Networking business. This outlook includes revenue from Inphi's complete electro-optics platform comprised of their industry-leading PAM and coherent DSPs, high-performance broadband analog drivers and TIAs, highly integrated silicon photonics and data center interconnect modules. For the second quarter, we anticipate networking revenue to grow just over 70% year-on-year. Let me walk you through the growth expectations from the Marvell and Inphi businesses implicit in this guidance. We expect Marvell's standalone networking to drive strong year-on-year revenue growth in the high teens on a percentage basis and be up slightly on a sequential basis. Similar to the prior quarter, we expect broad growth from multiple products, offset by a pause in China 5G. This outlook reflects ongoing supply constraints, which have more - been more acute for our networking products. However, as I discussed earlier, we believe we have line of sight to supply improvements later this year and next year to support our growth plans. As we look forward, we expect a strong second half ramp compared to the first half in standalone Marvell's networking business, including an acceleration in our 5G business from both our own product ramps and an increase in 5G adoption in the U.S. and other regions. From the acquired Inphi business, we expect approximately $215 million in revenue in our second fiscal quarter. I am very pleased that at this level of revenue, we expect the Inphi business will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings in the first full quarter as a combined company. We expect this business to drive strong growth above Marvell's growth rate, benefiting from the demand for high-speed connectivity inside and between data centers and in the carrier market. Let me briefly discuss Inphi's data center growth drivers. Inside data centers, as demand for bandwidth continues to increase, a generational shift is underway from traditional NRZ signaling to more advanced Pulse Amplitude Modulation, or PAM, which enables a significant increase in bandwidth. This is one of the biggest changes in data center connectivity, and Inphi is leading this industry transition. Inphi is the largest provider of PAM4 DSPs to the optical connectivity market, having shipped millions of devices. As the market continues to transition to higher speeds, 400-gig adoption has been accelerating. And last year, we started sampling our next-generation 800-gig solution, which is seeing strong traction with customers. In collaboration with Microsoft, Inphi pioneered pluggable transceiver technology to directly interconnect regional cloud data centers at lower cost, complexity and power compared to traditional optical transport solutions. The first product, COLORZ use PAM4 technology to enable 100-gig per wavelength, which could be multiplexed to support up to 4 terabits per second of bandwidth over a single fiber for data center interconnect or DCI applications. This product has been shipping in volume and established Inphi's leadership in this category. Building on the success of COLORZ, which was deployed primarily by one hyperscaler last year, Inphi introduced COLORZ II, the industry's first pluggable transceiver compatible with the 400ZR industry standard, which enables 400-gig per wavelength using coherent technology. We expect to maintain our leadership position in the DCI market and project that COLORZ II deployments will start this year. With an industry standard now in place, we see multiple hyperscalers and additional customers adopting pluggable ZR technology, which creates a significantly larger revenue opportunity for our DCI platform. Turning now to our storage business. Storage revenue for the first quarter was $303 million, growing 17% year-on-year and declining 7% sequentially. Results were better than our expectations as we benefited from stronger demand for SSD controllers. The stellar year-on-year results were driven by ramps in our custom DIY SSD controller programs and ongoing growth in cloud demand for nearline drives, which benefited from - benefited our HDD controllers and pre-amplifiers. The sequential decline was primarily due to our Fiber Channel business. Looking to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect storage to deliver another strong performance driven by the nearline HDD and data center SSD markets. We are projecting revenue to grow year-on-year in the mid-teens and in the double-digits sequentially on a percentage basis. Our recent results and expectations for ongoing growth reflect the significant transformation of our storage business. In our HDD business, data center has become the largest revenue contributor relative to other markets. Our preamplifier business is now ramped up to an annualized run rate of over $50 million, and we believe that we can more than double this run rate. We are continuing to step up the technology cadence for our SSD controllers, and we recently introduced the industry's first PCIe Gen5 SSD controller family designed to address the data movement and security challenges in cloud infrastructure. We are excited to collaborate directly with hyperscalers and NAND vendors to bring this leading solution to market. In addition, I'm pleased to announce that a key NAND OEM has chosen to partner with Marvell to develop custom PCIe Gen5 and Gen6 SSD controllers for their enterprise and cloud solutions. The Gen6 product will be built on our 5-nanometer process. In the storage market, this is a quantum leap and process node cadence and is a testament to Marvell's advanced technology platform. We expect to leverage the leading-edge IP we are developing to be deployed in additional advanced node storage solutions. Our strategy to refocus this business on the data center market has been a huge success. Data center has grown to over 60% of storage revenue from less than 20% in fiscal 2017. In closing, we had a great start to fiscal 2022, and I'm very excited about the growth prospects in front of us as a combined company. When we announced the acquisition of Inphi, we increased our long-term target model for revenue growth to 12% to 16% annually. I'm pleased that our recent results and near-term expectations are, in fact, currently trending above the high end of this target range. This is primarily due to our own product cycles, combined with sustainable, secular growth trends in our data infrastructure markets. The acquisition of Inphi has increased our exposure to the data center, which is our largest end market. And within that, cloud is the largest growth opportunity across Marvell, significantly bigger than our 5G opportunity. Inphi has already established a strong position within cloud, addressing an opportunity growing at a 60% plus CAGR. The Marvell organic opportunity in cloud is also substantial, which we are addressing with our merchant, semi-custom and flexible ASIC model for compute, networking, acceleration, security and storage applications. At our Analyst Day last year, we discussed this opportunity growing at an expected 19% CAGR to over $5 billion by calendar 2023. The adoption of ARM processors and servers continues to gain traction, and this further increases our cloud opportunity. We expect cloud revenue for the combined company to grow rapidly. As Marvell's 5-nanometer products come to market, we expect a substantial step-up in our cloud revenue. I'm very pleased to report that we have been recently awarded a number of significant design wins, leveraging our advanced technology platform. Respecting customer confidentiality, we will not be in a position to discuss any specific win. They are with multiple customers across a variety of applications and business models. We expect these products to start ramping into production in calendar 2023, achieving peak revenue in the calendar 2024 to 2025 timeframe. As I approach my five-year anniversary at Marvell, I've never felt stronger about our growth prospects, and I'm grateful to all our employees who have worked hard to transform the company to position us for what we believe will be a very exciting future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nJean Hu: Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our GAAP results for the first quarter for the combined company, followed by Marvell's standalone non-GAAP performance and conclude with our outlook. Please note, our GAAP financials include 10 days of results from the Inphi business and the impact of purchase price comping items, share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, vehicle segment and acquisition related costs. Revenue was $832 million. GAAP gross margin was 50.2%. GAAP operating expenses were $500 million. GAAP operating loss was $82 million. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.13. Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $538 million, which include the impact of setting up Inphi's inventory by $187 million due to purchase price accounting. We amortized the $40 million of this step-up into cost of goods sold in the first quarter, and we anticipate amortizing the remaining balance by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022. During the quarter, we paid $140 million in cash for fees related to the Inphi transaction. Excluding those one-time payments, our cash flow generation from operations would have been $100 million. As a reminder, our cash flow generation has seasonality and tend to be lower in our first fiscal quarter due to the payment for annual cash bonus to employees. In the first quarter, we distributed $41 million to shareholders in dividends. We accept the quarter with $523 million in cash and short-term investments. Our long-term debt was $4.7 billion and currently carries the blended interest rate of approximately 2.5%. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.9, and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.4, based on combined pro forma EBITDA. We continue to have a strong investment-grade credit profile. Our capital allocation priorities over the next 12 months are to maintain our current dividend level, and utilize our free cash flow to pay down debt used for the acquisition for Inphi. We believe we can drive strong revenue growth and free cash flow generation to quickly achieve our target ratio of 2 times gross debt-to-EBITDA. I'll now move on to standalone Marvell non-GAAP results. As Ashish had noted earlier, we are providing standalone Marvell results on a onetime basis this quarter because our previously provided financial outlook for the first quarter excluded any impact of the Inphi acquisition. Reconciliation of our standalone and combined performance as well as GAAP to non-GAAP results available in our press release. Standalone Marvell revenue in the first quarter was $810 million, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Networking represented 60% of our revenue with storage contributing 36%. Revenue from other accounted for 4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.3%, above our guidance and the 150-basis point improvement from a year ago, primarily due to better product mix and our team's continued effort to drive operational excellence. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $297 million as we continue to tightly manage our expenses while investing for growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.7%, an 810-basis point increase from a year ago, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.29, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.02 and is up more than 60% year-over-year. Let me now comment on our plan for operating expenses going forward. After closing the Inphi acquisition, the starting pro forma operating expense trend rate for the combined company was approximately $375 million per quarter. We expect our operating expenses to grow annually in the range of 4% to 5% as we continue to invest to support our long-term growth, including incremental R&D spending for Inphi. However, we expect to more than offset this operating expense growth through deal-related synergies. We expect total cost of synergies for $125 million from the Inphi acquisition with approximately $100 million coming from operating expenses. The midpoint of our second quarter OpEx guidance of $372.5 million includes $10 million of synergy achievement on a run rate basis. We expect to achieve half of our targeted OpEx synergy exiting fiscal 2022 and the full synergy realization by the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We'll continue to be disciplined in allocating resources and expect to drive revenue growth significantly higher than OpEx growth to deliver strong earnings expansion. The remaining $25 million of cost synergies will come from cost goods sold, which we expect to start to take effect in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and be fully realized by the third quarter of the same year. Our team has a strong track record of integration execution from prior acquisitions. I'm very confident about our synergy achievement plan. Now, turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which included a full quarter of Inphi. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.065 billion, plus or minus 3%. At the middle point of this outlook, we expect approximately $250 million of revenue contribution from the Inphi business. As Matt mentioned earlier, at this level of revenue, we expect the Inphi business will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings. We expect our GAAP gross margin in the range of 34.8% to 37.5%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 64%. In a tight supply environment, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin in the near future to remain around this level, subject to product mix change in any given quarter. We project our GAAP operating expense to be in the range of $633 million to $643 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million. Following the Inphi acquisition, the company domicile changed from Bermuda to Delaware. Based on tax deductions and credits we have, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 5% for the remainder of the fiscal year. And the current tax laws, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to increase by approximately 100 basis points each year for the next couple of years. We expect other expenses will be approximately $34.5 million, which include interest expense of $33 million. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 822 million and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be $835 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP loss per share to be $0.37, plus or minus $0.04. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share to be $0.31, plus or minus $0.03. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJohn Pitzer: Yes. Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations on the solid results. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Matt, I'm just sort of curious, when you look at sort of this quarter and the guide, can you help us better understand relative to your ability to capture supply? The deficiencies grow this quarter, you did a nice job in the core networking business growing almost 9% sequentially, but I'm trying to get a sense as to whether or not demand continues to outstrip supply. And if you could help us understand, is this a wafer issue? Or are there other issues? And as you think about resolving them in the back half of the year, why so confident?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Great, John. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're very happy with the results in networking. I mean, as you pointed out, that was a sequential number. So clearly, business has been very, very good for us in networking. And certainly, year-over-year, to do 20%-plus is great. The demand, John, continues in Q2 and beyond. We're continuing to work on improving the supply on our networking products. As it turns out, and as you've probably seen, the complexity on our networking business in terms of the manufacturing, cycle time supply chain is much more complex and challenging than on the storage side. So we've been able to meet some more of the upsides on storage than we have networking. But no, John, business continues to be strong. We do have line of sight to the supply improving in the second half, which is encouraging. And that's why we're continuing to be very bullish about the outlook for our overall networking business because the demand is clearly there, and we've now got supply coming online in the back half as well as into next year. So things are improving for sure.\nJohn Pitzer: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Matt, I had one more and to kind of extend that question into the second half visibility from two aspects. One is the supply aspect, that is supply coming online gradually. Or are you planning to see perhaps a faster improvement on the supply side? And the other perspective on this is how much of your second half growth - fiscal year growth is dependent on enterprise and China 5G recovery, which have tended to be quite volatile?\nMatt Murphy: Sure, Vivek. Yes. I think, look, in this environment, in general, supply is coming in, not in large chunks. Although, I would say, given the ramp we had been planning for some time, in our case, we do see more significant amount of supply coming in, in the second half. So that will improve, and we have visibility of that, both on the wafer side as well as on the back-end side. And at the same time, as we ramp our supply position, as I mentioned to John, the demand side continues to outstrip our ability to supply at all, but we're making good progress there. On your second question, in both cases, both in enterprise as well as China 5G, those are not comprehended to have market-related comebacks in that time frame. On enterprise, as you've seen, I mean, we've been growing that business well above double-digit for some time, including in our Q1, and we do anticipate that to continue. Now that's mostly on the back of our own product cycles, okay? And we've been very successful, I think, in our enterprise and campus switching, also in our PHY business. And so that continues. So that's - and by the way, and what's been viewed as a very soft market, both by the OEMs as well as other semiconductor peers. So if that end market improves with return to work and vaccinations improving, that would be a pretty significant tailwind on our business. As it relates to 5G in China, maybe just to kind of frame it in the bigger picture, I think, first, our own team internally, I want to give them credit, they did a good job for - in the first half, telling us last year that the mapping out the digestion phase, which is what's happened, so that's actually been in line with our plan. And we're not necessarily counting on a big recovery in that in the second half. If it does, that would be great. But just to frame it, Vivek, in the bigger picture, our 5G business and exposure in China is actually less than 20% of our overall 5G business, both now and even going forward. And in fact, it probably slowly becomes a smaller percentage over time as our new OEMs ramp up and some of these other initiatives kick in. So again, either of those two came back very strong, that would also be a tailwind on our business.\nVivek Arya: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Matt, I know it's probably early to ask this question, but can you give us a sense of sort of what kind of synergies you might see on the revenue side? I know you're not putting any of those into the model, but can you talk about that? And then I guess also, Jean, I was just wondering if you can talk about what the normalized gross margin is. I know you're guiding to 64%, but it sounds like that's still being hampered by some constraints. So I'm kind of wondering what is the right normalized number if you didn't have those? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes, Tim, I'll take the first part and then we'll hand it to Jean. So yes, as you noted, historically, we've - just by practice, not tried to articulate or size revenue synergies when we announced the deal. It's just very hard to do. And quite frankly, it's very hard to even measure in the rearview mirror. But that being said, on all of these transactions we've done, we can look back and we can actually point to cases where one plus one was way over two. And it kind of comes in two pieces. The first is really what I would call the customer revenue synergy, Tim, which would be we have products that we can sell, for example, into 5G or the cloud and Inphi, in this case, would as well. And in those discussions, the notion that we can be a better supplier together really comes together. I mean if you remember back in the - after the Cavium transaction, I think that was very significant, what happened with - in 5G and with Samsung, where together, we were able to get effectively the whole platform, where a part we had actually very little content. So I do - I'm very encouraged by what we see. I think customers really like the combination to a person, and those are very strong. And I believe we will see cases we can point to. It's already underway. The second part of it is really more of a technical one, which is how do we actually incorporate the intellectual property of the two companies, put it together and deliver better solutions. Those discussions are also going well, in particular, with the Inphi, SerDes, IP as it relates to our ASIC business, our roadmap into co-packaged optics and our vision of optics everywhere and not just co-packaging and with the switch, but also in things like AI and ML ASICs and DPUs. So that's going to be a very critical piece of the puzzle as we enter these complex markets, and more and more the connectivity moves to electro-optic solution. So that, I think, Tim, is - we're very, very excited about all that. I think it's going to work out very well on both of those fronts, I mentioned. Let me hand it over to Jean to cover the second question.\nJean Hu: On your gross margin question, as you remember, when we announced the Inphi deal, we actually guided the combined company gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 66%. We are actually very pleased with our Q1 gross margin performance. Marvell standalone actually achieved 64.3% under a very tight supply chain environment. As we said before, Inphi actually is accretive to our gross margin. I think the dynamics, as all you know, is supply chain is very tight. And we are trying to really manage it through the supply chain challenge, but we do think the combined company with the Inphi margin higher than 65%, we're going to trend higher going forward when we combine both companies, drive the top line revenue growth.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks for taking my questions. Just curious on the storage outlook, I heard you say nearline in SSD. Is that kind of the seasonal ramp of DIY and any other drivers to point out? And I'm just curious on fiber channel spend kind of yoyo. Is that going back in July as well?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Great question, Blayne, on storage. So, a couple of things. So on the SSD side, yes, that's actually multiple DIY programs now. Those are kicking in, in various end markets, and we see that trend being obviously way up year-over-year this year, but growing strongly into next year. So I think that strategy to really work closely with some of these system-level OEMs, whether it\u2019d be in the cloud or other applications. It's a pretty compelling business model. So, that one is going well. On the cloud or on the nearline side, yes, I mean, I think if you just look at the performance of these large cloud properties and how they're performing in terms of their own revenue growth. There's certainly a scaling that goes on with the storage. So, the need for increase capacity in cold storage continues. We're well-positioned with that with our controllers and our preamplifiers, actually which is a new revenue stream for us as well. So that's still continuing and that's very strong. And then finally, the fiber channel, it was one of our most stable businesses, Blayne going back even when Cavium owned it, even when it was QLogic. It certainly have a lot of choppiness this year with manufacturing supply disruptions in Southeast Asia. That's started to stabilize. Actually, fiber channel grew quarter-over-quarter and will continue to get better. And we hope that, that will - just by design that should be a much more stable business. So yes, overall, just I think you've heard in my remarks, I mean, we're just - it's been a journey on the storage side, and I've just got to thank our entire team for fundamentally transforming a business, which, if you go back 5 years ago when I showed up, and this wasn't just me, the whole management team, this was a business that was highly concentrated, HDD controllers only, selling all into 2.5-inch notebooks, okay? And that was sort of the story and the melting ice cube people were worried about. And so I'm very proud of the team when I fast forward 5 years, and we've now got greater than 60% of our storage business in data center and these high-performance applications and then really the bulk of the balance being in very sticky, stable markets. And the exposure to things like notebooks being deminimis, I think it's been a great transformation story. And the fact that we're having calls talking about our storage business growing double digits and continuing to do that is great effort. And by the way, we're not milking this business either. I mean, we've been very aggressive to move our platform to 5-nanometer, which effectively jumped at least a node for most people, probably for most people with 2 or 3 nodes. But for these high-performance applications, Blayne, especially in the data center, you get tremendous power savings by doing this. So that's going to be a first step into a broader platform of products in storage as well as in our traditional networking businesses like processors and switch chips.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nRoss Seymore: Let me ask a question and looking forward to hearing the end market split last quarter, so thanks proactively for doing that. Matt, I want to go to the networking business again. And the last 4 quarters has kind of been up 10% then flat, up 10% and now guided flat again. Overall, year-over-year growth is really, really strong. So no complaints, but is that lumpiness something that's just inherent to the markets that you're addressing? Was it supply driven? And perhaps more importantly, you talked about an acceleration in the back half of the year. Can you just talk about a few of the Marvell-specific drivers that will allow that acceleration? And do you expect that lumpiness to go away as the breadth of the business improves internally and with the addition of Inphi?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Great questions. So just quickly on the first one. Actually, we're - I'm pretty excited about moving to the end market reporting. I think it's going to give investors a much growth drivers. It actually reflects how we think about allocating the capital of the company. I mean I've actually managed the company from a market-based philosophy from the very beginning. And so to now be able to show you our data center business, there's also peers that report those numbers, so it will give investors a sense of our relative growth rates. And then carrier, you can capture our 5G anyway. So I think that will be a real positive thing for everybody. On the networking side, it's interesting, Ross, that individually, some of these businesses are inherently lumpy. I mean I think we all know that the carrier telecom-type businesses tend to be lumpier than others. That being said, when you blend actually our combined networking businesses across things like enterprise and carrier and even right now, automotive is reported in our networking, actually, from an end demand standpoint, you do get a smoother profile, which has all been up into the right by the way. I think in the last year, the dynamic on the quarterly moves has been more supply related than it has been just, 'Hey, networking was up and then everybody kind of slowed down together and everybody is up. Actually, business has been very strong, Ross since last year. If you recall, we started growing the company double digits year-over-year in Q2 of last year. So we've been on this double-digit growth rate. Now we're - it's actually accelerating. And during this time frame, if we could get more supply, it would probably look a lot - look smoother, if you will. But I think you're right to integrate it over maybe a few quarter period, first half, second half or even one-year period to get the full view just because the manufacturing cycle times of some of these products can be several quarters. So if you get upside, there's a time to react. But no, if you just sort of blended end demand, Ross, you'd see a very steady increase. And the nice thing is we have a very diversified business in networking. So it's spread across all these end markets, as I mentioned.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Matt, I wanted to ask about a comments you made at the top of the call, which was you're feeling really confident about just starting a new phase of a multiyear growth. I just wanted to double-click on that, what are the underpinnings of that confidence? Can you talk a little bit about the design wins you have on the cloud side? And then you also gave a bit of a hint when you talked about cloud being a much larger opportunity than 5G? Just kind of frame that discussion in - with that in mind as well. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure, Ambrish. I mean, I would say both in the relative near term, okay, and over the next several years. I actually break it into three phases. There's the sort of second half of this year, looking into next year and the year after, and then I would say, out a few years beyond that. I think - and I didn't quite answer Ross' question, but I'll weave it in here. This last one was what do you see in the second half? So in networking, for example, I mean, we have the 5G ramp for us will pick up, will accelerate. That's primarily due to increased adoption in the United States and deployments there plus design wins that we have won several years ago ramping into production. You've got a very strong Marvell business in the cloud with our SmartNIC product line, that's been growing very, very nicely and will continue in the second half. I'm surprised no one asked the question about Inphi yet, but we're very pleased to guide 215 for Inphi in Q2, which is, I think, well above what anybody thought. That business is also going to continue to accelerate in the second half, both on the intra-data center business in PAM4 as well as the 400ZR ramp, which we think will be meaningful next year, but also starting this year. And then finally, as I mentioned, the Ethernet switch and PHY business, you could also throw automotive in there. I mean, we got almost all of these growth drivers we mentioned continue. So that's right in front of us. I think what I get very excited about, as you alluded to, is the design win momentum in the company has been extremely strong. And probably - not probably, as strong as I've ever seen it in the past five years I've been here and any kind of prior record I could find. And those are things that, as we noted in my remarks, would be designs we win now that would ramp up starting probably in calendar 2023, 2024 and then go beyond that and that's also you would - you should kind of tie it together with that was when our 5-nanometer platform will be really in full production across multiple end customers, end markets and end applications. So that's one that kind of layers on top of all of this and candidly, would extend beyond what we talked about at the last Investor Day. So I think if you draw a line between here and there, there's all kinds of goodness in different areas, Ambrish, but I think we're feeling really good about the investments we made. I think the acquisitions that we did positioned us really well and they fit together in their own way. And I think - and finally, I would say that the customer go-to-market, our brand promise to our customers, the way we engage, the way we partner, resonates really well in this environment. And we're just - we're viewed as a very credible and reliable partner with scale now, especially with Inphi and to really deliver the most complex critical products that our customers need.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Matt, I'm sorry, just a clarification. This design win momentum does not include Inphi. So that would be on top of this, right? So this is what you're talking about, the organic business has been working on, right?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. This is just Marvell, standalone. So all those comments on largest sort of design type win achievement we've seen plus the funnel, that's all from the organic Marvell business, okay? Starting next quarter, we're going to have the Inphi team in our results and in our internal results in terms of our design win funnel and momentum. But yes, they've done a great job, too. I mean that's the whole other story. But I'm just saying standalone Marvell with our 5-nanometer platform and our 5G cloud strategy, automotive, all the things we articulated at the Investor Day, pre-Inphi, that's all tracking the in line or better than we thought.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon and congratulations on the solid results and outlook. On the newly acquired Inphi business unit, it looks like inside cloud data center upgrade to 200 and 400-gig PAM4 optical connectivity is accelerating as we move into the second half with two more cloud titans just starting to upgrade cycle. And then on top of that, it looks like the first or two cloud titans are starting to fire on the data center to data center DCI optical upgrade, the new 400-gig ZR standard. As you mentioned, the team has a strong leadership position in both of these areas. Are you guys already starting to see this ramp in your bookings or backlog for the second half or maybe even some of these already starting to fire here in the July quarter? And it seems like we're still in the very early innings of both of these upgrade cycles, but just wanted to get your views.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Harlan. No, I think we are - to start maybe at the end first. We're in the early innings of both these upgrade cycles. I think your commentary overall is right. Both of those are accelerating. On the PAM side, I would say probably by the end of '23, certainly if you draw a line between now and the end of - I'm sorry, calendar '22, our fiscal '23, you'll see most of this conversion from these legacy NRZ solutions move over. And that's still a decent amount of the connections today. So there's a big lift between now and then. That's pretty exciting. And then, of course, you've got other hyperscalers around the world outside the US. On 400 ZR, that is also just at the beginning phases. I think that's going to be much more broad, obviously, than COLORZ was, which was 100 gig, and it was really for one customer. And that is - both of those, we have strong backlog, bookings, visibility, heads down to plan the supply and to plan the ramp. So those are very much intact, which was really part of our deal thesis for doing it in the first place.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Rolland: Yes. Thanks for the question. Matt, you did mention the pause in spending - 5G spending, and you also did talk about China as well. But I was wondering if maybe we could talk about some of the other geographies, how they're ramping. And then, in terms of your 5G lead customers, how close do you think we are to a full run rate in terms of their ramps? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes. No, I think in general, the 5G momentum is quite strong. I think, obviously, you saw the impact on people last year with China, which was very meaningful. And that will, by the way, over time, we're debating, is it second half or when is it? But those deployments will obviously continue. They're not done. Then the U.S. is really, I think, where we're going to see a lot of traction this year. India is a little more unclear. I think the latest is, certainly, trials will be conducted at the end of this year. Candidly, I think, with impact of COVID-19 in the country that's probably delayed things. We saw that last year. If you remember, there was supposed to be a much larger U.S. build-out and COVID delayed that. We're watching that. But no, I think, overall, it's been a very meaningful technology transition. And so, we were - we think that's going to be very broad. We've still got a ways to go, to be honest with you. There's a lot in front of us relative to getting to full run rate with the full platform at our two lead OEMs. In one case, we have the platform, but they're really ramping their business based on their geographies that they participate in. And then with our second customer, those chips are still - a lot of those are in development, although our first products are ramping very nicely, and we're pleased to see that both those companies are participating very actively in the global 5G rollouts. So that was all positive. And, yes - and then, by the way, I mean, even with China stays flat, as I mentioned, it's - we do see a very strong second half for our 5G business. And we just came off our seventh quarter in a row of growing that business sequentially. So it's been a real tailwind for us. I did want to just make one comment before we move to the next question. I actually misspoke earlier, there was a question about fiber channel. And I think it was Ross, about it being lumpy. So I had my quarters off. So it was down - fiber channel was down in Q1. That was part of the lumpy down. It's going to be up in Q2, and then we anticipate it - unless there's some other disruptions, that should be a generally flat business going forward. And obviously, in the scheme of things in the combined company, I don't - and reported by end market, I don't anticipate we're going to be having lots of discussions about fiber channel anymore. But if something happens, we'll let you guys know.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nGary Mobley: On the topic of COVID spreading in different geographies, I guess we get a little tick-up in Taiwan. I'm wondering if you can share with us based on your conversations with your supply chain, whether or not you're possibly facing any production interruptions out of that region. And then, Jean, given the different moving parts in the OpEx, the 5% growth as you articulated over the long-term and then the leaving in at the $125 million of synergies, when would you expect the quarterly OpEx to bottom, whether in absolute terms or relative terms that $372.5 million Q2 guide? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Gary, I'll take the first one. I think it's - I think you're just highlighting a very important reminder for everybody on this call, who I believe probably everybody here is calling in from the United States, where things are opening up and things are feeling like they're getting back to normal. And as you point out, we're monitoring very closely the situation, not only in Taiwan. Obviously, we don't have production in India, but many chip companies have significant India operations in terms of R&D. You've got other countries in Southeast Asia that are having outbreaks. Malaysia would be one. So we're watching this very, very closely. It's been just an unprecedented year between weather and the virus on the supply chain. But we're watching it, and that's - we've comprehended as much as we could on any of these things into our guidance. We do that every quarter. But certainly, it's a dynamic situation. I mean we had a water issue in Taiwan recently. I guess, with the recent improvement there, some of that's backed off. So yes, it's something we've got to watch and manage very dynamically, Gary, but we've comprehended all of that in our outlook. Jean, do you want to answer the second question?\nJean Hu: Yes. Okay. Gary, on the OpEx side, given the opportunities and the revenue momentum we have been seeing in front of us, we definitely want to continue to invest. The 5% increase for next year really, it's incorporated the Marvell side for regular increase, we typically at the 2% to 3%. But on the Inphi side, there are tremendous opportunities, so the R&D investment is higher. So we are looking maybe just the next year. And on the synergy side, we talk about the $100 million OpEx synergy achievement. The way to think about it is exiting fiscal 2022, we should be able to achieve 50% of that $100 million run rate synergy. And then as you know, Q1 always seasonally OpEx is a little bit higher because of payroll increase in Q1 than Q2, Q3, by the Q3 time, we should get to the OpEx to the run rate, which achieved the full synergy at the same time, contemplated the increase, offset the increase of the year-over-year. In the longer-term, you should expect us to continue to focus on to grow revenue significantly faster than OpEx, so we can expand the earnings quickly.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nQuinn Bolton: Two for Matt. First, sort of near term, Matt, with supply, line of sight to supply increases in the second half of the year, have you been able to stabilize lead times to customers? And then my second question is kind of a longer-term with the ramp of 400-gig and 800-gig modules in the data center, that business potentially being even bigger than 5G for you, are you starting to get questions from customers about Marvell developing its own internal switch fabric? Or are customers happy for you to partner on SerDes and optical co-packaging and other opportunities without owning the switch fiber?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, great. Thanks, Quinn. Yes, on the first one, yes, certainly, we have, as I mentioned, line of sight on our supply through the end of the year and encouraged by what we're seeing also for next year as well. Look, lead times are very extended for everybody at this point. We\u2019ve asked our customers for significant backlog to - and not only the backlog, but really the detailed discussion behind the backlog relative to what are the drivers, how much of it is for buffer, or how much do you have now, what are your plans, so we can get better line of sight to allocate the material. And we've also worked with many of them and are in the process of doing that to really firm up those orders relative to their ability to reschedule and cancel them, but we're giving them time to figure that out. So I think that's been a healthy exercise, but lead times are not coming down. They're extended, not because we want to keep them extended, but the supply chain given the - just the volume on it, there's just queues and you just have to make sure you plan for that. And then on the data center side, we certainly have many of the key pieces, if not almost all the key pieces to really be a big player in the cloud infrastructure side with our ASICs, with the PAM products you mentioned, I mean, O-RAN, all kinds of things. On the switch side, it's an interesting discussion because we're very aggressively promoting and developing a co-packaged optics solution that will be very much open source for the industry. So we want to be an enabler of that. We think that's going to be a good thing, whether somebody wants to do their own ASIC or co-package it with a partner. And that's a discussion that we're having. I think we're encouraged because when you look at our - and I noted in my comments, we introduced about 18 months ago, our multi-terabit Switch family, where just as - for a reminder, these are at 3.2, 6.4 and 12.8 terabits per second. It's a modular design architecture. Now it's fully featured, which has its advantages in many applications, because that's really what customers want. On the other hand, there's a lot of optimization you can do if you really want to do a high-end switch for just speeds and feeds. And I think everything is on the table in terms of looking at all that in the context of Inphi coming in, in particular. And those are just some very active discussions we're having. But the roadmap, notwithstanding, we're extremely pleased with this high-end platform that we announced, it's done really well in the market, revenues ramping significantly, and it's going to have a very good year, next year and beyond. So I think that was a good investment that we made. And that really positioned us, Quinn, as a full provider from SMB switches to enterprise and campus, which is core in aggregation, all the way into the fully featured data center type applications. So it would be logical for us to consider broadening the portfolio there.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with SMBC Nikko. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: That's SMBC Nikko. Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a clarification question. Matt, first, on the outlook for the networking segment, if my math is correct here, I think you're guiding Inphi to be up at least mid-teens sequentially. And your core networking business, you said it's going to be up slightly. So I'm just trying to understand, is the difference primarily on the supply side? Or is it the demand, if you can clarify that? And then my second question, more of a longer-term question. You mentioned ARM servers and obviously, you've been the leader in that market for a long time. And there's been a lot of buzz, as you mentioned lately, and some of your peers are also announcing design wins. So my question is, when can we expect to hear from Marvell in terms of the design wins and revenue contribution from that market?\nJean Hu: Srini, maybe I'll answer your first question on the Inphi guide, right? So what we guide for Q2 combined company Inphi revenue, we said, is about $215 million. So in Q1, we only had $22 million of Inphi business. So you really cannot compare sequentially year-over-year, if you look at $215 million Inphi revenue, it means almost 24% year-over-year increase. On the Marvell side, I would say we guided basically, as Matt has said earlier, slightly up sequentially for the Marvell networking. So if you add Marvell networking plus Inphi's $215 million, that's what our guide for Q2 networking business. I'll let Matt answer the - your second question.\nMatt Murphy: Yes, that's right, Jean. And I mean I think the bigger picture, Srini, on the first one is just the blend of these two businesses are growing around 20% a year on networking kind of plus, right. So it's a very strong performance. And I noted the issues earlier on our side. On ARM, it really is a trend that's been happening. We certainly have a lot of capability in this area. There's a lot of confidentiality around this market. I can't really comment on us or the other people because I think it's also a little dangerous at times to talk about things. Is it a development type of opportunity? Is it a real production thing? So I think we - and our pivot and our business model last year was really to move this business from being one where in a lot of ways, our Thunder product line really was a prototype type of capability that we enabled the whole industry on. But in the end, what we found is nobody actually wanted to buy the standard products. So we're very pleased with the pivot we made. We have - we believe, the best set of IP true ability to stitch together these very large, high-end complex processors. I mean if you think about the things that we're doing for 5G or for networking or even what we built on Thunder, we have a second to none capability there. And you should just assume that we're very active in this market, but in a different kind of a business model where we engage directly with these customers, there's an NRE type of arrangement. We build them exactly what they want. And the use cases and the benefits of moving to ARM are significant. And I think publicly, it's out there, the instances that are being moved more and more with an AWS platform to Graviton, which is their own, we obviously don't participate in that, but it's just a great proof point for the industry. It's real and it's happening, ARM and infrastructure, and we're - our view is we would be the leading company for anyone to talk to about not only be able to design the chip and productize it, but then to supply it in the kind of volumes that's required. It's - that's a key part of the equation now.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nChris Caso: Just some clarification regarding the additional supply. And with that additional supply coming on, at what point do you expect to be back at the level where you're shipping all your customers' orders? Do you think you get there by the end of the second half? Or is that going to take longer? Just following on from that, we've heard from a lot of others, obviously, with the tight supply conditions order visibilities stretching out customers or placing orders for in advance. It sounds like from your prior comments that you're not forcing those customer orders to be non-cancelable at this point. Maybe just clarify that a little more and talk about what additional visibility that gives you going forward?\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes, Chris. Thanks for the question. As I noted earlier, we've been growing this company double-digits since a year ago, and it's only accelerating. And as we've done that, that's been great, but candidly, we haven't made a real dent in the delinquency. And in fact, I think our business momentum is growing, but I think the demands on us are growing even faster than our supply. So, we're working hard on it. But I would say anybody that tells you in this industry that they know when this is going to get better, like, hey, it's going to happen in a quarter. It's going to - I don't think that you're probably getting a realistic answer is my view. I think it's very dynamic. It's unprecedented. And at this point, there are so many industries that are up and to the right and everybody is clamoring for product that - but we're working on it. And like I said, we're the type of company, Chris, that I think we're more focused on the long-term, slow and steady, keep cranking it out every quarter, keep blocking and tackling through this time period and keep making sure our customer are up. And then on your second question, no, we are ensuring that we have protection and not only protection, but I would say mutual commitment with our customers around the supply. So, we do have a large portion of our backlog, which is only getting more, to be honest, that is non-cancelable. We are being somewhat flexible around building in some reschedule capability. Maybe you can do it once. And we're trying to work with our customers on this, but we're having to make commitments, especially with the growth that we see in front of us, which I'm very comfortable doing, but I also want to have the backstop of my customers. And this environment has created a dynamic where pretty much the CEO level at all of our major accounts, they're willing to engage in this type of discussion, activate their materials teams and get everybody together so that we can plan this thing as a combined team, a Marvell team and a customer team versus two independent entities doing their own thing and the era of customers being secretive about their volumes or hiding the ball or not one you're doing just in time, that's kind of all out the window at this point. And so the visibility is pretty good that we're getting, but we are ensuring that we - when we're making commitments, we've got some backstop from the customers that want the product.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nHarsh Kumar: First of all, congratulation on solid results and also being so clear about all the numbers. It really helps us out. I had a question, Matt. I was wondering if you could break down your networking business. Let's say, just even for core Marvell organically, the split or rough color between 5G, cloud and enterprise and also if Nokia is - is it running at ramp? Or has it got still room to run from here?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Well, Harsh, all of your wishes are going to come true next quarter because we're going to break out for you in detail the data center business of Marvell, which is going to have the cloud in it. We're going to break up the carrier, which you'll be able - we'll build it. And we'll talk to all of these, by the way, right? So you'll be able to get a sense of the moving pieces of 5G. We're going to have an auto industrial, which is - obviously, the big growth there is going to come from the automotive. And then our enterprise networking, which I think is a great proxy as well. So I think we're going to give you what you want, and we're going to give you seven quarters of history, and we're going to guide it. Okay. So you'll be like a kid in a candy store. And then on the second question on Nokia, yes, that's still ramping. You've heard their commentary. They're ramping up. We're kind of replacing their legacy solutions within their - they have their recharge portfolio. We're part of that. They talk openly about sort of replacing FPGAs with recharge. So we're just part of that growth. And then, of course, we've got future opportunities where we're going to intersect with them with new sockets over time. So that's still in a ramp phase though. It's still early.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the question-and-answer session, also concluding today's call. We'd like to thank you for attending today's presentation. And at this time, you may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Murphy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our first quarter GAAP results for the combined company. Revenue for the combined company was $832 million. GAAP gross margin was 50.2% and loss per diluted share was $0.13. I'm now going to review standalone Marvell non-GAAP results, excluding those of Inphi. We began fiscal 2022 on a strong note, delivering solid results in the first quarter, driven by the strength of our core businesses and continued operational excellence. Marvell standalone revenue for the first quarter was $810 million, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Revenue grew 17% year-on-year, driven by robust growth in both our networking and storage businesses. Higher revenue, coupled with stronger gross margin and lower operating expenses, drove non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.02 above the midpoint of guidance to $0.29. Non-GAAP EPS grew 61% year-on-year, demonstrating the significant operating leverage in our business model. I'm pleased that Marvell delivered the fourth straight quarter of double-digit year-on-year revenue growth, despite industry-wide supply constraints that have tightened considerably over the same time period. In fact, our year-on-year growth rate accelerated in the first quarter on strong and growing demand across all our end markets, and I'm pleased that our operations team rose to the challenge in a difficult environment. But we have more work to do. Majority of our products are proprietary and sole-sourced and demand for our solutions continues to grow. We need to support our customers with a flexible supply chain capable of delivering to upside demand within a reasonable lead time, something that has not been feasible this year. To further improve our supply, Chris Koopmans, who has played an instrumental role in Marvell's ongoing transformation, has been appointed as our Chief Operations Officer to lead our global operations and supply chain organization, in addition to his current role leading marketing and business operations. Chris is leveraging his deep understanding of our markets and customers to prioritize and align supply to our key growth initiatives. We are extending our planning horizons, strengthening strategic supplier partnerships and using our balance sheet where appropriate, to build more flexibility. Our suppliers value Marvell's focus on data infrastructure as a source of sustainable growth, driven by favorable secular trends compared to other cyclical end markets. And as a result, they are excited to partner with us. Looking to the second half of this fiscal year, we are confident that we have secured sufficient supply to enable accelerating year-on-year revenue growth for standalone Marvell, above that of the first half. We expect supply to further improve next fiscal year. In a few moments, I'll discuss Inphi's business, where we also expect strong revenue growth throughout the year. Moving on to our merger with Inphi and related organizational changes. We received regulatory approval to merge with Inphi in April, earlier than originally anticipated and began integrating the talented Inphi team. We have emerged from this transaction as a U.S. Corporation, which we believe better positions the combined company for long-term success. Reflecting the larger scale and broader scope of Marvell, several key Inphi executives have joined my direct staff. Loi Nguyen and Nariman Yousefi will manage the Inphi businesses and have also increased their scope to include additional Marvell businesses. Lawrence Tse, Inphi's central engineering leader, will manage Marvell's analog and mixed signal organization. In addition, Raghib Hussain has taken on a broader elevated role as President, Products and Technologies, to drive strategy alignment and growth across the company. Similar to our prior acquisitions, we expect the infusion of Inphi talent will add scale and further strengthen the capabilities of the combined company. We have built a world-class management team with deep technical expertise, vast industry experience and a proven track record in driving growth and value creation. Let me move on now to discussing our two businesses in more detail. Networking. First, for Marvell standalone networking, revenue grew during the first - revenue during the first quarter was $476 million, consistent with our outlook for strong growth. On a sequential basis, revenue grew 9%, underpinned by growth in all key product lines with the exception of 5G ASICs. However, overall 5G revenue continued to grow, marking our seventh straight consecutive quarter of growth. Year-on-year growth was a very robust 21% in networking, with solid contributions from multiple end markets. In 5G, growth was driven by standard and semi-custom product shipments to Samsung and Nokia, partially offset by a decline in ASICs as deployments in China paused. In cloud networking, we continue to benefit from strong customer demand for our SmartNIC DPUs. In automotive, we are growing rapidly with our Ethernet product shipping into multiple model year 2021 vehicles. Our Enterprise Networking business also delivered solid results, extending the double-digit growth trend established last year, despite a soft end market. This performance is a result of our expanding market position, driven by our refreshed Ethernet switches and multi-gigabit PHYs. To the extent, the enterprise spending recovers later this year, that would be another tailwind to our business. Not only are we winning and ramping in the access, aggregation and core switching markets, we are also making inroads in the data center with our feature-rich and scalable multi-terabit family of switches. As a reminder, these products leverage a modular architecture to deliver multiple capacity points, from 3.2 terabits per second to 12.8 terabits for a broad range of data center applications. We have been winning new sockets and expect these design wins to start contributing meaningfully higher levels of revenue next fiscal year. Let me now discuss the outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2022 for our Networking business. This outlook includes revenue from Inphi's complete electro-optics platform comprised of their industry-leading PAM and coherent DSPs, high-performance broadband analog drivers and TIAs, highly integrated silicon photonics and data center interconnect modules. For the second quarter, we anticipate networking revenue to grow just over 70% year-on-year. Let me walk you through the growth expectations from the Marvell and Inphi businesses implicit in this guidance. We expect Marvell's standalone networking to drive strong year-on-year revenue growth in the high teens on a percentage basis and be up slightly on a sequential basis. Similar to the prior quarter, we expect broad growth from multiple products, offset by a pause in China 5G. This outlook reflects ongoing supply constraints, which have more - been more acute for our networking products. However, as I discussed earlier, we believe we have line of sight to supply improvements later this year and next year to support our growth plans. As we look forward, we expect a strong second half ramp compared to the first half in standalone Marvell's networking business, including an acceleration in our 5G business from both our own product ramps and an increase in 5G adoption in the U.S. and other regions. From the acquired Inphi business, we expect approximately $215 million in revenue in our second fiscal quarter. I am very pleased that at this level of revenue, we expect the Inphi business will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings in the first full quarter as a combined company. We expect this business to drive strong growth above Marvell's growth rate, benefiting from the demand for high-speed connectivity inside and between data centers and in the carrier market. Let me briefly discuss Inphi's data center growth drivers. Inside data centers, as demand for bandwidth continues to increase, a generational shift is underway from traditional NRZ signaling to more advanced Pulse Amplitude Modulation, or PAM, which enables a significant increase in bandwidth. This is one of the biggest changes in data center connectivity, and Inphi is leading this industry transition. Inphi is the largest provider of PAM4 DSPs to the optical connectivity market, having shipped millions of devices. As the market continues to transition to higher speeds, 400-gig adoption has been accelerating. And last year, we started sampling our next-generation 800-gig solution, which is seeing strong traction with customers. In collaboration with Microsoft, Inphi pioneered pluggable transceiver technology to directly interconnect regional cloud data centers at lower cost, complexity and power compared to traditional optical transport solutions. The first product, COLORZ use PAM4 technology to enable 100-gig per wavelength, which could be multiplexed to support up to 4 terabits per second of bandwidth over a single fiber for data center interconnect or DCI applications. This product has been shipping in volume and established Inphi's leadership in this category. Building on the success of COLORZ, which was deployed primarily by one hyperscaler last year, Inphi introduced COLORZ II, the industry's first pluggable transceiver compatible with the 400ZR industry standard, which enables 400-gig per wavelength using coherent technology. We expect to maintain our leadership position in the DCI market and project that COLORZ II deployments will start this year. With an industry standard now in place, we see multiple hyperscalers and additional customers adopting pluggable ZR technology, which creates a significantly larger revenue opportunity for our DCI platform. Turning now to our storage business. Storage revenue for the first quarter was $303 million, growing 17% year-on-year and declining 7% sequentially. Results were better than our expectations as we benefited from stronger demand for SSD controllers. The stellar year-on-year results were driven by ramps in our custom DIY SSD controller programs and ongoing growth in cloud demand for nearline drives, which benefited from - benefited our HDD controllers and pre-amplifiers. The sequential decline was primarily due to our Fiber Channel business. Looking to the second quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect storage to deliver another strong performance driven by the nearline HDD and data center SSD markets. We are projecting revenue to grow year-on-year in the mid-teens and in the double-digits sequentially on a percentage basis. Our recent results and expectations for ongoing growth reflect the significant transformation of our storage business. In our HDD business, data center has become the largest revenue contributor relative to other markets. Our preamplifier business is now ramped up to an annualized run rate of over $50 million, and we believe that we can more than double this run rate. We are continuing to step up the technology cadence for our SSD controllers, and we recently introduced the industry's first PCIe Gen5 SSD controller family designed to address the data movement and security challenges in cloud infrastructure. We are excited to collaborate directly with hyperscalers and NAND vendors to bring this leading solution to market. In addition, I'm pleased to announce that a key NAND OEM has chosen to partner with Marvell to develop custom PCIe Gen5 and Gen6 SSD controllers for their enterprise and cloud solutions. The Gen6 product will be built on our 5-nanometer process. In the storage market, this is a quantum leap and process node cadence and is a testament to Marvell's advanced technology platform. We expect to leverage the leading-edge IP we are developing to be deployed in additional advanced node storage solutions. Our strategy to refocus this business on the data center market has been a huge success. Data center has grown to over 60% of storage revenue from less than 20% in fiscal 2017. In closing, we had a great start to fiscal 2022, and I'm very excited about the growth prospects in front of us as a combined company. When we announced the acquisition of Inphi, we increased our long-term target model for revenue growth to 12% to 16% annually. I'm pleased that our recent results and near-term expectations are, in fact, currently trending above the high end of this target range. This is primarily due to our own product cycles, combined with sustainable, secular growth trends in our data infrastructure markets. The acquisition of Inphi has increased our exposure to the data center, which is our largest end market. And within that, cloud is the largest growth opportunity across Marvell, significantly bigger than our 5G opportunity. Inphi has already established a strong position within cloud, addressing an opportunity growing at a 60% plus CAGR. The Marvell organic opportunity in cloud is also substantial, which we are addressing with our merchant, semi-custom and flexible ASIC model for compute, networking, acceleration, security and storage applications. At our Analyst Day last year, we discussed this opportunity growing at an expected 19% CAGR to over $5 billion by calendar 2023. The adoption of ARM processors and servers continues to gain traction, and this further increases our cloud opportunity. We expect cloud revenue for the combined company to grow rapidly. As Marvell's 5-nanometer products come to market, we expect a substantial step-up in our cloud revenue. I'm very pleased to report that we have been recently awarded a number of significant design wins, leveraging our advanced technology platform. Respecting customer confidentiality, we will not be in a position to discuss any specific win. They are with multiple customers across a variety of applications and business models. We expect these products to start ramping into production in calendar 2023, achieving peak revenue in the calendar 2024 to 2025 timeframe. As I approach my five-year anniversary at Marvell, I've never felt stronger about our growth prospects, and I'm grateful to all our employees who have worked hard to transform the company to position us for what we believe will be a very exciting future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Yes. Great, John. Thanks for the question. Yes, we're very happy with the results in networking. I mean, as you pointed out, that was a sequential number. So clearly, business has been very, very good for us in networking. And certainly, year-over-year, to do 20%-plus is great. The demand, John, continues in Q2 and beyond. We're continuing to work on improving the supply on our networking products. As it turns out, and as you've probably seen, the complexity on our networking business in terms of the manufacturing, cycle time supply chain is much more complex and challenging than on the storage side. So we've been able to meet some more of the upsides on storage than we have networking. But no, John, business continues to be strong. We do have line of sight to the supply improving in the second half, which is encouraging. And that's why we're continuing to be very bullish about the outlook for our overall networking business because the demand is clearly there, and we've now got supply coming online in the back half as well as into next year. So things are improving for sure. Sure, Vivek. Yes. I think, look, in this environment, in general, supply is coming in, not in large chunks. Although, I would say, given the ramp we had been planning for some time, in our case, we do see more significant amount of supply coming in, in the second half. So that will improve, and we have visibility of that, both on the wafer side as well as on the back-end side. And at the same time, as we ramp our supply position, as I mentioned to John, the demand side continues to outstrip our ability to supply at all, but we're making good progress there. On your second question, in both cases, both in enterprise as well as China 5G, those are not comprehended to have market-related comebacks in that time frame. On enterprise, as you've seen, I mean, we've been growing that business well above double-digit for some time, including in our Q1, and we do anticipate that to continue. Now that's mostly on the back of our own product cycles, okay? And we've been very successful, I think, in our enterprise and campus switching, also in our PHY business. And so that continues. So that's - and by the way, and what's been viewed as a very soft market, both by the OEMs as well as other semiconductor peers. So if that end market improves with return to work and vaccinations improving, that would be a pretty significant tailwind on our business. As it relates to 5G in China, maybe just to kind of frame it in the bigger picture, I think, first, our own team internally, I want to give them credit, they did a good job for - in the first half, telling us last year that the mapping out the digestion phase, which is what's happened, so that's actually been in line with our plan. And we're not necessarily counting on a big recovery in that in the second half. If it does, that would be great. But just to frame it, Vivek, in the bigger picture, our 5G business and exposure in China is actually less than 20% of our overall 5G business, both now and even going forward. And in fact, it probably slowly becomes a smaller percentage over time as our new OEMs ramp up and some of these other initiatives kick in. So again, either of those two came back very strong, that would also be a tailwind on our business. Yes, Tim, I'll take the first part and then we'll hand it to Jean. So yes, as you noted, historically, we've - just by practice, not tried to articulate or size revenue synergies when we announced the deal. It's just very hard to do. And quite frankly, it's very hard to even measure in the rearview mirror. But that being said, on all of these transactions we've done, we can look back and we can actually point to cases where one plus one was way over two. And it kind of comes in two pieces. The first is really what I would call the customer revenue synergy, Tim, which would be we have products that we can sell, for example, into 5G or the cloud and Inphi, in this case, would as well. And in those discussions, the notion that we can be a better supplier together really comes together. I mean if you remember back in the - after the Cavium transaction, I think that was very significant, what happened with - in 5G and with Samsung, where together, we were able to get effectively the whole platform, where a part we had actually very little content. So I do - I'm very encouraged by what we see. I think customers really like the combination to a person, and those are very strong. And I believe we will see cases we can point to. It's already underway. The second part of it is really more of a technical one, which is how do we actually incorporate the intellectual property of the two companies, put it together and deliver better solutions. Those discussions are also going well, in particular, with the Inphi, SerDes, IP as it relates to our ASIC business, our roadmap into co-packaged optics and our vision of optics everywhere and not just co-packaging and with the switch, but also in things like AI and ML ASICs and DPUs. So that's going to be a very critical piece of the puzzle as we enter these complex markets, and more and more the connectivity moves to electro-optic solution. So that, I think, Tim, is - we're very, very excited about all that. I think it's going to work out very well on both of those fronts, I mentioned. Let me hand it over to Jean to cover the second question. Yes. Great question, Blayne, on storage. So, a couple of things. So on the SSD side, yes, that's actually multiple DIY programs now. Those are kicking in, in various end markets, and we see that trend being obviously way up year-over-year this year, but growing strongly into next year. So I think that strategy to really work closely with some of these system-level OEMs, whether it'd be in the cloud or other applications. It's a pretty compelling business model. So, that one is going well. On the cloud or on the nearline side, yes, I mean, I think if you just look at the performance of these large cloud properties and how they're performing in terms of their own revenue growth. There's certainly a scaling that goes on with the storage. So, the need for increase capacity in cold storage continues. We're well-positioned with that with our controllers and our preamplifiers, actually which is a new revenue stream for us as well. So that's still continuing and that's very strong. And then finally, the fiber channel, it was one of our most stable businesses, Blayne going back even when Cavium owned it, even when it was QLogic. It certainly have a lot of choppiness this year with manufacturing supply disruptions in Southeast Asia. That's started to stabilize. Actually, fiber channel grew quarter-over-quarter and will continue to get better. And we hope that, that will - just by design that should be a much more stable business. So yes, overall, just I think you've heard in my remarks, I mean, we're just - it's been a journey on the storage side, and I've just got to thank our entire team for fundamentally transforming a business, which, if you go back 5 years ago when I showed up, and this wasn't just me, the whole management team, this was a business that was highly concentrated, HDD controllers only, selling all into 2.5-inch notebooks, okay? And that was sort of the story and the melting ice cube people were worried about. And so I'm very proud of the team when I fast forward 5 years, and we've now got greater than 60% of our storage business in data center and these high-performance applications and then really the bulk of the balance being in very sticky, stable markets. And the exposure to things like notebooks being deminimis, I think it's been a great transformation story. And the fact that we're having calls talking about our storage business growing double digits and continuing to do that is great effort. And by the way, we're not milking this business either. I mean, we've been very aggressive to move our platform to 5-nanometer, which effectively jumped at least a node for most people, probably for most people with 2 or 3 nodes. But for these high-performance applications, Blayne, especially in the data center, you get tremendous power savings by doing this. So that's going to be a first step into a broader platform of products in storage as well as in our traditional networking businesses like processors and switch chips. Yes. Great questions. So just quickly on the first one. Actually, we're - I'm pretty excited about moving to the end market reporting. I think it's going to give investors a much growth drivers. It actually reflects how we think about allocating the capital of the company. I mean I've actually managed the company from a market-based philosophy from the very beginning. And so to now be able to show you our data center business, there's also peers that report those numbers, so it will give investors a sense of our relative growth rates. And then carrier, you can capture our 5G anyway. So I think that will be a real positive thing for everybody. On the networking side, it's interesting, Ross, that individually, some of these businesses are inherently lumpy. I mean I think we all know that the carrier telecom-type businesses tend to be lumpier than others. That being said, when you blend actually our combined networking businesses across things like enterprise and carrier and even right now, automotive is reported in our networking, actually, from an end demand standpoint, you do get a smoother profile, which has all been up into the right by the way. I think in the last year, the dynamic on the quarterly moves has been more supply related than it has been just, 'Hey, networking was up and then everybody kind of slowed down together and everybody is up. Actually, business has been very strong, Ross since last year. If you recall, we started growing the company double digits year-over-year in Q2 of last year. So we've been on this double-digit growth rate. Now we're - it's actually accelerating. And during this time frame, if we could get more supply, it would probably look a lot - look smoother, if you will. But I think you're right to integrate it over maybe a few quarter period, first half, second half or even one-year period to get the full view just because the manufacturing cycle times of some of these products can be several quarters. So if you get upside, there's a time to react. But no, if you just sort of blended end demand, Ross, you'd see a very steady increase. And the nice thing is we have a very diversified business in networking. So it's spread across all these end markets, as I mentioned. Sure, Ambrish. I mean, I would say both in the relative near term, okay, and over the next several years. I actually break it into three phases. There's the sort of second half of this year, looking into next year and the year after, and then I would say, out a few years beyond that. I think - and I didn't quite answer Ross' question, but I'll weave it in here. This last one was what do you see in the second half? So in networking, for example, I mean, we have the 5G ramp for us will pick up, will accelerate. That's primarily due to increased adoption in the United States and deployments there plus design wins that we have won several years ago ramping into production. You've got a very strong Marvell business in the cloud with our SmartNIC product line, that's been growing very, very nicely and will continue in the second half. I'm surprised no one asked the question about Inphi yet, but we're very pleased to guide 215 for Inphi in Q2, which is, I think, well above what anybody thought. That business is also going to continue to accelerate in the second half, both on the intra-data center business in PAM4 as well as the 400ZR ramp, which we think will be meaningful next year, but also starting this year. And then finally, as I mentioned, the Ethernet switch and PHY business, you could also throw automotive in there. I mean, we got almost all of these growth drivers we mentioned continue. So that's right in front of us. I think what I get very excited about, as you alluded to, is the design win momentum in the company has been extremely strong. And probably - not probably, as strong as I've ever seen it in the past five years I've been here and any kind of prior record I could find. And those are things that, as we noted in my remarks, would be designs we win now that would ramp up starting probably in calendar 2023, 2024 and then go beyond that and that's also you would - you should kind of tie it together with that was when our 5-nanometer platform will be really in full production across multiple end customers, end markets and end applications. So that's one that kind of layers on top of all of this and candidly, would extend beyond what we talked about at the last Investor Day. So I think if you draw a line between here and there, there's all kinds of goodness in different areas, Ambrish, but I think we're feeling really good about the investments we made. I think the acquisitions that we did positioned us really well and they fit together in their own way. And I think - and finally, I would say that the customer go-to-market, our brand promise to our customers, the way we engage, the way we partner, resonates really well in this environment. And we're just - we're viewed as a very credible and reliable partner with scale now, especially with Inphi and to really deliver the most complex critical products that our customers need. Yes. This is just Marvell, standalone. So all those comments on largest sort of design type win achievement we've seen plus the funnel, that's all from the organic Marvell business, okay? Starting next quarter, we're going to have the Inphi team in our results and in our internal results in terms of our design win funnel and momentum. But yes, they've done a great job, too. I mean that's the whole other story. But I'm just saying standalone Marvell with our 5-nanometer platform and our 5G cloud strategy, automotive, all the things we articulated at the Investor Day, pre-Inphi, that's all tracking the in line or better than we thought. Yes. Thanks, Harlan. No, I think we are - to start maybe at the end first. We're in the early innings of both these upgrade cycles. I think your commentary overall is right. Both of those are accelerating. On the PAM side, I would say probably by the end of '23, certainly if you draw a line between now and the end of - I'm sorry, calendar '22, our fiscal '23, you'll see most of this conversion from these legacy NRZ solutions move over. And that's still a decent amount of the connections today. So there's a big lift between now and then. That's pretty exciting. And then, of course, you've got other hyperscalers around the world outside the US. On 400 ZR, that is also just at the beginning phases. I think that's going to be much more broad, obviously, than COLORZ was, which was 100 gig, and it was really for one customer. And that is - both of those, we have strong backlog, bookings, visibility, heads down to plan the supply and to plan the ramp. So those are very much intact, which was really part of our deal thesis for doing it in the first place. Sure. Yes. No, I think in general, the 5G momentum is quite strong. I think, obviously, you saw the impact on people last year with China, which was very meaningful. And that will, by the way, over time, we're debating, is it second half or when is it? But those deployments will obviously continue. They're not done. Then the U.S. is really, I think, where we're going to see a lot of traction this year. India is a little more unclear. I think the latest is, certainly, trials will be conducted at the end of this year. Candidly, I think, with impact of COVID-19 in the country that's probably delayed things. We saw that last year. If you remember, there was supposed to be a much larger U.S. build-out and COVID delayed that. We're watching that. But no, I think, overall, it's been a very meaningful technology transition. And so, we were - we think that's going to be very broad. We've still got a ways to go, to be honest with you. There's a lot in front of us relative to getting to full run rate with the full platform at our two lead OEMs. In one case, we have the platform, but they're really ramping their business based on their geographies that they participate in. And then with our second customer, those chips are still - a lot of those are in development, although our first products are ramping very nicely, and we're pleased to see that both those companies are participating very actively in the global 5G rollouts. So that was all positive. And, yes - and then, by the way, I mean, even with China stays flat, as I mentioned, it's - we do see a very strong second half for our 5G business. And we just came off our seventh quarter in a row of growing that business sequentially. So it's been a real tailwind for us. I did want to just make one comment before we move to the next question. I actually misspoke earlier, there was a question about fiber channel. And I think it was Ross, about it being lumpy. So I had my quarters off. So it was down - fiber channel was down in Q1. That was part of the lumpy down. It's going to be up in Q2, and then we anticipate it - unless there's some other disruptions, that should be a generally flat business going forward. And obviously, in the scheme of things in the combined company, I don't - and reported by end market, I don't anticipate we're going to be having lots of discussions about fiber channel anymore. But if something happens, we'll let you guys know. Yes. Gary, I'll take the first one. I think it's - I think you're just highlighting a very important reminder for everybody on this call, who I believe probably everybody here is calling in from the United States, where things are opening up and things are feeling like they're getting back to normal. And as you point out, we're monitoring very closely the situation, not only in Taiwan. Obviously, we don't have production in India, but many chip companies have significant India operations in terms of R&D. You've got other countries in Southeast Asia that are having outbreaks. Malaysia would be one. So we're watching this very, very closely. It's been just an unprecedented year between weather and the virus on the supply chain. But we're watching it, and that's - we've comprehended as much as we could on any of these things into our guidance. We do that every quarter. But certainly, it's a dynamic situation. I mean we had a water issue in Taiwan recently. I guess, with the recent improvement there, some of that's backed off. So yes, it's something we've got to watch and manage very dynamically, Gary, but we've comprehended all of that in our outlook. Jean, do you want to answer the second question? Yes, great. Thanks, Quinn. Yes, on the first one, yes, certainly, we have, as I mentioned, line of sight on our supply through the end of the year and encouraged by what we're seeing also for next year as well. Look, lead times are very extended for everybody at this point. We've asked our customers for significant backlog to - and not only the backlog, but really the detailed discussion behind the backlog relative to what are the drivers, how much of it is for buffer, or how much do you have now, what are your plans, so we can get better line of sight to allocate the material. And we've also worked with many of them and are in the process of doing that to really firm up those orders relative to their ability to reschedule and cancel them, but we're giving them time to figure that out. So I think that's been a healthy exercise, but lead times are not coming down. They're extended, not because we want to keep them extended, but the supply chain given the - just the volume on it, there's just queues and you just have to make sure you plan for that. And then on the data center side, we certainly have many of the key pieces, if not almost all the key pieces to really be a big player in the cloud infrastructure side with our ASICs, with the PAM products you mentioned, I mean, O-RAN, all kinds of things. On the switch side, it's an interesting discussion because we're very aggressively promoting and developing a co-packaged optics solution that will be very much open source for the industry. So we want to be an enabler of that. We think that's going to be a good thing, whether somebody wants to do their own ASIC or co-package it with a partner. And that's a discussion that we're having. I think we're encouraged because when you look at our - and I noted in my comments, we introduced about 18 months ago, our multi-terabit Switch family, where just as - for a reminder, these are at 3.2, 6.4 and 12.8 terabits per second. It's a modular design architecture. Now it's fully featured, which has its advantages in many applications, because that's really what customers want. On the other hand, there's a lot of optimization you can do if you really want to do a high-end switch for just speeds and feeds. And I think everything is on the table in terms of looking at all that in the context of Inphi coming in, in particular. And those are just some very active discussions we're having. But the roadmap, notwithstanding, we're extremely pleased with this high-end platform that we announced, it's done really well in the market, revenues ramping significantly, and it's going to have a very good year, next year and beyond. So I think that was a good investment that we made. And that really positioned us, Quinn, as a full provider from SMB switches to enterprise and campus, which is core in aggregation, all the way into the fully featured data center type applications. So it would be logical for us to consider broadening the portfolio there. Yes, that's right, Jean. And I mean I think the bigger picture, Srini, on the first one is just the blend of these two businesses are growing around 20% a year on networking kind of plus, right. So it's a very strong performance. And I noted the issues earlier on our side. On ARM, it really is a trend that's been happening. We certainly have a lot of capability in this area. There's a lot of confidentiality around this market. I can't really comment on us or the other people because I think it's also a little dangerous at times to talk about things. Is it a development type of opportunity? Is it a real production thing? So I think we - and our pivot and our business model last year was really to move this business from being one where in a lot of ways, our Thunder product line really was a prototype type of capability that we enabled the whole industry on. But in the end, what we found is nobody actually wanted to buy the standard products. So we're very pleased with the pivot we made. We have - we believe, the best set of IP true ability to stitch together these very large, high-end complex processors. I mean if you think about the things that we're doing for 5G or for networking or even what we built on Thunder, we have a second to none capability there. And you should just assume that we're very active in this market, but in a different kind of a business model where we engage directly with these customers, there's an NRE type of arrangement. We build them exactly what they want. And the use cases and the benefits of moving to ARM are significant. And I think publicly, it's out there, the instances that are being moved more and more with an AWS platform to Graviton, which is their own, we obviously don't participate in that, but it's just a great proof point for the industry. It's real and it's happening, ARM and infrastructure, and we're - our view is we would be the leading company for anyone to talk to about not only be able to design the chip and productize it, but then to supply it in the kind of volumes that's required. It's - that's a key part of the equation now. Sure. Yes, Chris. Thanks for the question. As I noted earlier, we've been growing this company double-digits since a year ago, and it's only accelerating. And as we've done that, that's been great, but candidly, we haven't made a real dent in the delinquency. And in fact, I think our business momentum is growing, but I think the demands on us are growing even faster than our supply. So, we're working hard on it. But I would say anybody that tells you in this industry that they know when this is going to get better, like, hey, it's going to happen in a quarter. It's going to - I don't think that you're probably getting a realistic answer is my view. I think it's very dynamic. It's unprecedented. And at this point, there are so many industries that are up and to the right and everybody is clamoring for product that - but we're working on it. And like I said, we're the type of company, Chris, that I think we're more focused on the long-term, slow and steady, keep cranking it out every quarter, keep blocking and tackling through this time period and keep making sure our customer are up. And then on your second question, no, we are ensuring that we have protection and not only protection, but I would say mutual commitment with our customers around the supply. So, we do have a large portion of our backlog, which is only getting more, to be honest, that is non-cancelable. We are being somewhat flexible around building in some reschedule capability. Maybe you can do it once. And we're trying to work with our customers on this, but we're having to make commitments, especially with the growth that we see in front of us, which I'm very comfortable doing, but I also want to have the backstop of my customers. And this environment has created a dynamic where pretty much the CEO level at all of our major accounts, they're willing to engage in this type of discussion, activate their materials teams and get everybody together so that we can plan this thing as a combined team, a Marvell team and a customer team versus two independent entities doing their own thing and the era of customers being secretive about their volumes or hiding the ball or not one you're doing just in time, that's kind of all out the window at this point. And so the visibility is pretty good that we're getting, but we are ensuring that we - when we're making commitments, we've got some backstop from the customers that want the product. Yes. Well, Harsh, all of your wishes are going to come true next quarter because we're going to break out for you in detail the data center business of Marvell, which is going to have the cloud in it. We're going to break up the carrier, which you'll be able - we'll build it. And we'll talk to all of these, by the way, right? So you'll be able to get a sense of the moving pieces of 5G. We're going to have an auto industrial, which is - obviously, the big growth there is going to come from the automotive. And then our enterprise networking, which I think is a great proxy as well. So I think we're going to give you what you want, and we're going to give you seven quarters of history, and we're going to guide it. Okay. So you'll be like a kid in a candy store. And then on the second question on Nokia, yes, that's still ramping. You've heard their commentary. They're ramping up. We're kind of replacing their legacy solutions within their - they have their recharge portfolio. We're part of that. They talk openly about sort of replacing FPGAs with recharge. So we're just part of that growth. And then, of course, we've got future opportunities where we're going to intersect with them with new sockets over time. So that's still in a ramp phase though. It's still early."

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt. Good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with our GAAP results for the first quarter for the combined company, followed by Marvell's standalone non-GAAP performance and conclude with our outlook. Please note, our GAAP financials include 10 days of results from the Inphi business and the impact of purchase price comping items, share-based compensation expenses, amortization of acquired intangible assets, vehicle segment and acquisition related costs. Revenue was $832 million. GAAP gross margin was 50.2%. GAAP operating expenses were $500 million. GAAP operating loss was $82 million. GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.13. Turning to the balance sheet. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $538 million, which include the impact of setting up Inphi's inventory by $187 million due to purchase price accounting. We amortized the $40 million of this step-up into cost of goods sold in the first quarter, and we anticipate amortizing the remaining balance by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2022. During the quarter, we paid $140 million in cash for fees related to the Inphi transaction. Excluding those one-time payments, our cash flow generation from operations would have been $100 million. As a reminder, our cash flow generation has seasonality and tend to be lower in our first fiscal quarter due to the payment for annual cash bonus to employees. In the first quarter, we distributed $41 million to shareholders in dividends. We accept the quarter with $523 million in cash and short-term investments. Our long-term debt was $4.7 billion and currently carries the blended interest rate of approximately 2.5%. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.9, and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.4, based on combined pro forma EBITDA. We continue to have a strong investment-grade credit profile. Our capital allocation priorities over the next 12 months are to maintain our current dividend level, and utilize our free cash flow to pay down debt used for the acquisition for Inphi. We believe we can drive strong revenue growth and free cash flow generation to quickly achieve our target ratio of 2 times gross debt-to-EBITDA. I'll now move on to standalone Marvell non-GAAP results. As Ashish had noted earlier, we are providing standalone Marvell results on a onetime basis this quarter because our previously provided financial outlook for the first quarter excluded any impact of the Inphi acquisition. Reconciliation of our standalone and combined performance as well as GAAP to non-GAAP results available in our press release. Standalone Marvell revenue in the first quarter was $810 million, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Networking represented 60% of our revenue with storage contributing 36%. Revenue from other accounted for 4%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64.3%, above our guidance and the 150-basis point improvement from a year ago, primarily due to better product mix and our team's continued effort to drive operational excellence. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $297 million as we continue to tightly manage our expenses while investing for growth. Non-GAAP operating margin was 27.7%, an 810-basis point increase from a year ago, demonstrating the strong operating leverage in our business model. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $0.29, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance range by $0.02 and is up more than 60% year-over-year. Let me now comment on our plan for operating expenses going forward. After closing the Inphi acquisition, the starting pro forma operating expense trend rate for the combined company was approximately $375 million per quarter. We expect our operating expenses to grow annually in the range of 4% to 5% as we continue to invest to support our long-term growth, including incremental R&D spending for Inphi. However, we expect to more than offset this operating expense growth through deal-related synergies. We expect total cost of synergies for $125 million from the Inphi acquisition with approximately $100 million coming from operating expenses. The midpoint of our second quarter OpEx guidance of $372.5 million includes $10 million of synergy achievement on a run rate basis. We expect to achieve half of our targeted OpEx synergy exiting fiscal 2022 and the full synergy realization by the third quarter of fiscal 2023. We'll continue to be disciplined in allocating resources and expect to drive revenue growth significantly higher than OpEx growth to deliver strong earnings expansion. The remaining $25 million of cost synergies will come from cost goods sold, which we expect to start to take effect in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023 and be fully realized by the third quarter of the same year. Our team has a strong track record of integration execution from prior acquisitions. I'm very confident about our synergy achievement plan. Now, turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, which included a full quarter of Inphi. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.065 billion, plus or minus 3%. At the middle point of this outlook, we expect approximately $250 million of revenue contribution from the Inphi business. As Matt mentioned earlier, at this level of revenue, we expect the Inphi business will be accretive to our non-GAAP earnings. We expect our GAAP gross margin in the range of 34.8% to 37.5%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin to be approximately 64%. In a tight supply environment, we expect our non-GAAP gross margin in the near future to remain around this level, subject to product mix change in any given quarter. We project our GAAP operating expense to be in the range of $633 million to $643 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $370 million to $375 million. Following the Inphi acquisition, the company domicile changed from Bermuda to Delaware. Based on tax deductions and credits we have, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to remain at 5% for the remainder of the fiscal year. And the current tax laws, we expect our non-GAAP tax rate to increase by approximately 100 basis points each year for the next couple of years. We expect other expenses will be approximately $34.5 million, which include interest expense of $33 million. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 822 million and our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be $835 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP loss per share to be $0.37, plus or minus $0.04. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share to be $0.31, plus or minus $0.03. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. On your gross margin question, as you remember, when we announced the Inphi deal, we actually guided the combined company gross margin to be in the range of 64% to 66%. We are actually very pleased with our Q1 gross margin performance. Marvell standalone actually achieved 64.3% under a very tight supply chain environment. As we said before, Inphi actually is accretive to our gross margin. I think the dynamics, as all you know, is supply chain is very tight. And we are trying to really manage it through the supply chain challenge, but we do think the combined company with the Inphi margin higher than 65%, we're going to trend higher going forward when we combine both companies, drive the top line revenue growth. Yes. Okay. Gary, on the OpEx side, given the opportunities and the revenue momentum we have been seeing in front of us, we definitely want to continue to invest. The 5% increase for next year really, it's incorporated the Marvell side for regular increase, we typically at the 2% to 3%. But on the Inphi side, there are tremendous opportunities, so the R&D investment is higher. So we are looking maybe just the next year. And on the synergy side, we talk about the $100 million OpEx synergy achievement. The way to think about it is exiting fiscal 2022, we should be able to achieve 50% of that $100 million run rate synergy. And then as you know, Q1 always seasonally OpEx is a little bit higher because of payroll increase in Q1 than Q2, Q3, by the Q3 time, we should get to the OpEx to the run rate, which achieved the full synergy at the same time, contemplated the increase, offset the increase of the year-over-year. In the longer-term, you should expect us to continue to focus on to grow revenue significantly faster than OpEx, so we can expand the earnings quickly. Srini, maybe I'll answer your first question on the Inphi guide, right? So what we guide for Q2 combined company Inphi revenue, we said, is about $215 million. So in Q1, we only had $22 million of Inphi business. So you really cannot compare sequentially year-over-year, if you look at $215 million Inphi revenue, it means almost 24% year-over-year increase. On the Marvell side, I would say we guided basically, as Matt has said earlier, slightly up sequentially for the Marvell networking. So if you add Marvell networking plus Inphi's $215 million, that's what our guide for Q2 networking business. I'll let Matt answer the - your second question."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. And please note that this event is being recorded today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead, sir.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Willem Meintjes, our new CFO. Let me remind everyone that certain comments made today include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measure is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by welcoming Willem, who is participating today in his first Marvell earnings call since being named CFO in January. Having previously served as Marvell's Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer since 2018, Willem has deep institutional knowledge of our company and our end markets, which has helped him seamlessly transition into his new role. I look forward to partnering with him, as we continue to execute on the many opportunities in front of us. Turning to our business results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue was $1.42 billion, growing 6% year-over-year, above the midpoint of guidance, with better-than-expected results from our data center end market. Sequentially, as our customers dealt with a broad-based inventory correction, revenue declined by 8%, with the majority of the reduction coming from storage products within our data center end market. The rest of our end markets held up relatively well in a worsening macroeconomic environment. Revenue grew sequentially in carrier, consumer and auto industrial and declined slightly in enterprise networking. Looking ahead to the first quarter, the inventory correction that we described last quarter has continued to impact near-term demand, along with typical seasonality for some of our products. As a result, at the midpoint of guidance, we are expecting consolidated revenue to decline by 8% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. In addition, coming out of the supply crunch, broadening inventory corrections are creating an unusual revenue mix. In the first quarter, we expect storage to decline further and inventory correction to spread to a number of additional areas I will discuss later. At the same time, we are forecasting very strong sequential growth in revenue from 5G and a number of custom ASICs, but these have gross margins well below Marvell's corporate average. As a result, we expect a challenging gross margin outlook for the next few quarters. However, we are confident that once we emerge from the inventory digestion phase into a more normalized environment, we will be well positioned for our gross margins to recover. Willem will discuss our expectations in his prepared remarks. Let me move on now to discussing our end markets, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the fourth quarter was $498 million, declining 13% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. Revenue was higher than anticipated, driven by better-than-expected results, primarily from our PAM DSPs and data center switches. As expected, our storage business was responsible for the bulk of the overall sequential decline in our data center revenue. Our results reflect the deceleration in the data center end market and the beginning of efforts by our customers to adjust their inventory to respond to a more challenging market conditions. We are expecting this trend to continue and are projecting lower demand to impact multiple data center products. As a result, we expect revenue in the first quarter from our data center end market to decline in the mid-teens sequentially on a percentage basis. We project data center storage to decline again sequentially in the first quarter across HDD, SSD and fiber channel and also expect to see inventory adjustments to a lesser degree, broadly impact the rest of our data center products. Slowdown in spending signaled this year by multiple large data center customers is also impacting the timing of the ramp of our cloud optimized design wins. Our key design win projects remain intact, but the start of production for some of these programs is being delayed. As a result, the revenue ramp has shifted out by a couple of quarters compared to prior projections. Our lifetime revenue expectations from these design wins remain in the same range as previously communicated. While we work through the near-term dynamics in the data center, we remain confident in the growth outlook for this end market. We are seeing data center customers prioritizing key growth areas such as AI and ML with potentially much larger investment over the next few years. Our relationship with Tier 1 cloud customers has continued to deepen as we engage with their architects on helping solve their most pressing challenges in their next-generation data centers with optimized customer specific solutions. One key example is the collaboration we announced with Amazon Web Services intended to enable cloud-first silicon design, extending the long-standing relationship between our companies. Marvell is a strategic supplier to AWS, delivering cloud optimized silicon that helps meet the infrastructure needs of AWS customers, including the delivery of electro-optics, networking, security, storage and custom design solutions addressing multiple critical applications. We believe Marvell's leadership in essential silicon technologies helps AWS push the boundaries of data center performance essential for driving their long-term growth. Earlier today, we announced our new Nova optical DSPs and Teralynx 10 switches for next-generation data center networks. Nova is the first commercially available PAM4 optical DSP to provide 200 gig per wavelength, twice the throughput of existing solutions over the same physical fiber. This breakthrough made possible by a significant improvement in electro-optics technology enables the industry's first 1.6 terabits per second pluggable optical modules. These modules provide twice the bandwidth in a physical package similar to existing solutions and are essential for the full deployment of 51.2T switches within the size and thermal density constraints of data centers. The higher performance enabled by this new 200 gig, 5-nanometer PAM DSP helps to extend the lead in electro-optics Inphi established and driving the market from 25-gig NRZ, 50-gig PAM to 100-gig PAM. The Nova platform provides a complete 1.6T solution, including DSPs, TIAs and drivers to the optical module ecosystem, reinforcing our expectations that pluggables will continue to remain the backbone of high-speed optical networking within data centers for the foreseeable future. Teralynx 10, a 5-nanometer programmable 51.2 terabit per second solution marks the latest in a series of cloud-optimized, low-latency, high bandwidth switches designed for use in leaf-and-spine architectures. The switch was designing close collaboration with leading cloud customers and Teralynx 10 together with Nova, creates a full platform to enable the next leap in bandwidth for cloud data centers. This is a tangible realization of the benefit of combining Marvell, Inphi and Innovium into a single entity focused on data infrastructure. This combination of 51.2T switches with 1.6T optics enables a quadrupling in bandwidth versus existing solutions. This significant breakthrough in capacity at a lower power and cost per bit will be a compelling TCO driver for customers to viably upgrade their networks to support the large increase in bandwidth they need for AI and other applications. For customers, the co-deployment of Nova-based pluggable modules and Teralynx 10 switches should reduce their risk and accelerate time-to-market. And when combined with Marvell's extensive verification and interoperability testing should also minimize their work in transitioning to a new technology. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $275 million, growing 14% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Marvell's wireless and wired businesses drove strong year-on-year growth. We saw a strong demand for our wireless products as 5G adoption continue to expand. Our wired business benefited from carrier backbone bandwidth upgrades that accelerated during the pandemic. At Mobile World Congress, we announced our next-generation 5-nanometer OCTEON Fusion 10 baseband processor. This customizable wireless platform has been adopted by leading base station OEMs to provide comprehensive, in-line layer 1 acceleration. This new processor, along with our previously announced OCTEON 10 DPU provides a complete processing platform for 5G baseband, transport, and massive MIMO. At MWC, we continue to see strong interest from multiple customers and partners for our latest generation of 5G products for both conventional and cloud-based architectures. Moving on to our outlook for the next quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we are expecting significant growth in our wireless business with revenue projected to increase by approximately 25% sequentially driven by 5 G deployments in multiple geographies and our customer-specific product ramps. On the other hand, after an extended period of strong growth in our wired business, we are expecting revenue to decline in the double digits sequentially on a percentage basis. As a result, for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenue from our overall carrier end market to grow in the mid-single digits sequentially in the mid-teens year-over-year on a percentage basis. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $366 million, with a strong 39% year-over-year growth, driven primarily by higher content and growing share of our merchant products, which drove the vast majority of our revenue in this end market in fiscal 2023. Sequentially, our revenue declined by 3% as we started to decrease channel inventory of our run rate merchant products, including further reductions in China. This was partially offset by growth in custom ASICs. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we are planning for additional reduction in channel and customer inventory of our merchant products and enterprise networking. However, we expect a strong ramp in custom ASICs to partially offset this decline. As a result, we project our overall enterprise networking revenue to decline in the high single-digits sequentially, while year-over-year growth is projected to remain strong in the high teens on a percentage basis. Turning to our automotive and industrial end markets. Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 25% year-over-year to $99 million. Sequential revenue growth accelerated to 18% as supply improved. Looking to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we project continued sequential growth from our auto business to be more than offset by a decline in our industrial business. Year-over-year, we expect our auto business to continue strong growth of over 30%, offset by a decline from our industrial business. As a result for our overall auto and industrial end market, we expect revenue to decline approximately 10% sequentially and be up \u2013 flat to up slightly year-over-year. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $180 million, declining 3% year-over-year and growing 1% sequentially. Revenue from our consumer SSD controllers continue to grow, while we saw declines in legacy printer ASICs and HDD controllers. Looking ahead to the first quarter, which tends to be seasonally softer in the consumer end market, we are forecasting revenue to decline sequentially by approximately 10%. In summary, fiscal 2023 was a very strong year for Marvell, with revenue growing 33% year-over-year to $5.9 billion, well above the industry and our long-term target model. Revenue from cloud grew approximately 50% year-over-year. Annual revenue from 5G crossed over $600 million and auto crossed over $200 million, important milestones for both end markets. During fiscal 2023, the first full year following the acquisition of Innovium, we drove a significant ramp in our data center switch revenue as a combined team. The Inphi portfolio continued to fire on all cylinders, with a strong ramp of our 800-gig PAM4 DSPs and 400ZR data center interconnect products. We completed the acquisition of Tanzanite to accelerate our organic CXL development. Our enterprise networking business had a tremendous year with revenue growing 51% year-over-year, reflecting the significant share and content gains we have driven over the last two years. Through this period of rapid growth, we scaled the company in a thoughtful manner with non-GAAP OpEx growing 20% year-over-year, well below the 33% growth in revenue. Following another strong year for design wins, our opportunity funnel continues to expand with many large sockets that we believe Marvell is well positioned to win. While the broader semiconductor industry, including Marvell, is dealing with near-term headwinds, we are confident in our ability to weather this cycle and continue to execute over the long-term. We remain laser focused on capital allocation and improving efficiency. We are evaluating our customers' latest plans, assessing our level of investment across the portfolio and redirecting resources to our best opportunities. As a result, we expect to reduce our OpEx in the second half of fiscal 2024. Over the long-term, our prospects remain compelling. We have conviction in our plan, and we will continue to invest to support our strategy. As fiscal 2024 progresses, we expect the headwinds from inventory digestion will begin to subside, and mix will improve as demand patterns normalize. While storage has been impacted the most from inventory digestion, we are encouraged to see that customers have started to reduce their finished goods stock, clearing the path for a recovery. Revenue from OEM customers in China has declined to less than 10% of total company revenue. But as China reopens, we expect demand will recover and become a tailwind. In fiscal 2024, we expect data center switching and 400ZR will continue to grow, and revenue from our cloud optimized silicon programs start to layer in. In addition, we project our 5G and auto end markets will continue to grow in fiscal 2024. As a result, for overall Marvell, we expect revenue to start growing in the second quarter and gather momentum in the second half of the fiscal year. Longer-term, we are confident that our focus on data infrastructure and exposure to diversified end markets with secular growth position us well for the future. In our wireless end market, we expect content gains to layer in as 5G adoption continues worldwide. Our automotive opportunity continues to grow, and we see a path to growing revenue to over $500 million annually over the next few years. In data center, we expect to open up new revenue streams from emerging CXL and AEC opportunities. We expect generative AI to drive a massive transformation in data center architecture. We see a bigger opportunity for cloud optimized silicon for custom compute, trend we had extensively discussed over the last couple of years. In addition to compute, the level of scaling in these generative models requires a significant innovation and technology leadership in networking infrastructure to interconnect AI supercomputers. This requires ultra-high bandwidth links with low latency and sufficient reach, minimizing energy expended to move the massive amounts of data in these platforms is another important criteria. We believe these requirements are best met by high-speed optical connections. Last year, we launched the industry's first 800 gig PAM DSP and saw a huge ramp driven almost exclusively by AI applications. Our PAM DSP revenue from AI in fiscal 2023, more than quadrupled from the prior year. As AI models continue to grow in complexity, we expect that they will require more and more low-latency bandwidth. Earlier today, we announced the industry's first 1.6 terabit per second PAM platform, enabling a further doubling of bandwidth within the AI cluster. As investment in AI accelerates, we see this as a new growth engine for our electro-optics portfolio. As you've often heard me say, our employees are Marvell's greatest resource, the culture they have built is the foundation of our ongoing success. In January, Glassdoor named Marvell as one of the top 100 Best Places to Work in the US for 2023. We are in the second highest ranking among semiconductor companies. In February, we were honored to receive the Great Place to Work certification. These awards are a testament to our culture and dedication to creating a collaborative, compassionate and respectful workplace, while remaining focused on growth and execution. Thank our entire team for their contributions to Marvell to enable us to develop leading-edge essential technology that helps power the world's data infrastructure. With that, I'll turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nWillem Meintjes: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our fiscal year 2023 results. Marvell's revenue grew significantly by 33% year-on-year to a record $5.92 billion. GAAP gross margin was 50.5% and GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.19. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 64.5%. Our GAAP operating margin was 4%. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 35.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share grew 35% year-on-year to $2.12. We returned $319 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Moving on to our financial results for the fourth quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.419 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, growing 6% year-over-year and declining 8% sequentially. Data center was our largest end market driving 35% of our total revenue. Enterprise networking was the next largest, with 26% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 19%, consumer at 13% and auto industrial at 7%. GAAP gross margin was 47.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.5%, 50 basis points below forecast, primarily due to a change in revenue mix within certain end markets compared to our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $650 million, including share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal settlements and acquisition related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $431 million. GAAP operating margin was 1.6%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.1%. For the fourth quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.02. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.46 at the midpoint of guidance. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $352 million. This included $56 million in payments for long-term capacity agreements. In fiscal 2023, payments for long-term capacity totaled $252 million. Looking ahead to fiscal 2024, we are currently anticipating significantly lower payments for capacity and a much reduced headwind to operating cash flow. Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.07 billion, growing by $111 million sequentially. As we indicated in our prior call, we expected inventory to grow in the fourth quarter to support upcoming product ramps. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect inventory to start to come down and be a tailwind to operating cash flow over the year. We returned $51 million to shareholders through cash dividends. As of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $911 million, growing by $188 million from the prior quarter. Our total debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.87 times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.49 times. $500 million of our total debt is due in June 2023. We are currently planning on paying this off using our cash balance and free cash flow, which we expect to improve our gross leverage. Turning to our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1 3 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 44.1% to 46.1%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 60%. This guidance takes into account the adverse revenue mix we are expecting in the first quarter, and we currently expect mix will remain challenging for a few quarters. Once we get through this period of inventory correction, combined with cost improvement actions underway, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to get closer to the low end of our target range by the fourth quarter. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $687 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $460 million. This forecast includes a step-up from the prior quarter due to typical seasonality in payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases. As Matt discussed, we intend to continue to invest prudently in our long-term growth initiatives while further improving efficiency and optimizing capital deployment. Altogether, we expect to reduce our non-GAAP operating expense run rate by approximately $15 million a quarter in the second half of the year. We expect the full reduction to be achieved in the fourth quarter. Other income and expense, including interest on our debt is expected to be approximately $49 million. For the first quarter, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 7%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 858 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 863 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP loss per share in the range of $0.12 to $0.20 per share. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.24 to $0.34. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nRoss Seymore: Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Matt, I just wanted to ask about the general business conditions. In the last quarter, you talked about -- in the October quarter, you said that things were weakening towards the end of the quarter and then throughout the January quarter. Can you talk about the linearity of demand, whether it be by end markets and/or geographies as you go through the end of the January quarter and thus far into the April quarter?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks Ross for the question. We've seen the business conditions continue to weaken, I'd say, in the last couple of months, the I'd say the breadth and some of the steepness of the decline. We've continued to see -- we had thought that storage was going to kind of bottom out. Last quarter, it's down again. There are some green shoots there just given what we see in terms of end customer stock levels coming down, and we believe that throughout the year, that's going to improve. But I'd say just, generally, in the storage area broadly and then in the data center, as you can see from our guidance. not only in storage, but a little bit broader. The inventory correction is still going on. At the same time, I think what's happened in the wireless business in 5G, that's continued to be very resilient and growing, which is a positive as automotive as well continues to be very strong for us, and we see that as a growing business again this year. That's on a great upward trajectory. So, a lot of moving pieces, Ross, but I'd say the things that were weaker a quarter ago have continued to weaken a little bit more. And then the areas where we had some optimism, those have continued to do better. It's really interesting how these various end markets are kind of moving at different times. But when you add it all up, basically, and you look out over the next few quarters, we do see growth in the second quarter and then as a result of really what we believe will be the inventory digestion and the normalization in the back half plus continued strength in things like 5G and automotive and then also our cloud optimized ramp. And in theory, some of the China business should come back, we're starting to be optimistic about the second half relative to the recovery. So that's some of the moving pieces, and I agree, it's -- in the infrastructure business, this doesn't move up and down typically as much as, say, a consumer business. So it started in October. We're still going through the journey here in the January and April quarters, and then we see a recovery in the second half.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Matt, I'm curious what second half recovery looks like? Is there the potential to get back to this kind of $1.5-ish billion quarterly run rate, you guys were at. And then as part of that, I'm also curious to know what should be the updated view $400 million and $800 million in cloud-optimized silicon. And the one thing that I think Willem mentioned that you will only be able to get to the lower end of the gross margin range. I'm a little confused that if there is the recovery, then why would you be at the lower end of the gross margin range. So kind of related questions. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes. No problem, Vivek. We'll treat it as one integrated question. So let me start with the cloud optimized ramp. As I said in my prepared remarks, and you can see sort of what's happening in the data center area, there is some delay, and there's some prioritization within those companies on how they're going to deploy. We feel very good overall about the programs and the lifetime revenue of those programs, but they have, in aggregate, shifted out by a couple of quarters. So if you just assume that the plan for $400 million this year was more back-end loaded as those ramped then the effect of that pushing out by a couple of quarters, we think it probably takes it down by about half. We don't know quite yet exactly, but just to give you a big round numbers, I think that's a safe assumption for now. The other question was around what does the second half recovery look like. I think it's too early to call it specifically at this point. I mean we're still seeing a lot of volatility in the business, as you can see from our first quarter guide. But when we step back and look at it from 30,000 feet and we also take the broad indicators from our customers, we do expect it as we said, to start growing from Q2 and beyond. The question is how big is the recovery and what comes back. So it's a little bit hard to call precisely where that's going to be at this juncture. And then on gross margins, again, it really comes down to the mix. Historically, if you look, we've -- the company has actually had pretty stable gross margins. I mean, they've moved around a little bit, but in general, that's been a fairly predictable thing. You can see based on this downturn we're going through just the volatility that's come in relative to the mix. So we see that improving in the second half. Again, I think it's too early to call the exact trajectory. So just in the abundance of being prudent here, we're calling it getting up to the lower end of the range. But again, it's highly dependent on mix, product ramps and what the end markets do. This is the best we know at this time.\nVivek Arya: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. Matt, I wanted to ask about generative AI and to the extent your customer conversations have evolved over the past couple of months. You talked about the cloud optimized opportunity being pushed out. But have you sensed any change in customer pull as it relates to AI? You talked about your exposure in compute and networking. You also talked about your PAM DSP business, specifically in AI quadrupling last year. Curious how you're thinking about that business in fiscal 2024? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yeah. I think the -- as we said in the prepared remarks, the impact of generative AI and the buzz around that is a real positive for Marvell. The ramp on our 800-gig products really over the last few years was driven by AI clusters and AI applications. So that's gone very, very well, and we see a tailwind there over time on our optics business. I'd also note, we just announced today our 1.6 terabit per second product, which also has native 200-gig per lane I/O. That's a real product that's sampling, and it's going to go into production, we believe, sometime next year. And again, the big pull there will be because of the doubling of the bandwidth, another ramp for us relative to AI. So that under the hood, despite a lot of the chop in the other businesses, has been a real bright spot for us. And we're very encouraged on that outlook. And then, in addition, some of these systems for AI clusters are going to get -- have to get -- data centers are going to have to get rearchitected quite frankly. And we think that's also going to drive the need for cloud optimized silicon as well to complement the GPUs that are used, as well as the optics. So, I think, there's a broader opportunity here for sure. I think this is a very bright spot for us in the cloud. And I think it's evolving very quickly. Ashish, did you want to add anything to that?\nAshish Saran: No, I think the other thing I'd add is, I think we're already starting to see requests from cloud customers to really accelerate the availability of our next-gen products, right? I think we've seen a distinct change in tone, I would say, over the last quarter or two where we introduced our 1.60 as an example. You're certainly getting a request at a, how quickly can it become available, because they see the bandwidth needs really expanding very, very quickly. So I think it's very critical for us to get these products out even faster.\nToshiya Hari: Thanks, guys.\nOperator: And our next question will come from C. J. Muse of Evercore. Please, go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Just routine part for you, Matt. So I won't take too long. But specific to data center, I was hoping we could drill a little bit deeper into kind of the trends you've seen year-on-year based on the implied guide. So roughly, I think, down to $220 million. Is there a way to kind of parse through how much of that is storage, preamp, fiber channel and other? And maybe help us better understand kind of the slowdown in other, what drove that? And then from here, how do you think about the different parts between kind of storage, other and the new products that you already kind of spoke about. So we have a pretty good idea there. But any way to kind of frame that would be very helpful.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Sure. Yes, C. J., sure, go ahead. I'll let Willem start off, and then I can add to it as appropriate. Great question.\nWillem Meintjes: Yes. So, I think, first of all, on a year-over-year basis, storage is a much bigger part of that decline for Q1. The way we think about it, C. J., we spoke originally about the $1.4 billion for storage, right? And so, if you look at that on a quarterly basis, it's about 60% was data center. So on a quarterly basis, it's just over $200 million. And last quarter, we obviously indicated that was down significantly. And this quarter, again, the decrease in data center was more in storage compared to the rest.\nC.J. Muse: I guess, is there a way to frame what the other parties outside of storage? I mean, it certainly feels like roughly maybe $150 million out of the $220 million decline in storage, but we'd love to isolate on that 70 and how you see that part of your business recovery?\nAshish Saran: Hey CJ, it's Ashish. Let me just add some more color. So I think if you look at the year-on-year, the much bigger portion of storage, as Willem just walked through, if you think about all the other product lines, right, this include optics as well as some of our networking products within data center, that's where we're seeing a much smaller decline in Q1. These inventory corrections take typically a couple of quarters, right? So I think you'll expect them to start to bounce back, I would say, in the second half. And I think they get a lot bigger. So the non-storage portion of data center really starts to recover in the second half and gets a lot bigger. And on top of that, even though we have pushed out some of the ramps of our cloud optimized, on an incremental basis, you will see some additional revenue in the second half. So overall, non-storage is a big part of how we see data center recovering in the second half of the year.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe Moore: Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the gross margin pressure in the April quarter, carrier being up mid-single digit is not that much incremental revenue. Can you just give us some sense for the gross margin disparity between the carrier centric custom business and the rest of it? And then I guess, separate from that, as you ramp other parts of custom ASIC into cloud, do you expect to see that be more like the corporate gross margin.\nWillem Meintjes: Yeah. So let me start. So the way to think about that is, I think in the prepared remarks we just said wire was done significantly about 20% and that was offset by the growth in wireless. So net-net, you see a small growth there, but it's those two dynamics that offsetting each other.\nJoe Moore: Okay. And I mean, it seems like still even 25% growth in 5G, to cause a four-point margin disparity overall, it seems like\u2026\nWillem Meintjes: Yeah, sure. So I think the way to look at it is overall, we saw additional weakness in storage, particularly in HCV and fiber channel, which typically is higher gross margin product for us. In addition, we've seen a decrease in our merchant enterprise networking business, which is also a higher gross margin product. And so that with the growth in 5G, and then also we've seen some strong increase in our ASIC business, which both of those are typically slightly lower gross margin product. And that in combination with -- certainly with the top line coming down, we've had some headwinds from fixed cost absorption. And so overall, that's driving the decrease that you're seeing.\nMatt Murphy: Hey Joe, let me add a couple of things because it's a very good question. So first, fully agree with everything Willem said in the way he characterized it, which is fundamentally that we had some accretive to gross margin product lines declined fairly significantly and fairly rapidly. And at the same time, we're seeing strong growth in product lines that are less than the corporate average, and it's moved the gross margin much more significantly than anything we've experienced in some time. And maybe just to take it from the top on a bigger picture for a second. Our custom business came from the purchase of Avera back in 2019. And we knew at that time that was going to be a lower gross margin business and that was fine. And it's actually grown really well. The team has executed well. It's been a great growth driver for us. And we've been able to -- and in fact, if you look, it's probably grown faster than the overall Marvell portfolio. But at the same time, call it, from 2020 to now, we've actually been able to increase and drive Marvell's gross margins up over that timeframe. So, we've had a balanced portfolio, different product lines and diversified product lines that have a wide range of gross margins that blend to something that's been very, very healthy and in general, been very predictable. What was -- the change was really the steepness and the breadth of the inventory correction we're dealing with. And so you have these growth drivers that are still kicking in on ASIC. And then also carrier, as you point out, has always been a lower gross margin business for us. We've been very transparent about that. Those are actually continuing to grow through this cycle quite significantly. And then again, our highest margin product lines for various reasons, whether it's channel inventory correction or just customers doing their own inventory burn, those have come down a lot. So, that's why we think and we look at the numbers, over the next few quarters, that should start to normalize again. So, I hope that's helpful to provide both the detail and then the bigger picture, Joe.\nJoe Moore: Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Ramsay: Thank you very guys. Good afternoon. Matt, you guys talked about maybe the change in timing and the push out a bit of the cloud-optimized $400 million for this year. But when you look into next year, that $800 million that you guys have talked about for a while is obviously not just one customer or one program, right? And all of these hyperscale folks are going through different architecture changes, periods of digestion and you can -- there's a number of words probably to characterize it. So, I guess what I'm trying to get at is if things are delayed a couple of quarters and the early ramp of early programs, how are you thinking about that $800 million next year? Are there some programs that are pushed a bit, some that are still on time? And maybe you could just -- maybe walk through some of that dynamic? And then just a real quick clarification on a question that Joe asked. As we ramp these cloud optimized solutions, are those going to be accretive to gross margin specifically? Maybe you could address that a bit. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. So, for next year, I'd say my high-level answer is it's too early to call. And you kind of nailed it. I mean some of the programs are tracking as we thought, some even might be a little bit ahead. Some have pushed out more than we thought. So, the net effect for this year, we're just trying to call it as we see it today on the shift. Now, for next year, I don't know that it just keeps sliding. I think some of these are going to ramp at their own pace. And quite frankly, it's too early to call it and to understand what's going to happen four or five quarters from now, given how much is changing in the near term. I guess I'm reticent to try to provide any more precision there. I mean, I think if you want to be conservative, you could just sort of keep shifting it out a little bit, but I think there's still a call option for growth for Marvell next year in this area, but we have to see how these programs play out. And I think on the question of the margins, it really depends on the program. They're not all the same and some are more custom in nature that would be more traditional profile. Some are higher. But we still see the blend for the overall company returning back to its towards the low end of the range this year, and then we're going to keep driving it towards our long-term model in the next year. So at this point, I think it's too early to call and kind of infer what that the gross margins of those programs would be and then when they ramp versus what's going to happen next year. So as we get through the year, I think, Matt, we can give you more precision on that. But we're not changing our long-term growth model at this point in terms of the financial model, whether it's gross margins or long-term revenue growth and operating margins.\nMatt Ramsay: Thanks, Matt. Appreciate the color.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJeremy Kwan: Yes, good afternoon. This is Jeremy calling in for Tore. I guess I want to focus in a little bit on the custom silicon. It sounds like this business has proven more resilient than other areas of the data center. Is this a function of the nature of those programs and the NRE investments in your customers that may and maybe you get better visibility in true end demand? And also, is this resiliency reflected in some of your ongoing current custom programs, maybe more specifically comparing the pushouts here relative to rest of the data center business?\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes, a couple of things that are going on. I think as I said, one, because that business and team has done really well in terms of overall ASIC growth, those programs tend to still be ramping. So there's not a lot of inventory that's been built that's been part of the growth. So that would explain some of it. But I'd also note that the breadth of the engagements we have in this traditional custom area, our data center, but they're also in carrier and they're also in enterprise. And so as Willem indicated, even within the enterprise segment, we've had some mix shift there just with the traditional merchant products, which are much higher gross margin coming down and then some of the ASIC stuff ramping up. So again, I think this is all going to get normalized over time. But certainly, because of the growth in that area, it's proven to be very resilient. And I think some of it is maybe because sure, we've gotten NRE. You get -- I think there's just -- historically, that team has had a -- those -- that type of business has been one that's been, I think, a little bit easier to plan. It seems to be a little bit more predictable, I don't know. But I think in general, it's mostly because they're new programs ramping.\nJeremy Kwan: And can you talk about the pushouts here relative to the other segments? Have there been any significant changes there?\nMatt Murphy: Sorry, say that again?\nJeremy Kwan: I guess, has the custom program has been impacted by the pushouts you're seeing in other areas of data center?\nMatt Murphy: No. I mean, again, I wouldn't say that's a major factor. I mean, again, some of the cloud optimized programs that we talked about, those are custom. But in the short term, the data center impact has really been, again, more driven by storage and the impact on the rest of the portfolio, whether it be custom or optics, or whatever hasn't been as pronounced, but it's still going through its own correction.\nJeremy Kwan: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please, go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to -- I just want to understand what your message is on data centers. So the hard drive, it's more of a correction -- inventory correction at your customer. What are you seeing from just overall data center? Because I thought the message last quarter was the PAM business and switching were actually kind of okay. So, I guess, when you're talking about cloud optimized pushing out and you said data center is softer, I'm trying to understand how those two relate, I guess. And then you mentioned architecture changes, if you can just elaborate a little more. I'm still kind of confused what you're saying on data center and why that's delaying the cloud ramp.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Maybe, I'll break it into two pieces. So let's go back to -- because I think there's two separate issues we're talking about. So last quarter, when we signaled the weakness in data center, it was very pronounced in storage. And we also said we were starting to see signs of inventory correction on the rest of the portfolio, but it was more muted. And at that time, our expectation was that storage most likely was going to at least flat now, maybe go down a little bit more. And then there'll be, again, a continued more mild correction. I think what's happened is, the data center -- the storage in data centers continue to need more time to correct. So that's declined again in the Q1 guide. And then, I would say, the rest of the portfolio has also -- is now seeing more of a correction needed than we thought last quarter. Okay. So that's in the short term right now, Blayne. So, yes, storage, down a little bit more and then the rest of the portfolio, including those other product lines you mentioned, in aggregate. I mean, within underneath, some of them are moving up and down, but the net effect is that there is an inventory correction going on in data center across the portfolio. Independent of that, we -- is a separate issue. We were -- we have been anticipating a ramp of our cloud optimized design wins, which have been gathered over the last few years. That's still going to happen this year, but it's been -- some of it's been pushed out by a couple of quarters. So we still see that kicking in at the end of the year and adding to growth. But that's sort of separate than any inventory correction. That's just program execution by our customers, timing of their ramps, et cetera. And then on the third point, which is just, all we were pointing out on the architecture stuff was that, as we see the growth in AI-based systems and AI-based clusters and AI-centric data centers, we think longer term, I mean, that's now outside the window we're talking about here, whether it's this year or next year, that, that's going to be a significant growth trend and that's going to require both cloud-optimized silicon as well as our high-speed optics. So I think three pieces to it, short term, medium term and long term.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks a lot.\nMatt Murphy: Very dynamic overall, Blayne, I guess, that's the punch line.\nBlayne Curtis: Yes. Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please, go ahead.\nChristopher Rolland: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I guess, my first is the $400 million to $800 million regardless of the pushouts. Do you have any visibility into the composition, or can you elaborate on the composition of those wins around maybe percentage storage versus network versus compute and maybe even optics in there as well, anything else that you can offer? Just any visibility into the composition would be great.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Hey Chris, there's a couple of challenges there. So one is there's a very high level of customer sensitivity on the nature of these programs. These are all NDA based. They don't really want us discussing those. Ideally, over time, maybe we can get something more public out there, but until my customers give you the go ahead, I'm not going to do it. All I'd say is just in general, maybe to try to be helpful; it's really not much storage in there. This is really more custom compute, custom networking, accelerators, offload that type of thing. That would be the bulk of it, I would say, those types of applications.\nChristopher Rolland: Okay.\nMatt Murphy: And as we go along, Chris, I think we get closer to these product ramps and things, I'm obviously hoping for our investors, we can continue to provide more transparency as these things materialize, but it's a bit early to talk about that mix. And I'd prefer to do that as we got closer\nChristopher Rolland: Sure. If you didn't like that question, you probably will like this one.\nMatt Murphy: I would love your questions, Chris. Go ahead.\nChristopher Rolland: In terms of AI, you talked about networking, you talked about optics there and that all makes sense. But I was wondering if you had any ability to also provide compute. At one point on your road map, you had AI cards. I think you kind of tabled that effort. But yeah, I would love to know if you can provide compute into AI? And then the second part of that question is, are you willing to guide beyond the $800 million? Do you have visibility into, let's say, beyond $1 billion as it's been some time since you gave that $400 million to $800 million number?\nMatt Murphy: Okay. Maybe just real high-level answer to both of those, I think on the AI one, I think that is and will be an opportunity for custom and for cloud-optimized applications. I think that's a real thing, meaning people will want to use things that are merchant. They want to use some of their own special things and probably in combination. So I think that's an opportunity that's part of the potential. And then as far as the long-term peak revenue from those, the wins, $400 million to $800 million, yeah, I think we said when we won them, it would keep going because typically, you don't hit peak until many years into the ramp. So with the design wins intact, the $800 million becomes larger over time. How big that is? I think it's too early to call. But certainly, it would exceed the $800 million on an annual basis just because really, that was our view at the time of the year one, year two ramp would look something like that.\nChristopher Rolland: Awesome. Thank you, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Karl Ackerman with BNP. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. Thank you. I wanted to delve into data center, if I could, for a second there. It sounds like some of the softness relates to rebalancing of optical modules at hyperscalers, and that's just -- that's not a -- that's more of an industry comment, not just a company specific comment. But I guess for Marvell, does that bleed into the July quarter as well? And then bigger picture, how are you thinking about the 400-gig upgrade cycle for 2023 despite some of the near-term challenges. Does that influence your bigger picture view in terms of 2023 and then 2024, given the broad product portfolio that you have to address both 400 gig and 800 gig? Thank you.\nMat Murphy: Yes, I think at this point, Karl, you're right. I mean we -- part of the inventory digestion we're seeing is our PAM products that sell to the optical module guys, and that's a business where, again, we're kind of one step back in the supply chain. So, we would see that and we are seeing that and feeling it. When exactly that recovers, which quarter, it's going to happen in the next few quarters. The question is next -- this quarter, next quarter or the quarter after, but it's in that probably that timeframe because the underlying demand is still strong. And then I think your other question was on -- and then, of course, the headwind we face now becomes a tailwind in the second half, if that's the case. I think your other question, was it on the 400-gig ZR or was it on the 400-gig inside data center PAM--?\nKarl Ackerman: Your broader portfolio on 400-gig and 800-gig and I guess, how you think about the upgrade cycle because obviously, softer the market near-term, but how do you think about your portfolio broadly as you think about that upgrade cycle over the next couple of quarters? Thanks.\nMat Murphy: Yes, I mean, we tend to think of the upgrade cycle as quite frankly a multiyear rollout, right? We had a very strong year last year, and it's a blend of products, right, from 200, 400, 800 inside data center, 400 ZR between data centers and that 1.6T announced. So, I'd say that the demand and the shift to PAM continues at a very strong rate. Again, we have some inventory correction in the first half. That's more of a module-related issue. And again, the slope of the hyperscale cloud guys revenue growth or CapEx growth kind of dropping, but not declining just not at the same rate of acceleration. So, we think all that works its way through and end consumption continues to grow very strongly last year, this year, and the year after.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey Matt. I guess one clarification and then one question. The clarification, just you talked about the growth in -- driven by AI clusters for high-speed optics. Do you guys -- are you impartial to whether those AI clusters are connected through Ethernet or InfiniBand because I think different hyperscalers have different fabrics for those AI clusters? And then my question is, you guys have talked about the growth in PAM. We've got the OFC show next week, and I think there's more talk now about the linear drive modules where you don't need the DSP or the DSPs and other parts of the line card. I'm just kind of curious if you could address -- do you see any threat from direct driver, linear drive modules going forward to that PAM4 business? Thanks.\nMat Murphy: Sure. Yes. No. So, it's an exciting time for optics at this point given we've got OFC coming up next week. Yes, on the first one, in general, we're agnostic to both of those. We tend to just partner closely with the customers and design the solutions they need. So, it's the fundamental IP that really matters. As it relates to the disruptive technologies that are lurking around out there, I think that's been the history of optics. Our view is pluggables is going to be the high-volume de facto standard for many years to come. And certainly, we're encouraged by showing demonstrations of our new product at 1.6T, you had OFC, there's real people building systems around this. And of course, the ramp last year of 800 gig gives us confidence under the ramp of 1.6T. So we're paying attention to all of it, Quinn, I would say. We've got a really excellent team that understands the trade-offs and understands the various architectures. But right now, we feel very confident in our approach and our solution set. And I think coupled with our switch platform, which has now also been announced, it's really a nice combination of the assets of Marvell plus Inphi plus Innovium, all coming together in a single platform. So more to come on that. And certainly, we're happy to debrief with you and the rest of the team at and after OFC. I think there's going to be a lot of activity there.\nQuinn Bolton: Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Hi, Matt. Question on your wireless business. Obviously, it's good to see that business doing quite well. Some of your peers have reported some weakness in that market. Just curious as to what's driving strength for you in particular? And then as you look out to the next few quarters, can you -- I mean, to the extent that you have visibility, can you talk about the sustainability of that business? Because every time we see 20%, 25% growth in any semiconductor business, we do start to worry about potential inventory build. So if you can talk about what you're seeing out there, that will be helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes. No, I think Srini, I think the big issue, especially with maybe some of the more larger incumbent players that have large carrier communications businesses, especially in the wireless area, they tend to be -- have a combination of some legacy, let's call it, like 4G LTE type of solutions, and then they've got new 5G chips that are ramping up, and then there's some mix of the two. But as you can see with carrier spending, the bulk of it in wireless is just pretty much all going to 5G at this point. And so from a Marvell perspective, we had very little legacy before on the older standard and 5G is really where all the content gains rolled in. So that's continued to be a nice growth driver for us as a result. And I'd say on top of that, you've been around the block enough to see this as well, I mean carrier tends to be a very lumpy business. So it doesn't really historically ever move in a very linear fashion that tends to have be a little bursty at times. And certainly, we're happy with the growth we're seeing, and we think that that's -- overall, this year is going to be a growth year for us in 5G. But certainly, it can be a little bit lumpy. But I would say that this is not something that overall is kind of going according to plan in terms of the designs we won, what the content we could capture would be. And finally, if you just look and we said it in the prepared remarks, last year, we crossed the $600 million mark in 5G, which was a bogey we had set several years ago. We haven\u2019t time bounded by the way, like it's going to be in this exact year, this exact four quarters. We had left it a little bit open, but we're pretty happy that really just a few years after we talked about that goal, we were able to achieve it last year. So yes, there's some bright spots for sure, in the Marvell portfolio. 5G is one of them and obviously, automotives and other, and there's some good things going on. We just have to work through the issues in some of the other end markets. And with that, I think, Ashish, is that our last question?\nAshish Saran: Yes, it is, Matt. If you can maybe end with some closing remarks, that would be great.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Perfect. Well, I appreciate everybody's time on the call today. When I look back at our last fiscal year, it was a great success for Marvell. I think it -- and I was reflecting back, looking at where we were back, let's say, in 2020, during the pandemic, we were in the process of combining with Inphi and I sort of look a few years later, and I think in fiscal 2023, we -- ourselves, Inphi and also, by the way, the Innovium team we brought in, really everybody executed extremely well. It was very, very strong growth, very strong margins, great growth overall. Certainly, we're going through, now after several years of extremely strong growth, a correction in inventory, that's more pronounced in some markets than others. We're managing through that very prudently and expeditiously and doing that also in a partnership model with our customers, to where we're trying to understand their real demand and get back to a point where we're shipping back to real demand. At this point, we believe we're shipping below consumption of Marvell products. And so, we want to get back there. And when we do that, it will also lead to the increase in recovery back in the gross margin profile. And then we can have all of our new wins that we've gotten and all the hard work, our sales team, business unit team has done over the last few years, driving our design win funnel to recognize that growth. So, I'd say, despite the short-term issues, we think very long term at Marvell, okay? I mean, I'm entering my seventh year as -- actually, about to complete my seventh year as CEO. The prospects for this company are tremendous. We have conviction in our end markets and the long-term opportunity. And the R&D investment that's needed to really execute the programs our customers want to is right in front of us. We have an opportunity, I think, to really reassess and make sure that we're focused and laser focused on the best opportunities. I think we've made capital allocation from day one, a strategic priority for Marvell. And I believe, we can come through this cycle much -- as a much stronger company with our growth prospects intact and actually have a better long-term opportunity doing really key programs for our customers with the best ROI. So we're going through that whole process now, as we do always, and I feel very good about the future of the company. So appreciate the time today, everybody, and look forward to catching up post earnings.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you very much for attending today's presentation.

            "name": "Willem Meintjes",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our fiscal year 2023 results. Marvell's revenue grew significantly by 33% year-on-year to a record $5.92 billion. GAAP gross margin was 50.5% and GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.19. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 64.5%. Our GAAP operating margin was 4%. Non-GAAP operating margin expanded to 35.5%. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share grew 35% year-on-year to $2.12. We returned $319 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Moving on to our financial results for the fourth quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.419 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, growing 6% year-over-year and declining 8% sequentially. Data center was our largest end market driving 35% of our total revenue. Enterprise networking was the next largest, with 26% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 19%, consumer at 13% and auto industrial at 7%. GAAP gross margin was 47.5%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.5%, 50 basis points below forecast, primarily due to a change in revenue mix within certain end markets compared to our guidance. GAAP operating expenses were $650 million, including share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal settlements and acquisition related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $431 million. GAAP operating margin was 1.6%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 33.1%. For the fourth quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.02. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.46 at the midpoint of guidance. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $352 million. This included $56 million in payments for long-term capacity agreements. In fiscal 2023, payments for long-term capacity totaled $252 million. Looking ahead to fiscal 2024, we are currently anticipating significantly lower payments for capacity and a much reduced headwind to operating cash flow. Inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.07 billion, growing by $111 million sequentially. As we indicated in our prior call, we expected inventory to grow in the fourth quarter to support upcoming product ramps. Looking ahead to the first quarter, we expect inventory to start to come down and be a tailwind to operating cash flow over the year. We returned $51 million to shareholders through cash dividends. As of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $911 million, growing by $188 million from the prior quarter. Our total debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.87 times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.49 times. $500 million of our total debt is due in June 2023. We are currently planning on paying this off using our cash balance and free cash flow, which we expect to improve our gross leverage. Turning to our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1 3 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 44.1% to 46.1%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 60%. This guidance takes into account the adverse revenue mix we are expecting in the first quarter, and we currently expect mix will remain challenging for a few quarters. Once we get through this period of inventory correction, combined with cost improvement actions underway, we expect non-GAAP gross margin to get closer to the low end of our target range by the fourth quarter. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $687 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $460 million. This forecast includes a step-up from the prior quarter due to typical seasonality in payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases. As Matt discussed, we intend to continue to invest prudently in our long-term growth initiatives while further improving efficiency and optimizing capital deployment. Altogether, we expect to reduce our non-GAAP operating expense run rate by approximately $15 million a quarter in the second half of the year. We expect the full reduction to be achieved in the fourth quarter. Other income and expense, including interest on our debt is expected to be approximately $49 million. For the first quarter, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 7%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 858 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 863 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP loss per share in the range of $0.12 to $0.20 per share. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.24 to $0.34. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. Yes. So, I think, first of all, on a year-over-year basis, storage is a much bigger part of that decline for Q1. The way we think about it, C. J., we spoke originally about the $1.4 billion for storage, right? And so, if you look at that on a quarterly basis, it's about 60% was data center. So on a quarterly basis, it's just over $200 million. And last quarter, we obviously indicated that was down significantly. And this quarter, again, the decrease in data center was more in storage compared to the rest. Yeah. So let me start. So the way to think about that is, I think in the prepared remarks we just said wire was done significantly about 20% and that was offset by the growth in wireless. So net-net, you see a small growth there, but it's those two dynamics that offsetting each other. Yeah, sure. So I think the way to look at it is overall, we saw additional weakness in storage, particularly in HCV and fiber channel, which typically is higher gross margin product for us. In addition, we've seen a decrease in our merchant enterprise networking business, which is also a higher gross margin product. And so that with the growth in 5G, and then also we've seen some strong increase in our ASIC business, which both of those are typically slightly lower gross margin product. And that in combination with -- certainly with the top line coming down, we've had some headwinds from fixed cost absorption. And so overall, that's driving the decrease that you're seeing."

            "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start by welcoming Willem, who is participating today in his first Marvell earnings call since being named CFO in January. Having previously served as Marvell's Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer since 2018, Willem has deep institutional knowledge of our company and our end markets, which has helped him seamlessly transition into his new role. I look forward to partnering with him, as we continue to execute on the many opportunities in front of us. Turning to our business results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue was $1.42 billion, growing 6% year-over-year, above the midpoint of guidance, with better-than-expected results from our data center end market. Sequentially, as our customers dealt with a broad-based inventory correction, revenue declined by 8%, with the majority of the reduction coming from storage products within our data center end market. The rest of our end markets held up relatively well in a worsening macroeconomic environment. Revenue grew sequentially in carrier, consumer and auto industrial and declined slightly in enterprise networking. Looking ahead to the first quarter, the inventory correction that we described last quarter has continued to impact near-term demand, along with typical seasonality for some of our products. As a result, at the midpoint of guidance, we are expecting consolidated revenue to decline by 8% sequentially and 10% year-over-year. In addition, coming out of the supply crunch, broadening inventory corrections are creating an unusual revenue mix. In the first quarter, we expect storage to decline further and inventory correction to spread to a number of additional areas I will discuss later. At the same time, we are forecasting very strong sequential growth in revenue from 5G and a number of custom ASICs, but these have gross margins well below Marvell's corporate average. As a result, we expect a challenging gross margin outlook for the next few quarters. However, we are confident that once we emerge from the inventory digestion phase into a more normalized environment, we will be well positioned for our gross margins to recover. Willem will discuss our expectations in his prepared remarks. Let me move on now to discussing our end markets, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the fourth quarter was $498 million, declining 13% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. Revenue was higher than anticipated, driven by better-than-expected results, primarily from our PAM DSPs and data center switches. As expected, our storage business was responsible for the bulk of the overall sequential decline in our data center revenue. Our results reflect the deceleration in the data center end market and the beginning of efforts by our customers to adjust their inventory to respond to a more challenging market conditions. We are expecting this trend to continue and are projecting lower demand to impact multiple data center products. As a result, we expect revenue in the first quarter from our data center end market to decline in the mid-teens sequentially on a percentage basis. We project data center storage to decline again sequentially in the first quarter across HDD, SSD and fiber channel and also expect to see inventory adjustments to a lesser degree, broadly impact the rest of our data center products. Slowdown in spending signaled this year by multiple large data center customers is also impacting the timing of the ramp of our cloud optimized design wins. Our key design win projects remain intact, but the start of production for some of these programs is being delayed. As a result, the revenue ramp has shifted out by a couple of quarters compared to prior projections. Our lifetime revenue expectations from these design wins remain in the same range as previously communicated. While we work through the near-term dynamics in the data center, we remain confident in the growth outlook for this end market. We are seeing data center customers prioritizing key growth areas such as AI and ML with potentially much larger investment over the next few years. Our relationship with Tier 1 cloud customers has continued to deepen as we engage with their architects on helping solve their most pressing challenges in their next-generation data centers with optimized customer specific solutions. One key example is the collaboration we announced with Amazon Web Services intended to enable cloud-first silicon design, extending the long-standing relationship between our companies. Marvell is a strategic supplier to AWS, delivering cloud optimized silicon that helps meet the infrastructure needs of AWS customers, including the delivery of electro-optics, networking, security, storage and custom design solutions addressing multiple critical applications. We believe Marvell's leadership in essential silicon technologies helps AWS push the boundaries of data center performance essential for driving their long-term growth. Earlier today, we announced our new Nova optical DSPs and Teralynx 10 switches for next-generation data center networks. Nova is the first commercially available PAM4 optical DSP to provide 200 gig per wavelength, twice the throughput of existing solutions over the same physical fiber. This breakthrough made possible by a significant improvement in electro-optics technology enables the industry's first 1.6 terabits per second pluggable optical modules. These modules provide twice the bandwidth in a physical package similar to existing solutions and are essential for the full deployment of 51.2T switches within the size and thermal density constraints of data centers. The higher performance enabled by this new 200 gig, 5-nanometer PAM DSP helps to extend the lead in electro-optics Inphi established and driving the market from 25-gig NRZ, 50-gig PAM to 100-gig PAM. The Nova platform provides a complete 1.6T solution, including DSPs, TIAs and drivers to the optical module ecosystem, reinforcing our expectations that pluggables will continue to remain the backbone of high-speed optical networking within data centers for the foreseeable future. Teralynx 10, a 5-nanometer programmable 51.2 terabit per second solution marks the latest in a series of cloud-optimized, low-latency, high bandwidth switches designed for use in leaf-and-spine architectures. The switch was designing close collaboration with leading cloud customers and Teralynx 10 together with Nova, creates a full platform to enable the next leap in bandwidth for cloud data centers. This is a tangible realization of the benefit of combining Marvell, Inphi and Innovium into a single entity focused on data infrastructure. This combination of 51.2T switches with 1.6T optics enables a quadrupling in bandwidth versus existing solutions. This significant breakthrough in capacity at a lower power and cost per bit will be a compelling TCO driver for customers to viably upgrade their networks to support the large increase in bandwidth they need for AI and other applications. For customers, the co-deployment of Nova-based pluggable modules and Teralynx 10 switches should reduce their risk and accelerate time-to-market. And when combined with Marvell's extensive verification and interoperability testing should also minimize their work in transitioning to a new technology. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $275 million, growing 14% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Marvell's wireless and wired businesses drove strong year-on-year growth. We saw a strong demand for our wireless products as 5G adoption continue to expand. Our wired business benefited from carrier backbone bandwidth upgrades that accelerated during the pandemic. At Mobile World Congress, we announced our next-generation 5-nanometer OCTEON Fusion 10 baseband processor. This customizable wireless platform has been adopted by leading base station OEMs to provide comprehensive, in-line layer 1 acceleration. This new processor, along with our previously announced OCTEON 10 DPU provides a complete processing platform for 5G baseband, transport, and massive MIMO. At MWC, we continue to see strong interest from multiple customers and partners for our latest generation of 5G products for both conventional and cloud-based architectures. Moving on to our outlook for the next quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we are expecting significant growth in our wireless business with revenue projected to increase by approximately 25% sequentially driven by 5 G deployments in multiple geographies and our customer-specific product ramps. On the other hand, after an extended period of strong growth in our wired business, we are expecting revenue to decline in the double digits sequentially on a percentage basis. As a result, for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenue from our overall carrier end market to grow in the mid-single digits sequentially in the mid-teens year-over-year on a percentage basis. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $366 million, with a strong 39% year-over-year growth, driven primarily by higher content and growing share of our merchant products, which drove the vast majority of our revenue in this end market in fiscal 2023. Sequentially, our revenue declined by 3% as we started to decrease channel inventory of our run rate merchant products, including further reductions in China. This was partially offset by growth in custom ASICs. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we are planning for additional reduction in channel and customer inventory of our merchant products and enterprise networking. However, we expect a strong ramp in custom ASICs to partially offset this decline. As a result, we project our overall enterprise networking revenue to decline in the high single-digits sequentially, while year-over-year growth is projected to remain strong in the high teens on a percentage basis. Turning to our automotive and industrial end markets. Revenue in the fourth quarter grew 25% year-over-year to $99 million. Sequential revenue growth accelerated to 18% as supply improved. Looking to the first quarter of fiscal 2024, we project continued sequential growth from our auto business to be more than offset by a decline in our industrial business. Year-over-year, we expect our auto business to continue strong growth of over 30%, offset by a decline from our industrial business. As a result for our overall auto and industrial end market, we expect revenue to decline approximately 10% sequentially and be up \u2013 flat to up slightly year-over-year. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $180 million, declining 3% year-over-year and growing 1% sequentially. Revenue from our consumer SSD controllers continue to grow, while we saw declines in legacy printer ASICs and HDD controllers. Looking ahead to the first quarter, which tends to be seasonally softer in the consumer end market, we are forecasting revenue to decline sequentially by approximately 10%. In summary, fiscal 2023 was a very strong year for Marvell, with revenue growing 33% year-over-year to $5.9 billion, well above the industry and our long-term target model. Revenue from cloud grew approximately 50% year-over-year. Annual revenue from 5G crossed over $600 million and auto crossed over $200 million, important milestones for both end markets. During fiscal 2023, the first full year following the acquisition of Innovium, we drove a significant ramp in our data center switch revenue as a combined team. The Inphi portfolio continued to fire on all cylinders, with a strong ramp of our 800-gig PAM4 DSPs and 400ZR data center interconnect products. We completed the acquisition of Tanzanite to accelerate our organic CXL development. Our enterprise networking business had a tremendous year with revenue growing 51% year-over-year, reflecting the significant share and content gains we have driven over the last two years. Through this period of rapid growth, we scaled the company in a thoughtful manner with non-GAAP OpEx growing 20% year-over-year, well below the 33% growth in revenue. Following another strong year for design wins, our opportunity funnel continues to expand with many large sockets that we believe Marvell is well positioned to win. While the broader semiconductor industry, including Marvell, is dealing with near-term headwinds, we are confident in our ability to weather this cycle and continue to execute over the long-term. We remain laser focused on capital allocation and improving efficiency. We are evaluating our customers' latest plans, assessing our level of investment across the portfolio and redirecting resources to our best opportunities. As a result, we expect to reduce our OpEx in the second half of fiscal 2024. Over the long-term, our prospects remain compelling. We have conviction in our plan, and we will continue to invest to support our strategy. As fiscal 2024 progresses, we expect the headwinds from inventory digestion will begin to subside, and mix will improve as demand patterns normalize. While storage has been impacted the most from inventory digestion, we are encouraged to see that customers have started to reduce their finished goods stock, clearing the path for a recovery. Revenue from OEM customers in China has declined to less than 10% of total company revenue. But as China reopens, we expect demand will recover and become a tailwind. In fiscal 2024, we expect data center switching and 400ZR will continue to grow, and revenue from our cloud optimized silicon programs start to layer in. In addition, we project our 5G and auto end markets will continue to grow in fiscal 2024. As a result, for overall Marvell, we expect revenue to start growing in the second quarter and gather momentum in the second half of the fiscal year. Longer-term, we are confident that our focus on data infrastructure and exposure to diversified end markets with secular growth position us well for the future. In our wireless end market, we expect content gains to layer in as 5G adoption continues worldwide. Our automotive opportunity continues to grow, and we see a path to growing revenue to over $500 million annually over the next few years. In data center, we expect to open up new revenue streams from emerging CXL and AEC opportunities. We expect generative AI to drive a massive transformation in data center architecture. We see a bigger opportunity for cloud optimized silicon for custom compute, trend we had extensively discussed over the last couple of years. In addition to compute, the level of scaling in these generative models requires a significant innovation and technology leadership in networking infrastructure to interconnect AI supercomputers. This requires ultra-high bandwidth links with low latency and sufficient reach, minimizing energy expended to move the massive amounts of data in these platforms is another important criteria. We believe these requirements are best met by high-speed optical connections. Last year, we launched the industry's first 800 gig PAM DSP and saw a huge ramp driven almost exclusively by AI applications. Our PAM DSP revenue from AI in fiscal 2023, more than quadrupled from the prior year. As AI models continue to grow in complexity, we expect that they will require more and more low-latency bandwidth. Earlier today, we announced the industry's first 1.6 terabit per second PAM platform, enabling a further doubling of bandwidth within the AI cluster. As investment in AI accelerates, we see this as a new growth engine for our electro-optics portfolio. As you've often heard me say, our employees are Marvell's greatest resource, the culture they have built is the foundation of our ongoing success. In January, Glassdoor named Marvell as one of the top 100 Best Places to Work in the US for 2023. We are in the second highest ranking among semiconductor companies. In February, we were honored to receive the Great Place to Work certification. These awards are a testament to our culture and dedication to creating a collaborative, compassionate and respectful workplace, while remaining focused on growth and execution. Thank our entire team for their contributions to Marvell to enable us to develop leading-edge essential technology that helps power the world's data infrastructure. With that, I'll turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Yes. Thanks Ross for the question. We've seen the business conditions continue to weaken, I'd say, in the last couple of months, the I'd say the breadth and some of the steepness of the decline. We've continued to see -- we had thought that storage was going to kind of bottom out. Last quarter, it's down again. There are some green shoots there just given what we see in terms of end customer stock levels coming down, and we believe that throughout the year, that's going to improve. But I'd say just, generally, in the storage area broadly and then in the data center, as you can see from our guidance. not only in storage, but a little bit broader. The inventory correction is still going on. At the same time, I think what's happened in the wireless business in 5G, that's continued to be very resilient and growing, which is a positive as automotive as well continues to be very strong for us, and we see that as a growing business again this year. That's on a great upward trajectory. So, a lot of moving pieces, Ross, but I'd say the things that were weaker a quarter ago have continued to weaken a little bit more. And then the areas where we had some optimism, those have continued to do better. It's really interesting how these various end markets are kind of moving at different times. But when you add it all up, basically, and you look out over the next few quarters, we do see growth in the second quarter and then as a result of really what we believe will be the inventory digestion and the normalization in the back half plus continued strength in things like 5G and automotive and then also our cloud optimized ramp. And in theory, some of the China business should come back, we're starting to be optimistic about the second half relative to the recovery. So that's some of the moving pieces, and I agree, it's -- in the infrastructure business, this doesn't move up and down typically as much as, say, a consumer business. So it started in October. We're still going through the journey here in the January and April quarters, and then we see a recovery in the second half. Sure. Yes. No problem, Vivek. We'll treat it as one integrated question. So let me start with the cloud optimized ramp. As I said in my prepared remarks, and you can see sort of what's happening in the data center area, there is some delay, and there's some prioritization within those companies on how they're going to deploy. We feel very good overall about the programs and the lifetime revenue of those programs, but they have, in aggregate, shifted out by a couple of quarters. So if you just assume that the plan for $400 million this year was more back-end loaded as those ramped then the effect of that pushing out by a couple of quarters, we think it probably takes it down by about half. We don't know quite yet exactly, but just to give you a big round numbers, I think that's a safe assumption for now. The other question was around what does the second half recovery look like. I think it's too early to call it specifically at this point. I mean we're still seeing a lot of volatility in the business, as you can see from our first quarter guide. But when we step back and look at it from 30,000 feet and we also take the broad indicators from our customers, we do expect it as we said, to start growing from Q2 and beyond. The question is how big is the recovery and what comes back. So it's a little bit hard to call precisely where that's going to be at this juncture. And then on gross margins, again, it really comes down to the mix. Historically, if you look, we've -- the company has actually had pretty stable gross margins. I mean, they've moved around a little bit, but in general, that's been a fairly predictable thing. You can see based on this downturn we're going through just the volatility that's come in relative to the mix. So we see that improving in the second half. Again, I think it's too early to call the exact trajectory. So just in the abundance of being prudent here, we're calling it getting up to the lower end of the range. But again, it's highly dependent on mix, product ramps and what the end markets do. This is the best we know at this time. Sure. Yeah. I think the -- as we said in the prepared remarks, the impact of generative AI and the buzz around that is a real positive for Marvell. The ramp on our 800-gig products really over the last few years was driven by AI clusters and AI applications. So that's gone very, very well, and we see a tailwind there over time on our optics business. I'd also note, we just announced today our 1.6 terabit per second product, which also has native 200-gig per lane I/O. That's a real product that's sampling, and it's going to go into production, we believe, sometime next year. And again, the big pull there will be because of the doubling of the bandwidth, another ramp for us relative to AI. So that under the hood, despite a lot of the chop in the other businesses, has been a real bright spot for us. And we're very encouraged on that outlook. And then, in addition, some of these systems for AI clusters are going to get -- have to get -- data centers are going to have to get rearchitected quite frankly. And we think that's also going to drive the need for cloud optimized silicon as well to complement the GPUs that are used, as well as the optics. So, I think, there's a broader opportunity here for sure. I think this is a very bright spot for us in the cloud. And I think it's evolving very quickly. Ashish, did you want to add anything to that? Yes. Sure. Yes, C. J., sure, go ahead. I'll let Willem start off, and then I can add to it as appropriate. Great question. Hey Joe, let me add a couple of things because it's a very good question. So first, fully agree with everything Willem said in the way he characterized it, which is fundamentally that we had some accretive to gross margin product lines declined fairly significantly and fairly rapidly. And at the same time, we're seeing strong growth in product lines that are less than the corporate average, and it's moved the gross margin much more significantly than anything we've experienced in some time. And maybe just to take it from the top on a bigger picture for a second. Our custom business came from the purchase of Avera back in 2019. And we knew at that time that was going to be a lower gross margin business and that was fine. And it's actually grown really well. The team has executed well. It's been a great growth driver for us. And we've been able to -- and in fact, if you look, it's probably grown faster than the overall Marvell portfolio. But at the same time, call it, from 2020 to now, we've actually been able to increase and drive Marvell's gross margins up over that timeframe. So, we've had a balanced portfolio, different product lines and diversified product lines that have a wide range of gross margins that blend to something that's been very, very healthy and in general, been very predictable. What was -- the change was really the steepness and the breadth of the inventory correction we're dealing with. And so you have these growth drivers that are still kicking in on ASIC. And then also carrier, as you point out, has always been a lower gross margin business for us. We've been very transparent about that. Those are actually continuing to grow through this cycle quite significantly. And then again, our highest margin product lines for various reasons, whether it's channel inventory correction or just customers doing their own inventory burn, those have come down a lot. So, that's why we think and we look at the numbers, over the next few quarters, that should start to normalize again. So, I hope that's helpful to provide both the detail and then the bigger picture, Joe. Yes. Sure. So, for next year, I'd say my high-level answer is it's too early to call. And you kind of nailed it. I mean some of the programs are tracking as we thought, some even might be a little bit ahead. Some have pushed out more than we thought. So, the net effect for this year, we're just trying to call it as we see it today on the shift. Now, for next year, I don't know that it just keeps sliding. I think some of these are going to ramp at their own pace. And quite frankly, it's too early to call it and to understand what's going to happen four or five quarters from now, given how much is changing in the near term. I guess I'm reticent to try to provide any more precision there. I mean, I think if you want to be conservative, you could just sort of keep shifting it out a little bit, but I think there's still a call option for growth for Marvell next year in this area, but we have to see how these programs play out. And I think on the question of the margins, it really depends on the program. They're not all the same and some are more custom in nature that would be more traditional profile. Some are higher. But we still see the blend for the overall company returning back to its towards the low end of the range this year, and then we're going to keep driving it towards our long-term model in the next year. So at this point, I think it's too early to call and kind of infer what that the gross margins of those programs would be and then when they ramp versus what's going to happen next year. So as we get through the year, I think, Matt, we can give you more precision on that. But we're not changing our long-term growth model at this point in terms of the financial model, whether it's gross margins or long-term revenue growth and operating margins. Sure. Yes, a couple of things that are going on. I think as I said, one, because that business and team has done really well in terms of overall ASIC growth, those programs tend to still be ramping. So there's not a lot of inventory that's been built that's been part of the growth. So that would explain some of it. But I'd also note that the breadth of the engagements we have in this traditional custom area, our data center, but they're also in carrier and they're also in enterprise. And so as Willem indicated, even within the enterprise segment, we've had some mix shift there just with the traditional merchant products, which are much higher gross margin coming down and then some of the ASIC stuff ramping up. So again, I think this is all going to get normalized over time. But certainly, because of the growth in that area, it's proven to be very resilient. And I think some of it is maybe because sure, we've gotten NRE. You get -- I think there's just -- historically, that team has had a -- those -- that type of business has been one that's been, I think, a little bit easier to plan. It seems to be a little bit more predictable, I don't know. But I think in general, it's mostly because they're new programs ramping. Sorry, say that again? No. I mean, again, I wouldn't say that's a major factor. I mean, again, some of the cloud optimized programs that we talked about, those are custom. But in the short term, the data center impact has really been, again, more driven by storage and the impact on the rest of the portfolio, whether it be custom or optics, or whatever hasn't been as pronounced, but it's still going through its own correction. Sure. Maybe, I'll break it into two pieces. So let's go back to -- because I think there's two separate issues we're talking about. So last quarter, when we signaled the weakness in data center, it was very pronounced in storage. And we also said we were starting to see signs of inventory correction on the rest of the portfolio, but it was more muted. And at that time, our expectation was that storage most likely was going to at least flat now, maybe go down a little bit more. And then there'll be, again, a continued more mild correction. I think what's happened is, the data center -- the storage in data centers continue to need more time to correct. So that's declined again in the Q1 guide. And then, I would say, the rest of the portfolio has also -- is now seeing more of a correction needed than we thought last quarter. Okay. So that's in the short term right now, Blayne. So, yes, storage, down a little bit more and then the rest of the portfolio, including those other product lines you mentioned, in aggregate. I mean, within underneath, some of them are moving up and down, but the net effect is that there is an inventory correction going on in data center across the portfolio. Independent of that, we -- is a separate issue. We were -- we have been anticipating a ramp of our cloud optimized design wins, which have been gathered over the last few years. That's still going to happen this year, but it's been -- some of it's been pushed out by a couple of quarters. So we still see that kicking in at the end of the year and adding to growth. But that's sort of separate than any inventory correction. That's just program execution by our customers, timing of their ramps, et cetera. And then on the third point, which is just, all we were pointing out on the architecture stuff was that, as we see the growth in AI-based systems and AI-based clusters and AI-centric data centers, we think longer term, I mean, that's now outside the window we're talking about here, whether it's this year or next year, that, that's going to be a significant growth trend and that's going to require both cloud-optimized silicon as well as our high-speed optics. So I think three pieces to it, short term, medium term and long term. Very dynamic overall, Blayne, I guess, that's the punch line. Yes. Yeah. Hey Chris, there's a couple of challenges there. So one is there's a very high level of customer sensitivity on the nature of these programs. These are all NDA based. They don't really want us discussing those. Ideally, over time, maybe we can get something more public out there, but until my customers give you the go ahead, I'm not going to do it. All I'd say is just in general, maybe to try to be helpful; it's really not much storage in there. This is really more custom compute, custom networking, accelerators, offload that type of thing. That would be the bulk of it, I would say, those types of applications. And as we go along, Chris, I think we get closer to these product ramps and things, I'm obviously hoping for our investors, we can continue to provide more transparency as these things materialize, but it's a bit early to talk about that mix. And I'd prefer to do that as we got closer I would love your questions, Chris. Go ahead. Okay. Maybe just real high-level answer to both of those, I think on the AI one, I think that is and will be an opportunity for custom and for cloud-optimized applications. I think that's a real thing, meaning people will want to use things that are merchant. They want to use some of their own special things and probably in combination. So I think that's an opportunity that's part of the potential. And then as far as the long-term peak revenue from those, the wins, $400 million to $800 million, yeah, I think we said when we won them, it would keep going because typically, you don't hit peak until many years into the ramp. So with the design wins intact, the $800 million becomes larger over time. How big that is? I think it's too early to call. But certainly, it would exceed the $800 million on an annual basis just because really, that was our view at the time of the year one, year two ramp would look something like that. Yeah. Sure. Yes. No, I think Srini, I think the big issue, especially with maybe some of the more larger incumbent players that have large carrier communications businesses, especially in the wireless area, they tend to be -- have a combination of some legacy, let's call it, like 4G LTE type of solutions, and then they've got new 5G chips that are ramping up, and then there's some mix of the two. But as you can see with carrier spending, the bulk of it in wireless is just pretty much all going to 5G at this point. And so from a Marvell perspective, we had very little legacy before on the older standard and 5G is really where all the content gains rolled in. So that's continued to be a nice growth driver for us as a result. And I'd say on top of that, you've been around the block enough to see this as well, I mean carrier tends to be a very lumpy business. So it doesn't really historically ever move in a very linear fashion that tends to have be a little bursty at times. And certainly, we're happy with the growth we're seeing, and we think that that's -- overall, this year is going to be a growth year for us in 5G. But certainly, it can be a little bit lumpy. But I would say that this is not something that overall is kind of going according to plan in terms of the designs we won, what the content we could capture would be. And finally, if you just look and we said it in the prepared remarks, last year, we crossed the $600 million mark in 5G, which was a bogey we had set several years ago. We haven't time bounded by the way, like it's going to be in this exact year, this exact four quarters. We had left it a little bit open, but we're pretty happy that really just a few years after we talked about that goal, we were able to achieve it last year. So yes, there's some bright spots for sure, in the Marvell portfolio. 5G is one of them and obviously, automotives and other, and there's some good things going on. We just have to work through the issues in some of the other end markets. And with that, I think, Ashish, is that our last question? Yes. Perfect. Well, I appreciate everybody's time on the call today. When I look back at our last fiscal year, it was a great success for Marvell. I think it -- and I was reflecting back, looking at where we were back, let's say, in 2020, during the pandemic, we were in the process of combining with Inphi and I sort of look a few years later, and I think in fiscal 2023, we -- ourselves, Inphi and also, by the way, the Innovium team we brought in, really everybody executed extremely well. It was very, very strong growth, very strong margins, great growth overall. Certainly, we're going through, now after several years of extremely strong growth, a correction in inventory, that's more pronounced in some markets than others. We're managing through that very prudently and expeditiously and doing that also in a partnership model with our customers, to where we're trying to understand their real demand and get back to a point where we're shipping back to real demand. At this point, we believe we're shipping below consumption of Marvell products. And so, we want to get back there. And when we do that, it will also lead to the increase in recovery back in the gross margin profile. And then we can have all of our new wins that we've gotten and all the hard work, our sales team, business unit team has done over the last few years, driving our design win funnel to recognize that growth. So, I'd say, despite the short-term issues, we think very long term at Marvell, okay? I mean, I'm entering my seventh year as -- actually, about to complete my seventh year as CEO. The prospects for this company are tremendous. We have conviction in our end markets and the long-term opportunity. And the R&D investment that's needed to really execute the programs our customers want to is right in front of us. We have an opportunity, I think, to really reassess and make sure that we're focused and laser focused on the best opportunities. I think we've made capital allocation from day one, a strategic priority for Marvell. And I believe, we can come through this cycle much -- as a much stronger company with our growth prospects intact and actually have a better long-term opportunity doing really key programs for our customers with the best ROI. So we're going through that whole process now, as we do always, and I feel very good about the future of the company. So appreciate the time today, everybody, and look forward to catching up post earnings."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note this event is being recorded.  I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. \nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's third quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO. Let me remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Marvell team drove revenue to $1.54 billion, a record for the company, growing 27% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. This year-over-year growth was driven by our cloud, 5G and auto business as well as share and content gains in our enterprise networking end market. Our third quarter revenue came in towards the lower end of our guidance range, and we are forecasting a sequential decline in our fourth quarter. Early in the third quarter, we were still dealing with supply escalations. Late in the quarter, customers started requesting to push out shipments and reschedule orders to manage their inventory in a changing demand environment. In the third quarter, these inventory reductions started to manifest and we are expecting an even greater impact in the fourth quarter. The largest impact is from our storage customers and has been widely communicated by that set of OEMs. In addition, as our Chinese customers deal with a changing macroeconomic situation, their demand for our products has come down significantly. Just to give you a sense of the magnitude of that change, we estimate that our revenue in the fourth quarter from our OEM customers based in China will decrease by over 1/3 compared to the second quarter. We expect revenue from China OEMs will account for less than 10% of our total company revenue in the fourth quarter. I would note that to date, the restrictions of the U.S. Department of Commerce announced in October on shipments of U.S. chip technology to China has not meaningfully impacted our revenue. While the inventory correction at our customers is challenging in the near term, we believe it's prudent to work closely with them to manage the change in an orderly fashion and clear the path to a resumption of growth. Let me now move on to discussing our end markets, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the third quarter was $627 million, exceeding guidance with better-than-expected results from our cloud business. On a year-on-year basis, our data center revenue grew 26% with our cloud business driving all the growth with multiple product lines contributing to strong results. On a sequential basis, our data center revenue declined by 3% due to softness in our on-premise business. Our storage products, including fiber channel, HDD and SSD, all saw demand decline during the quarter. However, our cloud business continued to grow sequentially, driven by strength in our electro-optics and switch products.  We are seeing the growth rate of the data center end market decelerate and customers have started adjusting their inventory to address the changing demand picture. As a result, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting our data center revenue to decline year-over-year approximately in the mid- to high teens on a percentage basis and sequentially decline in the mid-20% range. The biggest change in demand is in product lines where we are one step removed from the end customer. So when demand changes quickly, we are more exposed to the supply chain bullwhip effect. As a result, we expect the impact to be the most pronounced in our storage business, which we project will be responsible for the bulk of the overall sequential decline in our data center revenue. In particular, we are projecting a very large reduction in shipments of our HDD controllers and preamps, as HDD OEMs deal with a broad-based inventory correction. The rest of our data center business is also expected to deal with inventory adjustments by our customers but to a much lesser extent compared to our storage business. While we work through the near-term situation in the data center end market, we remain confident in our multiple long-term growth drivers. In the third quarter, we started ramping our cloud optimized silicon design wins into production and are planning to launch multiple additional products in fiscal year 2024 and 2025. Our successful execution on the first group of projects, coupled with our ongoing investments in data infrastructure, silicon IP and advanced process and packaging technologies is opening up an even larger set of opportunities with cloud customers. In the third quarter, we launched our next-generation cloud security solution, Marvell's LiquidSecurity 2 HSM adapter, the industry's most advanced solution for enabling encryption, key management and authentication in the cloud. Powered by Marvell's cloud optimized OCTEON DPU, LS 2 is a converged security platform for payment, privacy compliance and general purpose applications. We are also making progress on two of our longer-term growth initiatives in the cloud, CXL and ADCs. In the third quarter, we announced availability of our CXL development platform for cloud data center operators and server OEMs, enabling two key use cases: memory expansion and memory pooling. The platform pairs Marvell's advanced CXL technology with the latest CXL capable CPUs, including the new fourth-gen AMD EPYC processors demonstrating multi-host memory pooling. With this platform, cloud operators can begin to advance their infrastructure and enable their applications to take advantage of this cutting-edge technology. I'm very excited to announce that we have recently won a significant design at a Tier 1 hyperscaler projected to drive a substantial amount of revenue in aggregate over the program's lifetime. Product development activities are in full swing, and our team is driving a large and growing pipeline of CXL opportunities. In the AC market, multiple cable manufacturers have started sampling 100-gig per lane active electrical cables powered by Marvell PAM4 DSPs to cloud data center operators, which we expect to pave the way to broader adoption and expand our addressable market. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue was $271 million, growing 26% year-over-year and declining 5% sequentially. On a year-on-year basis, the vast majority of our growth was driven by our wireless business, which continued to benefit from the growth in 5G adoption. As you recall, the annualized revenue run rate for our wireless business crossed $600 million in the second quarter of this fiscal year. We are excited to see growth continue from that milestone. Our wired business also grew year-on-year in the third quarter driven by solid demand from metro and long-haul carrier for our market-leading coherent DSPs and accompanying TIAs and drivers. On a sequential basis, our wired business came down as expected from a very strong second quarter and more than offset growth from our wireless business. We are excited to see our 5G business continuing to flourish and are looking forward to broader deployment of 5G in multiple geographies, including the U.S., Europe and India. In addition, we anticipate significant share in content growth ahead and new opportunities in ORAN and DRAM architectures.  As you will recall, in March 2020, Nokia and Marvell announced that our companies have started working together to develop a leading 5G silicon including multiple generations of custom silicon and infrastructure processors to further expand the range of Nokia's ReefShark chipsets. Earlier this week, we announced an extension of our collaboration with Nokia to further advance their 5G chipset portfolio. Nokia will be using our new OCTEON 10 DPU, the industry's leading 5G transport processor built on Marvell's cutting-edge 5-nanometer platform and hardware acceleration technology. These high-performance and highly efficient processors will allow operators to scale rapidly and manage the dramatic increase in data traffic and performance demanded by 5G's innovative service-based architecture while reducing cost and energy consumption. We continue to expand our collaboration with Nokia and look forward to enabling their next-generation 5G platforms. There are also two key announcements from the Open RAN ecosystem. Vodafone and Nokia announced that they have agreed to work on a fully compliant Open RAN solution with Marvell. Developing cooperation with us, Nokia's ReefShark SoC boosts Layer-1 processing capability to enable Open RAN systems to reach full functionality and performance parity with traditional mobile radio networks. In another development, Vodafone and Samsung recently announced that they are jointly cooperating with Marvell to accelerate the performance and adoption of 5G Open RAN across Europe. They plan on incorporating Marvell's advanced OCTEON Fusion processor specifically designed for Open RAN into the latest off-the-shelf servers. The specialized accelerator chip also enables massive MIMO technology developed to serve many subscribers in dense urban areas. Moving on to our outlook for next quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting revenue from our carrier end market to grow slightly on a sequential basis and grow year-over-year approximately in the mid-teens on a percentage basis. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $376 million, growing 52% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. As the quarter progressed, our Chinese customers started to turn cautious due to an evolving macroeconomic environment. In response, we work with customers realigning shipments to reflect their reduced demand. As a result, despite the strong sequential and year-over-year growth, revenue was lower than our guidance. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting revenue from the enterprise networking end market to decline sequentially in the low single digits on a percentage basis. However, we expect growth to continue year-over-year at close to 40%, reflecting our higher content and growing share. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $84 million, growing 26% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Revenue was lower than our forecast in industrial as well as automotive where we continue to experience supply challenges in certain legacy notes. We expect these supply challenges to start to improve in our fourth quarter. On a sequential basis, our auto business continued to grow, partially offset by a decline in our industrial business. On a year-over-year basis in this end market, Marvell's growth was primarily from our auto business, driven by continuing adoption of our Ethernet technology. Our auto business achieved another milestone in the third quarter with annualized revenues exceeding $200 million. As you recall, we have been accumulating platform design wins across a broad spectrum of auto OEMs. And we have generated a substantial pipeline of lifetime revenue that will benefit us over many years. Looking to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are projecting strong growth for our overall auto and industrial end market, expecting revenue to grow approximately 30% year-over-year and in the mid-20% range sequentially. Moving to our consumer end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $178 million, declining 2% year-over-year and growing 9% sequentially. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are forecasting revenue to be flat sequentially and decline in the low to mid-single digits year-over-year on a percentage basis. In summary, Marvell delivered record results in the third quarter despite the macroeconomic uncertainty in the world and inventory corrections in some of our end markets. Taking stock of our progress this fiscal year, at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, we are projecting full fiscal year revenue growth in the low 30% range. While we are not immune to the global slowdown impacting the semiconductor sector, we expect to finish this year growing revenue well above the industry and our long-term model, reflecting our continued focus on data infrastructure. Looking forward to the next fiscal year, we remain confident in our key growth drivers of cloud, 5G and auto. We expect that our cloud optimized silicon programs will build from the initial ramp that started in the second half of this fiscal year and continue to grow approximately $400 million in aggregate revenue in fiscal 2024 and $800 million in fiscal 2025. Our cloud customers are relying on these chips to build incredibly efficient and optimized custom hardware to enable their key growth drivers. In addition to our cloud optimized programs, we expect that our 5G products in our automotive business will drive strong year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2024. Offsetting this growth to an extent, we expect a few quarters of inventory adjustments in some of our businesses as customers realign their demand. We continue to be disciplined on operating expenses. We have tightened spending and slowed our pace of hiring, focusing on critical hires for future success. At the same time, we continue to invest in our long-term growth initiatives including our 3-nanometer silicon platform, which is now available for new product designs. In addition, we are committed to executing on a number of new products, which our customers have designed into their mission-critical applications. Over the last few years, we have significantly transformed the company, creating a diversified business with growing exposure to multiple infrastructure end markets with strong secular growth drivers. Our businesses at scale, we have a growing design win funnel, leadership products and strong customer engagement. We've built an extraordinary team at Marvell with a track record of execution excellence, and we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current environment to continue to deliver strong top and bottom line results over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nJean Hu: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue in the third quarter was $1.537 billion, within our guidance range, growing 1% sequentially and 27% year-over-year, driven by growth from our data infrastructure end market. Data center accounted for 41% of revenue, enterprise networking was 24% of revenue, carrier infrastructure at 18%, consumer at 12% and auto industrial at 5%. GAAP gross margin was 50.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64% of revenue, below our guidance range primarily due to product mix. Our enterprise and auto industrial end market revenue was lower than expected, and the consumer revenue was higher than our forecast. GAAP operating expenses were $672 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $420 million, declining by 3% sequentially. Year-over-year, OpEx increased by 13%, growing at less than half the rate of the top line revenue growth. OpEx was lower than guidance due to lower bonus accrual and better-than-expected NRE. Our GAAP operating income was $106 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $564 million or 36.7% of revenue, another all-time record, demonstrating the strong leverage in our operating model. Other income expense, including interest on our debt was $41 million, higher than guidance primarily due to higher interest rate on our outstanding debt. For the third quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $0.02. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.57 within our guidance range. Earnings per share grew 33% year-over-year faster than top line revenue growth. Now turning to our balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $411 million in cash from operations, reflecting our strong earnings offset by continued working capital investments to support our top line revenue growth, including $94 million in payments for long-term back-end and substrate capacity agreements. These agreements are critical to ramping our complex products in data infrastructure market including the call to optimize the silicon solutions Matt discussed earlier. In the third quarter, we increased our inventory by $44 million or 5% sequentially. Looking at the change in demand we are forecasting in the fourth quarter, we expect our inventory level to continue to be elevated. We are focused on prioritizing new product ramps to support our customers. These -- most of our products have long product cycles of three to five years or even longer. We are comfortable carrying higher inventory in a dynamic supply chain environment and we plan on reducing inventory starting next fiscal year. As of the end of the third fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalent was $723 million increasing by $106 million from the prior quarter. Our total debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9x and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. During the third quarter, we returned $101 million to shareholders through $51 million in cash dividends and $50 million of share repurchases. In summary, in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Marvell team executed very well, delivering top line revenue growth and earnings expansion much faster than revenue growth. Now turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.4 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin in the range of 48.2% to 50.2%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 64%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $646 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million. As Matt mentioned earlier, we have proactively slowed down our pace of hiring and tightened the discretionary spending to manage our operating expenses. We have a proven track record of executing through economic and the market cycles to maintain strong profitability while we continue to invest in long-term growth initiatives. As a reminder, looking ahead to the first fiscal quarter of 2024, due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes and employee merit increase, our OpEx tends to increase from the fourth fiscal quarter in the high single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. Following the step-up in the first fiscal quarter, we are currently planning on holding our OpEx approximately flat at that level for the next few quarters. Other income and expense, including interest on our debt is expected to be approximately $44 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 6% for the fourth quarter and currently expect this to increase slightly to 7% next fiscal year. We expect our basic weighted share outstanding will be 855 million. And our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 861 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of breakeven to $0.05 per diluted share. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.46, plus or minus $0.05. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Blayne Curtis with Barclays.\nBlayne Curtis : Matt, maybe just on the data center, I want to understand the moving pieces a little bit better. I think storage has been weak for a bit. I think nearline, I think you've been pretty open that, that was weak. I guess it's implied a big move in storage. And I guess what I'm struggling with is trying to figure out how to put the comment on the Chinese weakness as well because that's a big number. And I guess maybe that overlaps. So can you just parse those two pieces a little bit more for me? What -- when you say China is weak, what kind of products are we talking about? Is there a way you kind of give any better color on that within the data center for January?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Got you, Blayne. Yes. So on the first one on nearline, as you mentioned, there's been a lot of reports out there about the weakness there. We really hadn't seen that when we guided the quarter. In Q3, we started to see some weakness, but the impact is very pronounced in the fourth quarter, and that nearline weakness obviously flows into the data center end market into that bucket. When you go to China and the weakness we've seen there, that's really in the enterprise area. So while overall enterprise is hanging in there, it was slightly below in Q3. We've had some offsets to that from strength elsewhere. But the main impact of the Chinese customers has really been in enterprise for the most part.\nBlayne Curtis : And then if I could just follow up. You mentioned in terms of the cloud, you said it was actually strong in October, both optical as well as switching. I'm kind of -- but you also made a comment that I think data center is decelerating. So can you just put those two together? Are you still seeing strength in U.S. cloud and weakness elsewhere? Does the comment on data center weakening just on-prem? What did you mean by that?\nMatt Murphy : Yes. Great question. So let me take it from the top. So first point would be that if you look over the last few years, cloud CapEx has been on fire. It's been growing 30% kind of plus for the last few years. This year, if you look at reports and kind of what we see is probably something in the 15% range for '22 and then it depends on who you talk to, but probably down in the low to mid-single digits or maybe mid-single digits for next year. So that's the deceleration that we're talking about. And as the macro has started to catch up even with these large cloud companies, you see them very publicly tightening their CapEx, tightening their OpEx. And they've had this supply chain built in the data center, which was geared up for a lot of growth. And so as they reset those expectations, it's not a real smooth process. Storage is the most pronounced, as I mentioned earlier. That's the majority reason code for the sequential decline. But we are seeing inventory adjustment as well to a much lesser extent, and I'd say the broader set of product lines outside of storage that we sell into data center. And so that is not a China-specific thing. That is a global comment, including U.S. cloud, seeing inventory adjustment a bit more broadly. And that's a change, certainly from where we were, say, a quarter ago when we were mired in supply escalations and expedites to an environment where it's now how do we work together to manage the inventory and manage the new reality. And so that's what you see in the guide for Q4. Hopefully, that was helpful to give you the perspective you're looking for.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Matt, I'm trying to see what is the range of kind of scenarios for fiscal '24 sales growth? I understand you're not giving a specific number. It would be helpful if you give us at least kind of a range. Can Marvell grow next year? Because when I look at the three areas, cloud and 5G, and autos, I believe it's about 35%, 40% of business. Can those three areas collectively grow fast enough to offset the inventory correction in other areas? Like, so should we be thinking about flat or mid-single digit? What's the kind of range of scenarios of growth that we should be thinking about for fiscal '24?\nMatt Murphy : Yes. Great question, Vivek. And certainly, I'd frame all this by saying it's still a very dynamic environment. So we'll give you the best view we can. I'd say the first point is we feel very good about the new products that are ramping up and the growth drivers that we've articulated, whether it's cloud optimized silicon, switching, electro-optics, things like that in the data center, 5G, obviously, continued momentum there with additional regions like India ramping next year plus content gain rolling through and then automotive continuing to grow. So those are all the positives. What we don't know completely, but I'll give you the best color I can is on the base business and how much of the inventory correction we're going to be dealing with and the magnitude of that. We anticipate, first of all, that that's like typical cycles. It's probably a couple of quarters to work its way through. And the three areas I would call out that probably are some offsets next year are, one, would be in consumer. That's an area where we just haven't put a lot of investment. We've been typically running that business for cash. You'll probably see some decline there. I think on-premise data center is another area. The on-prem stuff probably has work to do next year. And then maybe a little bit in our wired infrastructure business. If you look, actually, it's kind of interesting, if you go back to our fiscal '22 and you look at those three areas, they all grew pretty dramatically in fiscal '23, the current year we're in. And so at a high level, I think some of those are probably going to trend back to where they were before this big up cycle. And again, from a sort of a timing perspective, think of it as a lot of that headwind or weakness more in the first half, inventory works itself through, and then you have growth back off of that, plus you have the growth drivers kicking in. So I think it's a very different story, most likely first half versus second half. But those are some of the moving pieces in terms of how you think about the growth drivers versus some of the offsets. But we do see -- we still believe we can drive positive year-over-year growth. It just certainly isn't going to be as high as we had been hoping for if you went back even three months ago, just given the magnitude of some of the inventory adjustments.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS.\nTimothy Arcuri : Matt, just along the same lines of that question. I'm just kind of wondering, if you can help us figure out what a reasonable baseline is in the data center business headed into next year? If you look at storage, I mean, it must be down about 50% sequentially in January, and you were obviously over-shipping the past few quarters and you're really under-shipping now. But it seems like if you net all that out, maybe it's kind of the $600 million per quarter baseline in data center and then you can add the $400 million for the cloud optimized silicon next year. Can you sort of help us handicap what a normalized run rate might be in that business?\nMatt Murphy : Yes. First, I think you're in the ballpark on storage. And just for a little context, the magnitude of that decline, we can't find a data point that shows it declining that quickly. Even when we look back to the reset in 2019, this is down a lot more than that in the same time frame. So you're right, a lot has come out, and so that needs to normalize. I think you've probably got the math about right if you think about sort of where is the base business at. But just to be clear, we're still in a little bit of a dynamic environment figuring out where this is going to bottom out. But if you look at how fast it's coming down, and that's kind of what we're doing, by the way, we're effectively working with our customers to make sure we deal with this quickly and efficiently and minimize any risk of building excess inventory. And that's the path we're on. So sometime in the Q4, Q1 timeframe, we think that works itself through, and then you start to kind of grow from there. But that's probably reasonable. Probably is an annualized type of run rate, maybe a little bit lower in the first half and certainly higher in the second half as the new designs really ramp up.\nTimothy Arcuri : Yes, got it. I guess just maybe trying to -- I was just trying to get -- to hold people's hands a little bit on the non-storage stuff because people will say, well, the issue is not just storage. The issue is the other stuff, too, but it sounds like it's not.\nMatt Murphy : It's -- there is some. I mean, just to be very, very clear, right? The major reason code for the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 in the data center line is storage, but there is inventory adjustment going on in digestion given that slope of the CapEx curve has just come down. There is some realignment. But that is not as pronounced, and it's very manageable. But I just -- I want to be very clear, it's not 100% storage issue. There's just a broader digestion.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.\nToshiya Hari : Matt, if we take your guidance for the carrier infrastructure business in Q4, I think you'll be doing about $1.1 billion in revenue in the full year, maybe a little bit below that. To level set us, how much of that is wireless? How much of that is wired? And as you look forward into fiscal year '24, how are you thinking about the 5G business? I think the market, overall, you're seeing some spots of softness potentially, but obviously, you've got idiosyncratic design wins. So how are you thinking about your business there? And then on the wired side, just given the cyclical dynamics, what sort of decline should we be expecting into fiscal '24?\nJean Hu : Toshiya, this is Jean. I'll start to answer this question, and then Matt can add. So first, on the carrier infrastructure, wireless is already more than half. We talk about the wireless revenues already running, had more than $600 million annualized run rate. So wireless is definitely small than half. Going into next year, as Matt mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong 5G adoption and our customers continue to do very well in the marketplace. So we do expect the wireless part of the business will continue to have a very strong growth into next year. Of course, the wireline side is what Matt discussed. We are going to see some headwinds on wireline side. But overall, we do expect the carrier infrastructure to continue to grow. Matt, anything you want to add?\nMatt Murphy : No, I think that was perfect. I mean I just put a pin on it that the wireless opportunity continues to be very exciting, and I think it's going to be a very good year for wireless next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas.\nKarl Ackerman : Two questions, if I may. Matt or Jean, I wanted to first discuss enterprise networking. You spoke about how China impacts that a little bit. But ex-China, are you still seeing growth? And I know some of your networking OEMs have spoken about some moderating orders. But I think last quarter, you said that this segment was an area that was most constrained. And so I want to get -- clarify if that's still true. And if you could kind of tie in the amount of inventory that some of those customers have to get a better sense of the demand dynamic of enterprise networking going into fiscal '24?\nMatt Murphy : Sure. I'll make a few comments. And then, Jean, why don't you add as well. Yes, a couple of things are going on. One is the supply environment has definitely improved. Now some of that is because of the weakness in the China market that's opened up supply, we can give to other customers. Because generally, outside of a few select cases, our enterprise business is mostly merchant products. These would be Ethernet switches, gigabit, multi-gigabit PHYs, embedded processors, Karl, things like that. So when you would have a demand softness in 1 region, that helps thing. So the supply situation has improved, which is a good thing. We do have some of our own growth drivers as well. We've highlighted this over the last few quarters. We have some new custom silicon wins that are ramping up. That's offsetting some of that weakness as well. But in general, the non-China piece has done okay. It probably -- we're being cautious about how we think about it for next year. So I think the run rate that we've guided to in Q4 is probably a safe run rate to think about for next year. Even if there's a little bit of weakness or there is some inventory digestion that goes on. We do have content gains still rolling through. And so those are some of the moving pieces. You basically have China going down, U.S. customers where we've got either new design wins or share gain or content gain. And so it sort of all aligns to the numbers where we've guided for Q4. Jean, anything you want to add?\nJean Hu : No.\nKarl Ackerman : Got it. No, that's helpful, Matt. Maybe just as a quick follow-up. I was wondering as you think about some of the inventory digestion that needs to occur across some end markets, as you contemplate that and plan with your foundry suppliers for next year, is there -- could you just maybe just talk about some of the discussions you're having in terms of the ability to perhaps limit some of the cost inflation from the foundry side and whether that -- if they can share that cost with you going forward such that perhaps less of an onerous task for you to pass it along to your end customers.\nMatt Murphy : Yes. I would say if you -- without getting into the specifics of each of the input costs that we deal with, I would say that in general, with supply loosening up, that's going to be a positive. I'd say that being said, we have -- there are areas that are still constrained. There's still inflationary aspects inside our supply chain that sort of are coming towards us. We're doing what we can to mitigate those. And to the extent we can't mitigate those. We're going to continue to do what we've been doing for the last few years, which is basically pass it on in a generally margin-neutral type of manner. And we found a way to do that, and we'll continue to do that. But certainly, the Marvell team and the operations team has worked aggressively over the last few years, particularly on the packaging back end, et cetera, to enable more sources to set up more strategic agreements. And so we're kind of working on both sides. One is to just do our job as a good supplier and manage the cost base. But to the extent we can't, there will be probably a little bit of inflation still in the system. That's sort of how we're looking at it. We formed really strategic partnerships with these companies. We have a very transparent communication with them on the demand environment. And I'd say that we're counting on them to work with us as partners as we manage through what looks like an overall semiconductor down cycle.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.\nGary Mobley : I had a question that kind of picks up on the last topic, and that is your purchase obligations. I know you haven't filed your 10-Q yet, but as I looked at the last your purchase obligations are expected to be about 25% of your cost of goods sold next year. And so given the current market softness, do you anticipate being able to utilize all that? Do you anticipate the possibility of any sort of inventory write-down?\nJean Hu : Gary, this is Jean. Thank you for the question. So yes, the purchasing obligation we have this quarter will not change much from the last 10-Q we filed. It's about $3.2 billion. But just remember, those purchase agreement, it's really for long term. On average, it's between four to 10 years. And also, our products are very complex and a lot of them have a very long manufacturing cycle. So we actually need a dedicated capacity for those complex products to support our customers, single cells, the customer, large volume, last long time. Regardless of the economic environment, we need those dedicated capacity. And frankly, our team has been very thoughtful. We only secure the capacity largely in back end and the substrate for portion of what we need. So we feel quite comfortable. We don't have the issues on the purchase agreement obligations or have to write off any capacity. That's not something we anticipate at all.\nMatt Murphy : Yes. Gary, I would just add, I'd say that if you look at the bundle of the different obligations we have, some of them are in the shorter term, which are in the form of things like prepays and others where as we take the capacity, we actually get it back. The LTA, take-or-pay portion is actually not very large relative to the total. And as Jean said, the most strategic aspect of this is really in the most advanced technologies, especially in complex substrates and high-end packaging, which we absolutely need to secure because of the volume that we're going to be ramping in the next few years. I mean just take the -- as one example, the $800 million of incremental cloud-optimized silicon wins. That all is 5-nanometer technology using advanced ABS substrates, very customized packaging. Those agreements to get that capacity from really the best vendors, you need to put that in place literally years in advance. And so we've done those types of things, and we feel good about that because they're tied directly to committed programs. So as Jean said, overall, while we have obligations, we think they're actually a benefit to us, and it certainly helps us underwrite our future success. And we're able to send a strong message to our customers about how we're able to provide the necessary capacity and supply chain for them -- for their future.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore : I guess kind of a two-parter going back to the data center side, Matt. Could you just level set us, what percentage of the third quarter data center business was storage? And then looking forward on the more kind of constructive side of things, what's your confidence level on that $400 million in incremental cloud optimized revenue growth next year? Given the fact that you talked about a deceleration in what's happening at the cloud customers themselves, are you at all worried about that $400 million being something less than that or being pushed out? Is that at all a level of conservatism that we should consider?\nMatt Murphy : Sure. Yes. Let me answer the second one first. The answer is we feel very good about that revenue stream. Part of it is, if you remember, Ross, we went from talking about the $400 million and $800 million to actually talking about, call it, $400-plus million $800-plus million because we had gotten additional design wins that created a little bit of a buffer as well because I think even if we hedge it for next year and the volumes don't quite achieve what we would have thought, we actually had one additional business that gives us some comfort around that. So -- but I would say all the programs are on track. We are fortunate that despite the changing environment, I would say we are absolutely head down in trying to take out multiple new products right now that need to ramp up in very significant volume next year. And I'm personally involved in these with our customers to ensure we're meeting their schedule, and we're doing everything possible to get there. So that's the good news that the programs are still on track. And I think that's a good thing. The percentage -- I think your other question was what was the percentage of data center revenue that's in storage?\nRoss Seymore : Other way around, if storage falling is the headwind for data center, just to level set people, you had 30% roughly of your business in storage or in data center?\nJean Hu : Yes, Ross, maybe I can help you. Yes, I can help you with that. In general, the way to think about this, our storage business, it's probably about 1/3 of the data center -- total data center business; average, right, not a particular quarter. But of course, when we go through the inventory correction, as Matt mentioned earlier, that's going to be the largest drop piece for the inventory correction.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur : Matt, you talked about the impact on a more muted cloud CapEx spend on your overall data center business. Most pronounced in storage, but you do have compute, you've got networking, you've got optical products as well. And looking specifically at your cloud optical connectivity segment, which obviously is PAM4 DSP, your color solution. If I look back at the last cloud spending slowdown, which was in 2019, both of these segments combined grew about 35%, 40%, right? Granted, this was still in the early innings of the 200, 400 gig upgrade cycle. But part of it is also very strategic in nature because your customers are still trying to enable better performance through higher networking speeds. So I guess kind of two questions. Near term, is the team dealing with inventory issues in these particular optical products? And then looking into next year and the team see continued growth in cloud optical?\nMatt Murphy : Yes. Great. Thanks, Harlan, for the question. And you're right, it is a little bit of a different situation than a few years ago where that was fairly nascent technology, really ramping up hard in an inflection curve. That being said, we still see strong adoption of 800 gig. We've seen strong momentum in 400ZR in the new platform. We -- and we expect that overall optics is going to grow next year. That being said, I would say in the fourth quarter, part of the adjustment would be in that area. But I think that's a shorter-term thing. And again, because to your point, it's so strategic, we anticipate that optics is going to continue to grow. And by the way, we're heads down on new product development there as well because for the next generation of high-end 51.2T switches, you're going to need the associated optics with that, which then moves from 800 gigabits per second to 1.6 terabits per second. And so that's an ongoing new product development activity we have. So lots of activity in that area. Super exciting, but it's a little bit of a different environment than 2019 just because there has been more broad adoption, but we do feel good about it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore.\nC.J. Muse: I guess, Matt, I was hoping to spend a little bit of time on the enterprise networking side of the house, roughly $1.4 billion business for the fiscal year. And you talked about a China slowdown. Is there a way to kind of parse between China and non-China and how you're thinking about the trajectory into January and all of calendar '23?\nMatt Murphy : Yes, that's a good question. The -- as we indicated, china is down a lot, right, in Q4 from where it was just two quarters ago. That may end up being a little bit a little bit of an overcorrection. It's hard to tell, quite frankly, on what's going on there and how long that's going to last and how that ripples through. The non-China has been holding up very well. Again, I'd say based on the content gains we have as well as the -- just the new products that are ramping up with higher ASPs. And so that's sort of offsetting it to some extent. What we are guiding for Q4, enterprise networking overall, it's still down just because of the China factor. But I'd say if I had to handicap it for next year, non-China will be a bigger percentage of the total in fiscal '24 than China. But I don't have the exact numbers at the tip of my fingers here. A lot of this goes through the channel and other -- it's -- yes, I just don't have those numbers in front of me.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.\nChristopher Rolland : I wanted to follow up on carrier infrastructure as well. So a couple of things. I guess, first of all, your agreement with Nokia and the extension there. I was wondering if there's any economics associated with that? And then secondly, looking out into next year, there's a lot more talk about India, 5G, Nokia winning, Samsung winning there as well. What does the opportunity look like there for growth? Is this going to be sizable overall?\nMatt Murphy : Yes. Thanks, Chris. On the Nokia front, again, it was great to see us being able to announce with them our Layer-2 transport processor. Recall the initial engagement with them, which was very successful, and it's great to see how well they did was on the Layer-1 baseband processor. And that -- I think that partnership has led to now a broader engagement. And so as you probably know, you followed the space, the Layer-2 transport or CPU is a critical component, right, with fairly meaningful content as you sort of roll forward. So I think that's all very positive. And on India, that -- they seem to be gearing up for a very aggressive rollout next year. And I think, to your point, a few of our key customers are well positioned to take advantage of that ramp. And so that's why we said earlier, we feel really good about wireless next year, I think both on sort of our content gains as well as our -- but probably even more the regional deployments. And I think India probably will be sizable would be my guess.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.\nTore Svanberg : Yes. And if you don't mind, I'm going to ask a question that's not related to the next two quarters. So -- and it does have two parts. So first of all, the UCI-Express standard, is that something that could potentially accelerate the adoption of CXL. The reason I'm asking is because last time on the call, you talked about maybe CXL not contributing to revenues probably for the few years, but there does seem to be a lot of activity here that could potentially pull that timeline in a little bit.\nMatt Murphy : Yes. I think the CXL timing, a lot of that is going to be gated tory by the server CPU cycle. And I think companies are gearing up for that. It may have gotten lost in the noise, but we did call out and I called out in my prepared remarks that we had received a pretty significant design win in this area, which we're now well underway in terms of product development. So -- and then I'd say there's a very large pipeline of semi-custom products behind that as well as a merchant product. So I think that activity is still -- level of activity is very high with our customers. But I wouldn't -- I don't have visibility to any sort of change in terms of when those products would ramp necessarily. But it's a very strategic new area for us. And I'd say we continue to be focused on building a leadership position there. A lot of these products, especially as you get into the larger pooling devices, accelerators, these are, in some cases, have multicore CPU. They're in 5-nanometer. They have security features. There's quite a few things that we're adding. And so these are looking more and more like very customized SoCs, which then enable these customers to really take advantage of completely new architectures relative to how they interface their CPU, GPU, XPU whatever you want to call it, ASIC with memory. And so I think that's going to continue to be a very strategic area of focus. And getting a large win committed and underway is a really good thing.\nTore Svanberg : Great. And the second part of the question was related to your new product, and you did mention this earlier. So AEC, when should we expect Marvell to get some revenue contribution from AEC? Is that also sort of a few years out? Or could you already start to see some revenues next year?\nMatt Murphy : I think we need to let that one play out a little bit, Tore. We're taking that one step at a time. I think the milestone really was lining over the last year, really getting our solution designed in across a broad array of high-volume proven cable suppliers to the largest hyperscale companies, and we've done a great job there. And we've now started sampling those, and we have a very high level of interest. But at this juncture, we haven't really sized exactly our opportunity and the timing. But we'll do that in due course as we get better visibility to the take up of our customers that are competing in this market. But that trend is very real. The AEC trend is anyway. And we hope to be an important part of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.\nAmbrish Srivastava : I just wanted to come back to the clarification for Jean. Looking at the data center business and the storage component in the last quarter that you reported that segment before changing the reporting, I see $300 million without Inphi and then you had given a number of $340 million with Inphi. And the number you just cited, a 1/3 of the recent quarter, it seems really low. I would mean $190 million, $200 million number rounding up. Is there something I'm missing there or a large chunk of that is now in some other business?\nJean Hu : Yes. Yes. Maybe let me just recap and clarify. I think before we change the reporting, our storage business annualized run rate is about $1.4 billion. So that's what you are mentioning before we change the reporting by end market. That's what our overall storage business. Just as a reminder, it includes flash controller preamp and also fiber channel. So it's all the different storage product lines included there. And over time, the storage has come down. The number I mentioned, 1/3 is not a particular last quarter. It's more generally, when you look at several quarters, on average, it's 1/3. The first half definitely is much higher and now it's much lower, right? When you think about $1.4 billion storage revenue I'm talking about, about 60% is in data center. That's what we told investors during our Investor Day. So hope that's how you clarify different pieces.\nAmbrish Srivastava : Yes. No, it does. So that means it's come down from $1.4 billion annual run rate to $800 million, right?\nJean Hu : I don't think the way you can think about that. It's $1.4 billion. The first half of this year, it probably was much higher than $1.4 billion annualized run rate. And now it's dropping much lower, right? The second half of the run rate probably is very low. Yes.\nAmbrish Srivastava : Got it. Okay. Okay. That is very helpful. Then I had a follow-up for you, Matt. Looking at storage, and I don't follow the distrib guys, but Seagate consensus has been down three quarters in a row WD, two quarters for the mass storage business. And then you throw in the bullwhip effect. So you're seeing a much bigger impact than consensus has those guys modeled. Is that the right way in terms of timing a couple of quarters before this business comes back? And then the other businesses within data center that thanks for the clarification earlier when it is not just storage. When do those businesses -- because that magnitude is less, right, in terms of no real bullwhip effect yet. So if you combine all that, should we be modeling past December, a couple of quarters of sequential declines?\nMatt Murphy : Yes. So let me break that into two pieces. I think you absolutely nailed it when you talked about the end customer kind of dynamics and their trajectory versus ours, that is exactly the bullwhip effect. I mean you could actually just draw the bullwhip and you can kind of slap where we would be on that. And that's why -- and we've seen this historically in any business where you're kind of one additional step removed, you tend to have more volatility, right? It's just the way it works. So that, I think, you can expect. And again, we don't know exactly, but we anticipate just on past experience, it's probably a couple of quarters to work through that. And then on the other piece, which was the non-storage piece, yes, it's inventory digestion. I mean we've kind of taken a view, Ambrish, which is -- and I've been through different scenarios in my career here on how you manage when volume -- when demand drops and you can kind of work with people and manage a soft landing or you can keep shipping and then you pay the price later in a very hard way. And so our view has been, let's get through this and get it behind us. And also get to a point where as you can -- as you get your visibility up and inventory goes down and lead times turn to normal, your forecast accuracy improves. I mean I think you know that old that as well. The worst forecast you're going to get is if somebody gives you 52 weeks of orders, you're actually better off having a more normalized environment.  So that's really what we're striving to do there. And so while there is some inventory adjustment, it's fairly normal given the shift in slope in the CapEx trajectory. And we have new products ramping. And so that probably works its way through fairly quickly as well. But we'll have to see the exact timeframe. Like I said, it's still a little bit of a dynamic environment.\nMatt Murphy : Ashish, do we have time for one more? Should I just wrap it up with some closing comments?\nAshish Saran: Yes. Go ahead, wrap it up, Matt.\nMatt Murphy : Perfect. Yes. Well, thanks, everybody, for all the questions. Just a little bit of a few comments as we close here. Look, first, I think Q3 was a great quarter for us. I mean we're in the middle of a pretty severe macroeconomic environment. A lot of other companies have obviously seen some of this inventory digestion and impact earlier. But in Q3, we delivered record revenue, very strong operating margins. Even if you look at the fourth quarter guide and you kind of compare our second half of this year to a year ago, we're up about 15%. And when you look at sort of the rest of the market, take sort of large digital peers, that peer group is down about 5%. So we still think even with a softer Q4 guide, we continue to perform very well from a top line perspective. I'd say also we've been disciplined on managing expenses. The pro forma FY '23 will grow about 28%. And if you look at our OpEx increase, it's about 14%. So we've been basically growing operating expenses at about half the rate of revenue growth. And we've been able to put together a world-class team as a result to execute on these massive design wins we've gotten over the last few years. And so while we're going to be disciplined in our spending, and Jean sort of gave you the model on OpEx. We feel very good about the size of the team, the resources we have and the ability to execute, which our customers are counting on. And I believe if we do that, there's even more to come. So in conclusion, we continue to have the right strategy with really strong partnerships with key customers. We think we're in the right markets. And the growth drivers of cloud, 5G wireless communications and automotive continue to be three of the largest growth opportunities in the semiconductor industry, and Marvell is extremely well positioned there. So thanks for all the questions. I'm sure we can be more helpful in the callbacks as well. There's a lot of moving pieces. But thank you so much for your time today.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Murphy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, the Marvell team drove revenue to $1.54 billion, a record for the company, growing 27% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. This year-over-year growth was driven by our cloud, 5G and auto business as well as share and content gains in our enterprise networking end market. Our third quarter revenue came in towards the lower end of our guidance range, and we are forecasting a sequential decline in our fourth quarter. Early in the third quarter, we were still dealing with supply escalations. Late in the quarter, customers started requesting to push out shipments and reschedule orders to manage their inventory in a changing demand environment. In the third quarter, these inventory reductions started to manifest and we are expecting an even greater impact in the fourth quarter. The largest impact is from our storage customers and has been widely communicated by that set of OEMs. In addition, as our Chinese customers deal with a changing macroeconomic situation, their demand for our products has come down significantly. Just to give you a sense of the magnitude of that change, we estimate that our revenue in the fourth quarter from our OEM customers based in China will decrease by over 1/3 compared to the second quarter. We expect revenue from China OEMs will account for less than 10% of our total company revenue in the fourth quarter. I would note that to date, the restrictions of the U.S. Department of Commerce announced in October on shipments of U.S. chip technology to China has not meaningfully impacted our revenue. While the inventory correction at our customers is challenging in the near term, we believe it's prudent to work closely with them to manage the change in an orderly fashion and clear the path to a resumption of growth. Let me now move on to discussing our end markets, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the third quarter was $627 million, exceeding guidance with better-than-expected results from our cloud business. On a year-on-year basis, our data center revenue grew 26% with our cloud business driving all the growth with multiple product lines contributing to strong results. On a sequential basis, our data center revenue declined by 3% due to softness in our on-premise business. Our storage products, including fiber channel, HDD and SSD, all saw demand decline during the quarter. However, our cloud business continued to grow sequentially, driven by strength in our electro-optics and switch products.  We are seeing the growth rate of the data center end market decelerate and customers have started adjusting their inventory to address the changing demand picture. As a result, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting our data center revenue to decline year-over-year approximately in the mid- to high teens on a percentage basis and sequentially decline in the mid-20% range. The biggest change in demand is in product lines where we are one step removed from the end customer. So when demand changes quickly, we are more exposed to the supply chain bullwhip effect. As a result, we expect the impact to be the most pronounced in our storage business, which we project will be responsible for the bulk of the overall sequential decline in our data center revenue. In particular, we are projecting a very large reduction in shipments of our HDD controllers and preamps, as HDD OEMs deal with a broad-based inventory correction. The rest of our data center business is also expected to deal with inventory adjustments by our customers but to a much lesser extent compared to our storage business. While we work through the near-term situation in the data center end market, we remain confident in our multiple long-term growth drivers. In the third quarter, we started ramping our cloud optimized silicon design wins into production and are planning to launch multiple additional products in fiscal year 2024 and 2025. Our successful execution on the first group of projects, coupled with our ongoing investments in data infrastructure, silicon IP and advanced process and packaging technologies is opening up an even larger set of opportunities with cloud customers. In the third quarter, we launched our next-generation cloud security solution, Marvell's LiquidSecurity 2 HSM adapter, the industry's most advanced solution for enabling encryption, key management and authentication in the cloud. Powered by Marvell's cloud optimized OCTEON DPU, LS 2 is a converged security platform for payment, privacy compliance and general purpose applications. We are also making progress on two of our longer-term growth initiatives in the cloud, CXL and ADCs. In the third quarter, we announced availability of our CXL development platform for cloud data center operators and server OEMs, enabling two key use cases: memory expansion and memory pooling. The platform pairs Marvell's advanced CXL technology with the latest CXL capable CPUs, including the new fourth-gen AMD EPYC processors demonstrating multi-host memory pooling. With this platform, cloud operators can begin to advance their infrastructure and enable their applications to take advantage of this cutting-edge technology. I'm very excited to announce that we have recently won a significant design at a Tier 1 hyperscaler projected to drive a substantial amount of revenue in aggregate over the program's lifetime. Product development activities are in full swing, and our team is driving a large and growing pipeline of CXL opportunities. In the AC market, multiple cable manufacturers have started sampling 100-gig per lane active electrical cables powered by Marvell PAM4 DSPs to cloud data center operators, which we expect to pave the way to broader adoption and expand our addressable market. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue was $271 million, growing 26% year-over-year and declining 5% sequentially. On a year-on-year basis, the vast majority of our growth was driven by our wireless business, which continued to benefit from the growth in 5G adoption. As you recall, the annualized revenue run rate for our wireless business crossed $600 million in the second quarter of this fiscal year. We are excited to see growth continue from that milestone. Our wired business also grew year-on-year in the third quarter driven by solid demand from metro and long-haul carrier for our market-leading coherent DSPs and accompanying TIAs and drivers. On a sequential basis, our wired business came down as expected from a very strong second quarter and more than offset growth from our wireless business. We are excited to see our 5G business continuing to flourish and are looking forward to broader deployment of 5G in multiple geographies, including the U.S., Europe and India. In addition, we anticipate significant share in content growth ahead and new opportunities in ORAN and DRAM architectures.  As you will recall, in March 2020, Nokia and Marvell announced that our companies have started working together to develop a leading 5G silicon including multiple generations of custom silicon and infrastructure processors to further expand the range of Nokia's ReefShark chipsets. Earlier this week, we announced an extension of our collaboration with Nokia to further advance their 5G chipset portfolio. Nokia will be using our new OCTEON 10 DPU, the industry's leading 5G transport processor built on Marvell's cutting-edge 5-nanometer platform and hardware acceleration technology. These high-performance and highly efficient processors will allow operators to scale rapidly and manage the dramatic increase in data traffic and performance demanded by 5G's innovative service-based architecture while reducing cost and energy consumption. We continue to expand our collaboration with Nokia and look forward to enabling their next-generation 5G platforms. There are also two key announcements from the Open RAN ecosystem. Vodafone and Nokia announced that they have agreed to work on a fully compliant Open RAN solution with Marvell. Developing cooperation with us, Nokia's ReefShark SoC boosts Layer-1 processing capability to enable Open RAN systems to reach full functionality and performance parity with traditional mobile radio networks. In another development, Vodafone and Samsung recently announced that they are jointly cooperating with Marvell to accelerate the performance and adoption of 5G Open RAN across Europe. They plan on incorporating Marvell's advanced OCTEON Fusion processor specifically designed for Open RAN into the latest off-the-shelf servers. The specialized accelerator chip also enables massive MIMO technology developed to serve many subscribers in dense urban areas. Moving on to our outlook for next quarter. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting revenue from our carrier end market to grow slightly on a sequential basis and grow year-over-year approximately in the mid-teens on a percentage basis. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $376 million, growing 52% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. As the quarter progressed, our Chinese customers started to turn cautious due to an evolving macroeconomic environment. In response, we work with customers realigning shipments to reflect their reduced demand. As a result, despite the strong sequential and year-over-year growth, revenue was lower than our guidance. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are expecting revenue from the enterprise networking end market to decline sequentially in the low single digits on a percentage basis. However, we expect growth to continue year-over-year at close to 40%, reflecting our higher content and growing share. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $84 million, growing 26% year-over-year and 1% sequentially. Revenue was lower than our forecast in industrial as well as automotive where we continue to experience supply challenges in certain legacy notes. We expect these supply challenges to start to improve in our fourth quarter. On a sequential basis, our auto business continued to grow, partially offset by a decline in our industrial business. On a year-over-year basis in this end market, Marvell's growth was primarily from our auto business, driven by continuing adoption of our Ethernet technology. Our auto business achieved another milestone in the third quarter with annualized revenues exceeding $200 million. As you recall, we have been accumulating platform design wins across a broad spectrum of auto OEMs. And we have generated a substantial pipeline of lifetime revenue that will benefit us over many years. Looking to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are projecting strong growth for our overall auto and industrial end market, expecting revenue to grow approximately 30% year-over-year and in the mid-20% range sequentially. Moving to our consumer end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $178 million, declining 2% year-over-year and growing 9% sequentially. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we are forecasting revenue to be flat sequentially and decline in the low to mid-single digits year-over-year on a percentage basis. In summary, Marvell delivered record results in the third quarter despite the macroeconomic uncertainty in the world and inventory corrections in some of our end markets. Taking stock of our progress this fiscal year, at the midpoint of our fourth quarter guidance, we are projecting full fiscal year revenue growth in the low 30% range. While we are not immune to the global slowdown impacting the semiconductor sector, we expect to finish this year growing revenue well above the industry and our long-term model, reflecting our continued focus on data infrastructure. Looking forward to the next fiscal year, we remain confident in our key growth drivers of cloud, 5G and auto. We expect that our cloud optimized silicon programs will build from the initial ramp that started in the second half of this fiscal year and continue to grow approximately $400 million in aggregate revenue in fiscal 2024 and $800 million in fiscal 2025. Our cloud customers are relying on these chips to build incredibly efficient and optimized custom hardware to enable their key growth drivers. In addition to our cloud optimized programs, we expect that our 5G products in our automotive business will drive strong year-over-year revenue growth in fiscal 2024. Offsetting this growth to an extent, we expect a few quarters of inventory adjustments in some of our businesses as customers realign their demand. We continue to be disciplined on operating expenses. We have tightened spending and slowed our pace of hiring, focusing on critical hires for future success. At the same time, we continue to invest in our long-term growth initiatives including our 3-nanometer silicon platform, which is now available for new product designs. In addition, we are committed to executing on a number of new products, which our customers have designed into their mission-critical applications. Over the last few years, we have significantly transformed the company, creating a diversified business with growing exposure to multiple infrastructure end markets with strong secular growth drivers. Our businesses at scale, we have a growing design win funnel, leadership products and strong customer engagement. We've built an extraordinary team at Marvell with a track record of execution excellence, and we believe we are well positioned to navigate the current environment to continue to deliver strong top and bottom line results over the long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Yes. Got you, Blayne. Yes. So on the first one on nearline, as you mentioned, there's been a lot of reports out there about the weakness there. We really hadn't seen that when we guided the quarter. In Q3, we started to see some weakness, but the impact is very pronounced in the fourth quarter, and that nearline weakness obviously flows into the data center end market into that bucket. When you go to China and the weakness we've seen there, that's really in the enterprise area. So while overall enterprise is hanging in there, it was slightly below in Q3. We've had some offsets to that from strength elsewhere. But the main impact of the Chinese customers has really been in enterprise for the most part. Yes. Great question. So let me take it from the top. So first point would be that if you look over the last few years, cloud CapEx has been on fire. It's been growing 30% kind of plus for the last few years. This year, if you look at reports and kind of what we see is probably something in the 15% range for '22 and then it depends on who you talk to, but probably down in the low to mid-single digits or maybe mid-single digits for next year. So that's the deceleration that we're talking about. And as the macro has started to catch up even with these large cloud companies, you see them very publicly tightening their CapEx, tightening their OpEx. And they've had this supply chain built in the data center, which was geared up for a lot of growth. And so as they reset those expectations, it's not a real smooth process. Storage is the most pronounced, as I mentioned earlier. That's the majority reason code for the sequential decline. But we are seeing inventory adjustment as well to a much lesser extent, and I'd say the broader set of product lines outside of storage that we sell into data center. And so that is not a China-specific thing. That is a global comment, including U.S. cloud, seeing inventory adjustment a bit more broadly. And that's a change, certainly from where we were, say, a quarter ago when we were mired in supply escalations and expedites to an environment where it's now how do we work together to manage the inventory and manage the new reality. And so that's what you see in the guide for Q4. Hopefully, that was helpful to give you the perspective you're looking for. Yes. Great question, Vivek. And certainly, I'd frame all this by saying it's still a very dynamic environment. So we'll give you the best view we can. I'd say the first point is we feel very good about the new products that are ramping up and the growth drivers that we've articulated, whether it's cloud optimized silicon, switching, electro-optics, things like that in the data center, 5G, obviously, continued momentum there with additional regions like India ramping next year plus content gain rolling through and then automotive continuing to grow. So those are all the positives. What we don't know completely, but I'll give you the best color I can is on the base business and how much of the inventory correction we're going to be dealing with and the magnitude of that. We anticipate, first of all, that that's like typical cycles. It's probably a couple of quarters to work its way through. And the three areas I would call out that probably are some offsets next year are, one, would be in consumer. That's an area where we just haven't put a lot of investment. We've been typically running that business for cash. You'll probably see some decline there. I think on-premise data center is another area. The on-prem stuff probably has work to do next year. And then maybe a little bit in our wired infrastructure business. If you look, actually, it's kind of interesting, if you go back to our fiscal '22 and you look at those three areas, they all grew pretty dramatically in fiscal '23, the current year we're in. And so at a high level, I think some of those are probably going to trend back to where they were before this big up cycle. And again, from a sort of a timing perspective, think of it as a lot of that headwind or weakness more in the first half, inventory works itself through, and then you have growth back off of that, plus you have the growth drivers kicking in. So I think it's a very different story, most likely first half versus second half. But those are some of the moving pieces in terms of how you think about the growth drivers versus some of the offsets. But we do see -- we still believe we can drive positive year-over-year growth. It just certainly isn't going to be as high as we had been hoping for if you went back even three months ago, just given the magnitude of some of the inventory adjustments. Yes. First, I think you're in the ballpark on storage. And just for a little context, the magnitude of that decline, we can't find a data point that shows it declining that quickly. Even when we look back to the reset in 2019, this is down a lot more than that in the same time frame. So you're right, a lot has come out, and so that needs to normalize. I think you've probably got the math about right if you think about sort of where is the base business at. But just to be clear, we're still in a little bit of a dynamic environment figuring out where this is going to bottom out. But if you look at how fast it's coming down, and that's kind of what we're doing, by the way, we're effectively working with our customers to make sure we deal with this quickly and efficiently and minimize any risk of building excess inventory. And that's the path we're on. So sometime in the Q4, Q1 timeframe, we think that works itself through, and then you start to kind of grow from there. But that's probably reasonable. Probably is an annualized type of run rate, maybe a little bit lower in the first half and certainly higher in the second half as the new designs really ramp up. It's -- there is some. I mean, just to be very, very clear, right? The major reason code for the sequential decline from Q3 to Q4 in the data center line is storage, but there is inventory adjustment going on in digestion given that slope of the CapEx curve has just come down. There is some realignment. But that is not as pronounced, and it's very manageable. But I just -- I want to be very clear, it's not 100% storage issue. There's just a broader digestion. No, I think that was perfect. I mean I just put a pin on it that the wireless opportunity continues to be very exciting, and I think it's going to be a very good year for wireless next year. Sure. I'll make a few comments. And then, Jean, why don't you add as well. Yes, a couple of things are going on. One is the supply environment has definitely improved. Now some of that is because of the weakness in the China market that's opened up supply, we can give to other customers. Because generally, outside of a few select cases, our enterprise business is mostly merchant products. These would be Ethernet switches, gigabit, multi-gigabit PHYs, embedded processors, Karl, things like that. So when you would have a demand softness in 1 region, that helps thing. So the supply situation has improved, which is a good thing. We do have some of our own growth drivers as well. We've highlighted this over the last few quarters. We have some new custom silicon wins that are ramping up. That's offsetting some of that weakness as well. But in general, the non-China piece has done okay. It probably -- we're being cautious about how we think about it for next year. So I think the run rate that we've guided to in Q4 is probably a safe run rate to think about for next year. Even if there's a little bit of weakness or there is some inventory digestion that goes on. We do have content gains still rolling through. And so those are some of the moving pieces. You basically have China going down, U.S. customers where we've got either new design wins or share gain or content gain. And so it sort of all aligns to the numbers where we've guided for Q4. Jean, anything you want to add? Yes. I would say if you -- without getting into the specifics of each of the input costs that we deal with, I would say that in general, with supply loosening up, that's going to be a positive. I'd say that being said, we have -- there are areas that are still constrained. There's still inflationary aspects inside our supply chain that sort of are coming towards us. We're doing what we can to mitigate those. And to the extent we can't mitigate those. We're going to continue to do what we've been doing for the last few years, which is basically pass it on in a generally margin-neutral type of manner. And we found a way to do that, and we'll continue to do that. But certainly, the Marvell team and the operations team has worked aggressively over the last few years, particularly on the packaging back end, et cetera, to enable more sources to set up more strategic agreements. And so we're kind of working on both sides. One is to just do our job as a good supplier and manage the cost base. But to the extent we can't, there will be probably a little bit of inflation still in the system. That's sort of how we're looking at it. We formed really strategic partnerships with these companies. We have a very transparent communication with them on the demand environment. And I'd say that we're counting on them to work with us as partners as we manage through what looks like an overall semiconductor down cycle. Yes. Gary, I would just add, I'd say that if you look at the bundle of the different obligations we have, some of them are in the shorter term, which are in the form of things like prepays and others where as we take the capacity, we actually get it back. The LTA, take-or-pay portion is actually not very large relative to the total. And as Jean said, the most strategic aspect of this is really in the most advanced technologies, especially in complex substrates and high-end packaging, which we absolutely need to secure because of the volume that we're going to be ramping in the next few years. I mean just take the -- as one example, the $800 million of incremental cloud-optimized silicon wins. That all is 5-nanometer technology using advanced ABS substrates, very customized packaging. Those agreements to get that capacity from really the best vendors, you need to put that in place literally years in advance. And so we've done those types of things, and we feel good about that because they're tied directly to committed programs. So as Jean said, overall, while we have obligations, we think they're actually a benefit to us, and it certainly helps us underwrite our future success. And we're able to send a strong message to our customers about how we're able to provide the necessary capacity and supply chain for them -- for their future. Sure. Yes. Let me answer the second one first. The answer is we feel very good about that revenue stream. Part of it is, if you remember, Ross, we went from talking about the $400 million and $800 million to actually talking about, call it, $400-plus million $800-plus million because we had gotten additional design wins that created a little bit of a buffer as well because I think even if we hedge it for next year and the volumes don't quite achieve what we would have thought, we actually had one additional business that gives us some comfort around that. So -- but I would say all the programs are on track. We are fortunate that despite the changing environment, I would say we are absolutely head down in trying to take out multiple new products right now that need to ramp up in very significant volume next year. And I'm personally involved in these with our customers to ensure we're meeting their schedule, and we're doing everything possible to get there. So that's the good news that the programs are still on track. And I think that's a good thing. The percentage -- I think your other question was what was the percentage of data center revenue that's in storage? Yes. Great. Thanks, Harlan, for the question. And you're right, it is a little bit of a different situation than a few years ago where that was fairly nascent technology, really ramping up hard in an inflection curve. That being said, we still see strong adoption of 800 gig. We've seen strong momentum in 400ZR in the new platform. We -- and we expect that overall optics is going to grow next year. That being said, I would say in the fourth quarter, part of the adjustment would be in that area. But I think that's a shorter-term thing. And again, because to your point, it's so strategic, we anticipate that optics is going to continue to grow. And by the way, we're heads down on new product development there as well because for the next generation of high-end 51.2T switches, you're going to need the associated optics with that, which then moves from 800 gigabits per second to 1.6 terabits per second. And so that's an ongoing new product development activity we have. So lots of activity in that area. Super exciting, but it's a little bit of a different environment than 2019 just because there has been more broad adoption, but we do feel good about it. Yes, that's a good question. The -- as we indicated, china is down a lot, right, in Q4 from where it was just two quarters ago. That may end up being a little bit a little bit of an overcorrection. It's hard to tell, quite frankly, on what's going on there and how long that's going to last and how that ripples through. The non-China has been holding up very well. Again, I'd say based on the content gains we have as well as the -- just the new products that are ramping up with higher ASPs. And so that's sort of offsetting it to some extent. What we are guiding for Q4, enterprise networking overall, it's still down just because of the China factor. But I'd say if I had to handicap it for next year, non-China will be a bigger percentage of the total in fiscal '24 than China. But I don't have the exact numbers at the tip of my fingers here. A lot of this goes through the channel and other -- it's -- yes, I just don't have those numbers in front of me. Yes. Thanks, Chris. On the Nokia front, again, it was great to see us being able to announce with them our Layer-2 transport processor. Recall the initial engagement with them, which was very successful, and it's great to see how well they did was on the Layer-1 baseband processor. And that -- I think that partnership has led to now a broader engagement. And so as you probably know, you followed the space, the Layer-2 transport or CPU is a critical component, right, with fairly meaningful content as you sort of roll forward. So I think that's all very positive. And on India, that -- they seem to be gearing up for a very aggressive rollout next year. And I think, to your point, a few of our key customers are well positioned to take advantage of that ramp. And so that's why we said earlier, we feel really good about wireless next year, I think both on sort of our content gains as well as our -- but probably even more the regional deployments. And I think India probably will be sizable would be my guess. Yes. I think the CXL timing, a lot of that is going to be gated tory by the server CPU cycle. And I think companies are gearing up for that. It may have gotten lost in the noise, but we did call out and I called out in my prepared remarks that we had received a pretty significant design win in this area, which we're now well underway in terms of product development. So -- and then I'd say there's a very large pipeline of semi-custom products behind that as well as a merchant product. So I think that activity is still -- level of activity is very high with our customers. But I wouldn't -- I don't have visibility to any sort of change in terms of when those products would ramp necessarily. But it's a very strategic new area for us. And I'd say we continue to be focused on building a leadership position there. A lot of these products, especially as you get into the larger pooling devices, accelerators, these are, in some cases, have multicore CPU. They're in 5-nanometer. They have security features. There's quite a few things that we're adding. And so these are looking more and more like very customized SoCs, which then enable these customers to really take advantage of completely new architectures relative to how they interface their CPU, GPU, XPU whatever you want to call it, ASIC with memory. And so I think that's going to continue to be a very strategic area of focus. And getting a large win committed and underway is a really good thing. I think we need to let that one play out a little bit, Tore. We're taking that one step at a time. I think the milestone really was lining over the last year, really getting our solution designed in across a broad array of high-volume proven cable suppliers to the largest hyperscale companies, and we've done a great job there. And we've now started sampling those, and we have a very high level of interest. But at this juncture, we haven't really sized exactly our opportunity and the timing. But we'll do that in due course as we get better visibility to the take up of our customers that are competing in this market. But that trend is very real. The AEC trend is anyway. And we hope to be an important part of it. Yes. So let me break that into two pieces. I think you absolutely nailed it when you talked about the end customer kind of dynamics and their trajectory versus ours, that is exactly the bullwhip effect. I mean you could actually just draw the bullwhip and you can kind of slap where we would be on that. And that's why -- and we've seen this historically in any business where you're kind of one additional step removed, you tend to have more volatility, right? It's just the way it works. So that, I think, you can expect. And again, we don't know exactly, but we anticipate just on past experience, it's probably a couple of quarters to work through that. And then on the other piece, which was the non-storage piece, yes, it's inventory digestion. I mean we've kind of taken a view, Ambrish, which is -- and I've been through different scenarios in my career here on how you manage when volume -- when demand drops and you can kind of work with people and manage a soft landing or you can keep shipping and then you pay the price later in a very hard way. And so our view has been, let's get through this and get it behind us. And also get to a point where as you can -- as you get your visibility up and inventory goes down and lead times turn to normal, your forecast accuracy improves. I mean I think you know that old that as well. The worst forecast you're going to get is if somebody gives you 52 weeks of orders, you're actually better off having a more normalized environment.  So that's really what we're striving to do there. And so while there is some inventory adjustment, it's fairly normal given the shift in slope in the CapEx trajectory. And we have new products ramping. And so that probably works its way through fairly quickly as well. But we'll have to see the exact timeframe. Like I said, it's still a little bit of a dynamic environment. Ashish, do we have time for one more? Should I just wrap it up with some closing comments? Perfect. Yes. Well, thanks, everybody, for all the questions. Just a little bit of a few comments as we close here. Look, first, I think Q3 was a great quarter for us. I mean we're in the middle of a pretty severe macroeconomic environment. A lot of other companies have obviously seen some of this inventory digestion and impact earlier. But in Q3, we delivered record revenue, very strong operating margins. Even if you look at the fourth quarter guide and you kind of compare our second half of this year to a year ago, we're up about 15%. And when you look at sort of the rest of the market, take sort of large digital peers, that peer group is down about 5%. So we still think even with a softer Q4 guide, we continue to perform very well from a top line perspective. I'd say also we've been disciplined on managing expenses. The pro forma FY '23 will grow about 28%. And if you look at our OpEx increase, it's about 14%. So we've been basically growing operating expenses at about half the rate of revenue growth. And we've been able to put together a world-class team as a result to execute on these massive design wins we've gotten over the last few years. And so while we're going to be disciplined in our spending, and Jean sort of gave you the model on OpEx. We feel very good about the size of the team, the resources we have and the ability to execute, which our customers are counting on. And I believe if we do that, there's even more to come. So in conclusion, we continue to have the right strategy with really strong partnerships with key customers. We think we're in the right markets. And the growth drivers of cloud, 5G wireless communications and automotive continue to be three of the largest growth opportunities in the semiconductor industry, and Marvell is extremely well positioned there. So thanks for all the questions. I'm sure we can be more helpful in the callbacks as well. There's a lot of moving pieces. But thank you so much for your time today."

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the third quarter and then provide our current outlook for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue in the third quarter was $1.537 billion, within our guidance range, growing 1% sequentially and 27% year-over-year, driven by growth from our data infrastructure end market. Data center accounted for 41% of revenue, enterprise networking was 24% of revenue, carrier infrastructure at 18%, consumer at 12% and auto industrial at 5%. GAAP gross margin was 50.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 64% of revenue, below our guidance range primarily due to product mix. Our enterprise and auto industrial end market revenue was lower than expected, and the consumer revenue was higher than our forecast. GAAP operating expenses were $672 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $420 million, declining by 3% sequentially. Year-over-year, OpEx increased by 13%, growing at less than half the rate of the top line revenue growth. OpEx was lower than guidance due to lower bonus accrual and better-than-expected NRE. Our GAAP operating income was $106 million. Non-GAAP operating profit was $564 million or 36.7% of revenue, another all-time record, demonstrating the strong leverage in our operating model. Other income expense, including interest on our debt was $41 million, higher than guidance primarily due to higher interest rate on our outstanding debt. For the third quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $0.02. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.57 within our guidance range. Earnings per share grew 33% year-over-year faster than top line revenue growth. Now turning to our balance sheet and the cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $411 million in cash from operations, reflecting our strong earnings offset by continued working capital investments to support our top line revenue growth, including $94 million in payments for long-term back-end and substrate capacity agreements. These agreements are critical to ramping our complex products in data infrastructure market including the call to optimize the silicon solutions Matt discussed earlier. In the third quarter, we increased our inventory by $44 million or 5% sequentially. Looking at the change in demand we are forecasting in the fourth quarter, we expect our inventory level to continue to be elevated. We are focused on prioritizing new product ramps to support our customers. These -- most of our products have long product cycles of three to five years or even longer. We are comfortable carrying higher inventory in a dynamic supply chain environment and we plan on reducing inventory starting next fiscal year. As of the end of the third fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalent was $723 million increasing by $106 million from the prior quarter. Our total debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.9x and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. During the third quarter, we returned $101 million to shareholders through $51 million in cash dividends and $50 million of share repurchases. In summary, in an uncertain macroeconomic environment, the Marvell team executed very well, delivering top line revenue growth and earnings expansion much faster than revenue growth. Now turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.4 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin in the range of 48.2% to 50.2%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be approximately 64%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $646 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million. As Matt mentioned earlier, we have proactively slowed down our pace of hiring and tightened the discretionary spending to manage our operating expenses. We have a proven track record of executing through economic and the market cycles to maintain strong profitability while we continue to invest in long-term growth initiatives. As a reminder, looking ahead to the first fiscal quarter of 2024, due to the typical seasonality in payroll taxes and employee merit increase, our OpEx tends to increase from the fourth fiscal quarter in the high single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. Following the step-up in the first fiscal quarter, we are currently planning on holding our OpEx approximately flat at that level for the next few quarters. Other income and expense, including interest on our debt is expected to be approximately $44 million. We expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 6% for the fourth quarter and currently expect this to increase slightly to 7% next fiscal year. We expect our basic weighted share outstanding will be 855 million. And our diluted weighted average share outstanding will be 861 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of breakeven to $0.05 per diluted share. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.46, plus or minus $0.05. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. Toshiya, this is Jean. I'll start to answer this question, and then Matt can add. So first, on the carrier infrastructure, wireless is already more than half. We talk about the wireless revenues already running, had more than $600 million annualized run rate. So wireless is definitely small than half. Going into next year, as Matt mentioned earlier, we continue to see strong 5G adoption and our customers continue to do very well in the marketplace. So we do expect the wireless part of the business will continue to have a very strong growth into next year. Of course, the wireline side is what Matt discussed. We are going to see some headwinds on wireline side. But overall, we do expect the carrier infrastructure to continue to grow. Matt, anything you want to add? No. Gary, this is Jean. Thank you for the question. So yes, the purchasing obligation we have this quarter will not change much from the last 10-Q we filed. It's about $3.2 billion. But just remember, those purchase agreement, it's really for long term. On average, it's between four to 10 years. And also, our products are very complex and a lot of them have a very long manufacturing cycle. So we actually need a dedicated capacity for those complex products to support our customers, single cells, the customer, large volume, last long time. Regardless of the economic environment, we need those dedicated capacity. And frankly, our team has been very thoughtful. We only secure the capacity largely in back end and the substrate for portion of what we need. So we feel quite comfortable. We don't have the issues on the purchase agreement obligations or have to write off any capacity. That's not something we anticipate at all. Yes, Ross, maybe I can help you. Yes, I can help you with that. In general, the way to think about this, our storage business, it's probably about 1/3 of the data center -- total data center business; average, right, not a particular quarter. But of course, when we go through the inventory correction, as Matt mentioned earlier, that's going to be the largest drop piece for the inventory correction. Yes. Yes. Maybe let me just recap and clarify. I think before we change the reporting, our storage business annualized run rate is about $1.4 billion. So that's what you are mentioning before we change the reporting by end market. That's what our overall storage business. Just as a reminder, it includes flash controller preamp and also fiber channel. So it's all the different storage product lines included there. And over time, the storage has come down. The number I mentioned, 1/3 is not a particular last quarter. It's more generally, when you look at several quarters, on average, it's 1/3. The first half definitely is much higher and now it's much lower, right? When you think about $1.4 billion storage revenue I'm talking about, about 60% is in data center. That's what we told investors during our Investor Day. So hope that's how you clarify different pieces. I don't think the way you can think about that. It's $1.4 billion. The first half of this year, it probably was much higher than $1.4 billion annualized run rate. And now it's dropping much lower, right? The second half of the run rate probably is very low. Yes."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's second quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO. Let me remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Marvell team drove another record level of revenue at $1.52 billion, growing 41% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Revenue on an annualized run rate exceeded $6 billion, a significant achievement for Marvell. Revenue collectively from our four data infrastructure focused end markets grew 49% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, reaching a new high of 89% of our total revenue. Moving on to the rest of the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin was 51.8%, GAAP operating margin was 2.6% and GAAP EPS was $0.01. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 65%, and our non-GAAP operating margin hit a new record at 36.5% of revenue. Disciplined OpEx management helped drive our non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.57, above the midpoint of guidance. Earnings per share grew 68% year-over-year, much faster than our revenue growth as we continue to drive operating leverage. Now let me provide a brief update on the outlook for demand and supply. We continue to see healthy demand for our products with the exception of consumer HDD, and our overall demand is outpacing supply. The very successful adoption of our new products and strong end market demand has enabled Marvell to grow revenue significantly above our long-term target model. As a reminder, at our last Investor Day in October 2021, we had updated our long-term model for revenue growth to a target range of 15% to 20% from an annualized revenue run rate at that time of $4.3 billion. At the midpoint of the target, it would have taken us two years to achieve $6 billion in annualized revenue run rate. We are very pleased that we were able to cross this milestone this quarter, a full year ahead of our target. As we look forward, we are confident that our long-term growth opportunity is consistent with our target model even off this higher base of revenue. Let me now turn to supply. Despite a choppy supply environment, the strength of our business model and diversity in end markets enabled us to achieve our overall revenue guidance in the second quarter. We expect our revenue mix by end market will continue to be influenced more by supply than demand in the near term. As we continue to secure capacity to support our long-term growth, we are encouraged to see some pockets of additional supply starting to open up on certain nodes and simple package technologies. In contrast, for our high complexity products with long manufacturing cycle times, such as in our data center end market, the supply chain for leading-edge technology and advanced packaging remains very tight. Our operations team continues to execute our strategy to deeply engage with partners to support our long-term growth. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the second quarter was $643 million. On a year-on-year basis, our data center revenue grew 48%, with our cloud business growing significantly faster. The year-over-year growth was very broad-based with multiple product lines contributing to strong results. On a sequential basis, the continued growth from our cloud business was offset by a decline in our on-premise business flattening our data over revenue. In the on-premise business, the sequential decline was driven primarily from our fiber channel and Ethernet adapters. We believe the overall demand picture in cloud data centers remains healthy. and that this market represents the single biggest long-term growth driver for Marvell. We expect growth to continue from a number of exciting areas, including electrooptics, cloud-optimized custom solutions, cloud switching and our broad data center storage portfolio. At the Flash Memory Summit earlier this month, Marvell showcased many state-of-the-art data center storage solutions including our Bravera PCIe Gen 5 SSD controller, an Ethernet Bunch of Flash solution for AI and ML and CXL. As you recall from our discussion last quarter, we see CXL as the next big evolution in cloud data centers that will enable us to increase our reach into the memory ecosystem and presents a multibillion-dollar SAM expansion opportunity for Marvell. This includes a host of new products such as CXL expanders, cooling devices, switches and accelerators and the potential to embed CXL IP and a broad range of our data center products. Events and presentations at FMS strongly validated our excitement around CXL. This is the hottest topic at FMS with standing room-only presentations by many leading industry participants. The Marvell booth, we demonstrated the industry's first CXL memory pooling solution, addressing the challenges related to memory scaling and cloud data centers. While the industry is still in the early stages of CXL adoption, we are working on closing significant opportunities right in front of us at key customers and envision a strong design win pipeline. Turning now to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. In data center, year-over-year, we are expecting revenue growth of over 20%, driven by our cloud end market. Due to the complex nature of products for this end market, we expect supply challenges in the third quarter to impact our ability to fully meet the demand on a sequential basis. As a result, we expect revenue from cloud customers to be flat sequentially and revenue in the on-premise market to decline. Therefore, for our overall data center end market, we project revenue in the third quarter to decline sequentially in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis. However, we expect our data center revenue in the fourth quarter to increase on a sequential basis, anticipating an improvement in supply and new product ramps in cloud. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market, revenue for the second quarter was well-above our forecast at $285 million and growing 45% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. We benefited from a strong performance from both our wireless and wired end markets. Our wireless business continued to advance in the second quarter, benefiting from the growth in 5G adoption. With an annualized revenue run rate crossing $600 million, we are thrilled to have achieved an important milestone. We expect to see an extended period of growth for our 5G business with multiple regions such as Europe and India yet to launch 5G in a meaningful fashion. We expect to see further growth in other large geographies such as the US, which are only in their first year of mainstream deployment. In addition, we have significant content growth in the next generation of base stations still in front of us. In wired, we saw stronger than expected shipments of our coherent DSPs and accompanying TIAs and drivers to wired customers. We are seeing strong demand in metro and long haul carrier markets, driven by a rapid adoption of our 400-gig coherent electro-optics portfolio. We are pleased with the strong launch of these products. Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 for our carrier end market, we were expecting year-on-year revenue growth in the mid-20% range, driven primarily by our wireless end market. On a sequential basis, we expect wireless revenue to continue to grow, driven by 5G deployments. However, after a very strong second quarter, we expect a sequential decline in revenue from wire to more than offset the growth from wireless. As a result, we project revenue from the overall carrier end market to decline in the mid-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market, revenue for the second quarter was $340 million, growing 53% year-over-year and 19% sequentially, better than our guidance driven by improvements in supply. Our strong growth in enterprise networking is primarily a result of our own unique product cycles. Our revenue growth has accelerated as our customers have started shipping their new platforms where we have the dual benefits of share gains and an increase in content, driven by the adoption of higher-value products such as our multi-gigabit PHYs. In the second quarter, we see ongoing growth from our refreshed Ethernet switch and PHY portfolio. We also benefited from a ramp in our custom silicon products for enterprise networking, which is a new growth vector in this end market for Marvell. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect a continuation of strong demand for our products from the enterprise networking end market. As you heard earlier, we are seeing pockets of supply opening up, which should enable us to begin to catch up to demand. As a result, we are projecting revenue from enterprise networking to grow approximately 70% year-over-year and over 20% sequentially. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $84 million, growing 46% year-over-year. Our auto business continued to grow sequentially, but this was more than offset by a supply impacted industrial business. As a result, As a result, overall revenue from the combined end market declined 6% quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year, our auto business, driven by higher adoption of Marvell's Ethernet technology continued its strong growth trajectory with revenue doubling. Last quarter, I discussed our growing list of Ethernet design wins in our auto business, which expanded to eight of the 10 largest OEMs worldwide and 36 OEMs in total. I would highlight that the lifetime revenue from these new design wins is substantially larger than prior wins. At large auto OEMs, we are winning in their highest volume internal combustion engine segments, along with their higher content in their EVs and hybrids. These wins tend to be multi-platform in nature, covering many models simultaneously. Overall, content is continuing to grow, driven by an increase in the number of Ethernet connected end points, coupled with the need for more bandwidth. Looking to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we are projecting revenue growth to remain over 40% year-over-year and grow in the mid-teens sequentially on a percentage basis for the combined auto and industrial end market. We project all of the sequential growth to be driven by our automotive products where we are experiencing strong continuing improvements in supply. Moving on to our consumer end market, revenue for the second quarter was $164 million, declining 1% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Results were below guidance as demand from the HDD market weakened. In contrast to Consumer HDD products, revenue in the second quarter from our consumer SSD controllers continue to grow both sequentially and year-over-year. Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 for our consumer end market, we are forecasting revenue to be flattish sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, we expect revenue from the consumer end market to decline by approximately 10% due to softness in consumer HDD demand, partially offset by continued growth in our SSD business. In closing, we delivered record results for the second quarter and are guiding for continued growth in the third quarter. Our strategy to focus on a diversified portfolio and data infrastructure is playing out very well as we continue to deliver strong results. We have limited exposure to the headwinds that consumer-exposed companies are now facing. In the third quarter, at the midpoint of the range, we are guiding our revenue to grow by 29% year-over-year, and we expect operating leverage in our business model to drive non-GAAP EPS at the midpoint of guidance to grow by 37% year-over-year. Looking forward, we are projecting our revenue growth to accelerate on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter on the back of more supply and new product ramps. As we wrap up the first half of fiscal 2023, I'm very pleased with the trajectory for full year revenue, which is well above the target we established last December. At that time, we had discussed our target for fiscal 2023 annual revenue growth in the low 30% range. I'm very pleased to note that we are running well ahead of that target with full year revenue growth now tracking towards the high 30% range. Over the last six years, through organic investments and strategic M&A, we have significantly transformed the company, pivoting to data infrastructure, accelerating our technology road map and driving a tremendous increase in design wins. We are now seeing the benefits of these efforts and our revenue growth, operating margin expansion and increased exposure to the critical cloud, 5G, and auto end markets. As we look at next fiscal year, despite economic and semiconductor cycle concerns, we are optimistic about our prospects. We expect to benefit from our favorable end market exposure and significant revenue contributions from a number of Marvell-specific product cycles, which we have discussed in detail over the last several quarters. Before I hand off to Jean, let me provide an update on our Board and ESG. Earlier this week, we announced the addition of Rebecca House to the Marvell Board of Directors. She currently serves as Senior Vice President, Chief People and Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary at Rockwell Automation, Global leader in Industrial Automation with 25,000 employees worldwide. She was selected for her extensive background in the areas of talent management, legal, ethics and compliance, public affairs, security and sustainability. I'm excited to have Becky join our already strong group of directors and I am looking forward to working with her. Finally, I'm pleased to announce the publication of Marvell's inaugural sustainability report. I encourage you to review the report on our website to learn more about our ESG performance and future goals. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nJean Hu: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current attribute for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue in the second quarter was $1.517 billion, growing 5% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Data center was our largest end market, accounting for 42% of consolidated revenue. Enterprise networking was next largest with 22% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure and 19%, Consumer added 11% and auto industrial at 6%. GAAP gross margin was 51.8%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $986 million, increasing 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 65% of revenue, slightly below the middle point due to product mix. GAAP operating expenses were $747 million, and included the cost of share-based compensation expenses of $135 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $88 million, an $85 million charge of contractual legal disputes segment and $7 million in other acquisition and divestiture-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $432 million, below the midpoint of our guidance. OpEx increased by 18% year-over-year as we added headcount to deliver the marketable new design we have won with key customers. We continue to drive strong operating leverage to grow OpEx to significantly less than top line revenue growth. GAAP operating income was $39 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit was $554 million, increasing by 67% from a year ago and non-GAAP operating margin was 36.5%, a record for Marvel. For the second quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $0.01. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.57, increasing by 68% year-over-year. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $332 million in cash from operations, reflecting our strong earnings offset by continued working capital investments to support our top line revenue growth. We have increased our inventory by $78 million to better address demand from our customers in a very tight supply chain environment and to help ensure a smooth ramp for a number of new design wins that we expect to start shipping in the next few quarters. The majority of this increase was in raw materials and with -- looking longer term, as the supply chain start to show improvement, we expect our DOI will start to decline. Consistent with our strategy to secure longer-term supply, we have increased our long-term purchase commitment for capacity to support the number of high-volume source of the design wins. Purchase commitments increased by $447 million in the second quarter to a total of approximately $3.4 billion. Please note, this commitment are over a multiyear time period. At the end of the second fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents was $617 million. We intend to maintain a higher cash balance compared to the last few years as our business has significantly increased in scale. Our total debt was $4.6 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was two times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times. We returned $101 million to shareholders through $51 million in cash dividends and $50 million of share repurchase. Now, turning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect the following; revenue will be in the range of $1.56 billion, plus or minus 3%. GAAP to gross margin will be in the range of 51.1%, plus or minus 1.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 65% plus or minus 0.25%. GAAP operating expenses will be in the range of $667 million to $677 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses will be in the range of $435 million to $440 million. At the middle point of our guidance, we expect to deliver 37% non-GAAP operating margin. We continue to make significant progress toward our long-term target of 38% to 40% non-GAAP operating margin. Other income and expense, including interest expense, will be approximately $38 million. For the third quarter, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 6%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 854 million. And our diluted weighted shares outstanding will be 862 million. As a result, we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.05 to $0.13. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.56 to $0.62. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari: Hi good afternoon. thanks so much taking the question. Matt, I wanted to ask a question on calendar 2023 or fiscal 2024. You gave some brief comments as it pertains to some of the big growth drivers that you've talked about in the past. I was hoping you could remind us perhaps the top three drivers that are idiosyncratic to Marvell as you look out into fiscal 2024? And how you're thinking about the supply side of the equation. Do you think by fiscal 2024, you'll be shipping to demand or you'll still be constrained, whether it be wafers or substrates? And the third part of my question, I think consensus has you growing top line by about 17%. Is that a fair number to start off with, or is that too high, too low? Any comments on where Street consensus is today would be helpful. Thanks so much.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Thanks, Toshi. And we'll go ahead and do the trifecta of questions here. No problem. So on the first one, for next year, as you point out, there are a number of Marvell specific growth drivers, which we're very excited about. I'll cover three of them. And then, of course, there's other things going on as well. So the three biggest buckets and then the number one of all three is our cloud optimized silicon ramp. What we've talked about in the last few quarters and even year is a number of new design wins that we achieved over the last couple of years in this cloud optimized silicon area. And we sized it for those of you on the call that haven't been following it at about $400 million of incremental revenue for next year and then $800 million the year after. And that's still tracking extremely well. We have good line of sight on those programs. They're quite diverse in nature, by the way. So there's a number of them that are going to have to ramp and that's all tracking well. The second is, and you saw even in the most current quarter, again, another strong performance out of our 5G business in wireless, and the adoption of 5G will absolutely continue next year. And really, on top of that, which is more specific to Marvell is we have incremental content gains and SAM expansion coming as well. So that's also in front of us. And then on the third, our automotive business, which in general, has been about doubling on a year-on-year basis, if you go back over the last few quarters. This is automotive Ethernet. That also has a very strong outlook as well for next year. And again, this is really based on the breadth of design wins, Toshiya, we have across almost all the major top OEMs as well as virtually all the emerging next-generation car companies. And by the way, it's proliferating both in the ICE vehicles as well as electric vehicles. So those three, I think, are good buckets to think about. On the follow-up on the constraint side, we are seeing some loosening of supply, as I said in my prepared remarks, which we believe will begin to benefit us, some of which will be in Q4. When you -- as you think about next year, when you look at the broader supply chain and you actually focus in on the leading edge technology types of components that are required, whether that's advanced packaging and substrates, some of the advanced node process technology and just some of the complex nature of the products we're dealing with, those we have to manage very carefully. They have long manufacturing cycle times, and we need to plan appropriately. But currently, we feel very good about our line of sight to be able to ramp up these programs in line with what our customers need, and we're having those discussions as we speak. And then the final part is with respect to the outlook next year, I think the biggest thing to take away really is at the highest level, we're ahead of plan on where we thought we were if I went back to our Analyst Day back at the end of 2021, we're on the $6 billion annualized revenue run rate. Now our current year looks like it's going to be above where we thought it would be back at the end of last year. So that's all positive. And as we look forward, we do see the long-term target model being achievable even off this higher revenue run rate. So that's more of a long-term comment. But certainly, if you add up our growth drivers and you look at where we are today, we feel very good about fiscal 2024 or calendar 2023 next year. Thanks.\nToshiya Hari: Thanks so much.\nOperator: The next question comes from C.J. Muse from Evercore. Please, go ahead\nC.J. Muse: Yes, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, a question around data center, particularly as it relates to the October quarter guide. I'm surprised that cloud is tracking only flat. And I guess, is that kind of a supply constraint that caught you by surprise, or otherwise, less than 3% sequential growth seems a little bit light. I would love to hear your thoughts around that.\nMatt Murphy: Yes, no problem, C.J. Yes, a couple of things. One is, I said some of this in the prepared remarks. As we've battled through on the supply side, like a lot of other companies this year, it's been quite lumpy in terms of when the supply comes in and by what end market. And so, on an average quarter, we're not exactly, even over the last few quarters, able to perfectly forecast how much we can deliver. Now that said, in data center just for perspective, we had a huge step up starting in our Q1 of this year. We were constrained last year. We made a lot of great progress. Our Q1, I believe, was up something like 12% sequentially from our Q4 with -- and then we've sort of held at that level, maybe slightly increased a little bit through that time frame. And on the year-over-year basis, cloud has been absolutely on fire. And the final point would be, in the fourth quarter, we see a step up again, both on a sequential basis. So I wouldn't say it necessarily surprised us. I think we've known these programs, and we're doing our best. But at this -- and we're going to try to do better for this quarter, by the way. But at this point, this is how we see it. The cloud business for us has been extremely strong and overall for Marvell, remains healthy. I would say, it's more of a supply timing issue, and our operations team is all over it to try to obviously make sure we meet what our customers need and ramp when they want to ramp.\nC.J. Muse: Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank. Please, go ahead.\nRoss Seymore: Hi. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Matt, I want to talk about the cloud optimized side. I know you answered to a previous question that, that should be an idiosyncratic driver for you next year. But how do I blend together, frankly, the answers to the first and the second question that was already asked, where the cloud side is lumpy, have ups and downs, but the good part is it's idiosyncratic, and you expect it to grow. So I guess the net of it all is, do you see risk to that $400 million over the next year and then another $400 million the year after there it's macro and/or supply stays lumpy, or do you think the customer-specific very customized aspect of those businesses will allow that to grow and deliver those numbers even in a more choppy environment?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Sure, Ross and a great question. Maybe just before I answer it, I'll just give a higher level view. And your question is cloud-specific, but if I just frame the overall Marvell strategy that we've put together and the business model we've put together, it's been one where diversification and breadth of product offering and technology and obviously, the financial model to go with it has been our North Star, right, since I joined the company and since this management team has driven this transformation. So you can even see it in the short term where like, for example, we've got constraints in cloud this quarter, but enterprise and automotive, when you look out to next quarter are doing extremely well, and that\u2019s because of our diversification of our model, all focused around data infrastructure, by the way So while there may be lumpy 'parts' of our business from time to time, that is by design, how we've architected the business model of Marvell. And it's taken a long time to get here. And I think it's actually proving to be very resilient when you look at our Q3 being up and then our Q4 actually accelerating. So that's the bigger picture around how we think about it and managing lumpiness. Now with respect to the cloud, I might want to put a little asterisk by the 400, 800 and that we've actually talked about it being 400-plus and 800-plus in prior calls, which means the 400, 800 was identified last year. And then subsequently, in our communications with investors, including earnings calls, we've said we've actually won more business since then with incremental revenue both in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. So next year and the year after. So think of it as kind of 400-plus, 800-plus diversified across a number of programs. So the bottom line is we feel very good about that ramp. Some of them, I'm sure, will require a lot more than we're planning for at this point. And I'm sure a few of them will require less than we're planning. But in aggregate, when we judge the outlook, and we just did a refresh of this just very recently, not only internally, but even with my key customers in terms of planning for next year, that ramp looks very solid in both of those years.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot, Matt. I also wanted to ask about data center. And last quarter, I think the expectation was that you were going to see some reacceleration as the supply was going to improve into the back half of the fiscal year. So I know that the enterprise portion of that business is weak. But maybe can you help us understand sort of what's going on there? Maybe tell us how much cloud is as a portion of the total data center business? And then also into fiscal Q4, it sounds like total revenue is going to be close to $1.7 billion for you to be up high 30s, and that's up nearly 10% Q-on-Q. But I'm wondering how much data center will be up. I mean you said it's going to be up Q-on-Q, but I would think it should easily be up double-digits with more supply, you have the 5-nanometer products ramping. So I wonder if you can help with that. Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes, a couple of things. So on the first part on the data center, what we've said is that our -- the larger portion of the total is in cloud. So the exact number, we haven't quite disclosed it, but call it closer to 60%, 60-plus percent versus 40%. So that's been -- and that's why we said even in this prior quarter on the year-on-year, cloud grew much faster than the total just because of the enterprise of the mix. Now reminder, a little bit on the enterprise side, it's not a great proxy of what I would call enterprise data center from the standpoint that those products we sell into that market are fiber channel and Ethernet adapters, which are somewhat of a legacy type of business for Marvell. So that one we've been pretty upfront about this. That doesn't have a lot of growth per se ahead. And so really, it's been all about the cloud. The -- in Q4, as we said, the overall company revenue, we expect to accelerate off of Q3. We haven't pegged the number. I think the range you're discussing looks a little on the high side. But if you just back in to the high 30s comment we made and you take the two quarters we've already produced, we take our Q3 guide and look at Q4, you'll get to a range that seems to make sense. So yeah, I guess bottom line is we do -- and I think the acceleration we thought we would get in the second half on cloud is more a Q4 type of story than Q3, and that's how it's playing out primarily on the basis of supply.\nTimothy Arcuri: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to go back to the demand part of the equation. I thought you said in the beginning, consumer HDDs were the only thing weak, but you have two segments that are down. So just maybe just revisit that even in the areas like enterprise that are up a bit, it sounds like supply. So I just wanted if you could revisit the demand outlook and I think you said data center is lumpy, but I mean is it all lumping in timing and supply even for the businesses that are down, or have you seen any broader downticks on that demand side?\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Blayne, I think when I look at your question there, the enterprise side and particularly the on-prem, I do think that, that has been more lumpy in terms of the supply we've gotten and how we've delivered it. We haven't really seen a lot of demand changes there per se. But we certainly, in our first quarter and a little bit of our second quarter, we're able to produce more supply than we had hoped. So when we talk to customers, the demand signals there don't look anything out of the ordinary versus what we have seen historically. This because it kind of feels like we're going back to a little bit of where we were before this huge up cycle. But it's all within the normal range. I think the comment on consumer HDD was really -- it's down, it's pronounced. We can quantify it. But the other part you mentioned is it's more around the lumpiness of our supply delivery rather than demand being down.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Ramsay: Yeah. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I don't know, just for a change of pace, maybe something not engage.\nMatt Murphy: You can go there, Matt, no problem.\nMatt Ramsay: I wanted to ask about the enterprise networking segment. The big upside there and guiding for almost 25% growth or 70% year-over-year. Is that -- maybe you could talk about the specific product cycles that are going on there, or is it, in fact, that's where you're able to upside in supply and just disaggregate what's driving that to be the fastest-growing segment right now? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Actually, it's a combination of both where we have very strong demand for our products. I'll cover that in a second on why that's a little bit unique to us. But then also, I would say, we're -- we have been -- we called this out a couple of quarters ago. This had been one of our more pronounced areas of delinquency, and we're starting to finally catch up. So it's a combination of both, Matt, which I think is producing a very strong result, obviously, as we guide out not only in the Q3 guide, but also the quarter we just finished. So, on the demand side, I mean, we've -- I think a couple of things, right? In our sort of classic Marvell portfolio we've had very consistent share gains and new product introductions with a lot of success in the enterprise class Ethernet switch and PHY area. In some of those cases, we sell the two products together as part of a total solution. And one trend that I think we had talked about for quite a while, and it's actually here, and it's right in front of us, and it's showing up in our numbers is the adoption of multi-gig PHY technology. The large enterprise OEMs, and you can listen to their commentary, they're seeing a big uptick. A lot of that is driven by WiFi 6, which at some point, the wireless rate line rate was going faster than the wired rate. So, that's driven a pretty big adoption. And the content and the per port has gone up dramatically as you switch to multi-gig. And it's not like 10%, 20%, 30%. It's sort of multiples on a per port basis of where it was before. And that's hitting, okay? So, you've got increased PHY content, new products ramping. We've won new customers over the last few years and we've gained share. So, that's been a good story, and it's been pretty consistent, by the way, although it's accelerated in the last few quarters. And then on top of that, a lot of the constraints we had in this area, we finally started seeing the supply improvements based on our own partnerships that we've struck with our various suppliers. And so that's starting to benefit as well. And we're finally sort of getting more caught up here. So, all-in-all, I think a great performance, obviously, out of enterprise. It's at a much higher run rate than I think certainly, people were planning or we were even thinking back at our Investor Day a year ago, but we're pleased that I think the designs we won actually have ramped up, and we still have a bright outlook from here. The final one I would say, Matt, is that we also had some new incremental business on custom-silicon and ASIC in the enterprise, which was not an area where we historically played. And those are also going to production as well, both starting this year, but even reaching full volume or not -- let's call it, run rate volume next year. So, I think a lot of new product stuff and good supply improvements.\nMatt Ramsay: Thanks for all the detail Matt.\nOperator: The next question is from Gary Mobley from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nGary Mobley: Good afternoon everybody. Thanks for taking my question. I had a couple of questions on the -- some of your foundry relationships. Jean, I believe you mentioned that you're purchase obligations with your foundry partners ticked up about 15% sequentially. It sits in about a half years' worth of revenue. I'm wondering if given that capacity seems to be freeing up a bit, might we see that those purchase obligations level off? And what are the risks there of maybe not being able to take all that commitment in the future? And then as well, have you -- or do you anticipate any additional price increases from your foundry partners that you may eventually have to pass on to customers?\nJean Hu: Yes. Hey Gary, thanks for the question. First, on the long-term purchase commitment. As Matt mentioned, right, we focus on data infrastructure. Our products tend to have a very long product cycle and most of our products were so soft. So, based on the design wins we have and the product ramp and the business planning, we struck strategic relationships with our suppliers to ensure we can secure the capacity in the longer term. So when you look at the purchase commitment, those are very long-term commitments like two, three, five to seven or even beyond the years. Our team has done a great job to really analyze what we need and what we should strike as a long-term purchase agreement. Typically, it's only a very small portion of our overall supply needs. So we actually feel very comfortable by analyzing the need, the product ramp or the customer relationship and what we are committing. If you look at it each year, it's actually very small month, right, its spread into seven years and beyond. So we feel pretty good about that. On your second question about supply chain input cost, it's still very tight supply chain environment. We continue to believe in next year we are going to continue to face challenges in complex substrate and some of the component and even older generation wafer side. So, for us, we definitely -- if there's input cost increase because of supply-demand imbalance, our strategy and our approach has been really working with our suppliers and the customers to make sure we share the cost to increase overall. So that's our current expectation.\nGary Mobley: Thanks, Jean.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please, go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. On the cloud optical connectivity business, this is both inside and between data centers, the upgrade cycles have been this really great multi-year tailwind for the team. And if I look into next year, I believe that there's still at least one of the top four US hyperscale titans that's going to start the 400-gig PAM4 transition. You still have China CSPs that need to fire. You've got multiple customers on DR that's going to fire as well. Historically, like these transitions, I don't think have been impacted by a slowing macro demand environment. They're viewed as, I think, very strategic. But is that how your cloud customers are thinking about these upgrades and your views on continued upgrade momentum in this segment for next year? And just relatedly, is the Innovium team on track to drive $150 million in revenues this year?\nMatt Murphy: Hey. Thanks, Harlan. Yes, I think the first part of it, you got pretty well in terms of the transition on 200 and 400 gig PAM4 inside the data center. And then, the new ramps we're seeing in 400 gig ZR for DCI between data centers. What I'd add on top of that is -- which has been extremely strong and also, in some ways, a little bit of a constraint we've seen in terms of being able to keep up is, the demand on 800 gig, which is happening right now really around, obviously, very advanced AI workloads. That is an area where, if we could obviously produce more material, we would be shipping it in Q3. So that's also a positive trend. So you've got sort of the transition going on all the way up to 800 gig, and that continues to look pretty good. On the data center switching side, we are on track for the $150 million of data center switching this year. And we see very good traction in the market to -- in the solutions, we're talking about now at 51.2 with our PAM4 DSPs as kind of a total solution. So that's also going well. The team has been integrated very well into the company. Road map looks very strong. It's pretty exciting. So that was another growth vector that I did not mention upfront, but I guess you could lump -- it's not part of our 400, 800 cloud, the $1 million ramp. But that's also incremental opportunity for us in cloud switching.\nHarlan Sur: Perfect. Thanks, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTore Svanberg: Yes. Congrats on another record quarter. Just kind of staying a little bit on what's to come, especially in the next few years. You talked quite a bit about CXL. I was just wondering when will that business start to ramp? I mean we're talking about more than $1 billion SAM here? And when could that business sort of become bigger than the Consumer HDD business. Just to kind of put into perspective, unique growth drivers versus market drivers? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Well, Tore, that would be a great day. We can crack the champagne if we can get CXL, up to where the consumer or the HDD business used to be. But in all seriousness, this is new. This is a new technology transition that's happening. It's actually very exciting for the team to look at now really enabling these solutions to -- in the memory ecosystem. The -- we have a full road map that's well underway in terms of product development but it's still early. So we're still a couple of years out. And by the way, just to be clear on the opportunity, that's the SAM, we said was over time. The $1 billion-plus or multibillion. So it's still a ways out. We're not ready to sort of talk about when the timing exactly of that, but we're very encouraged. It's an absolute real trend. We intend to be a leader here. We're investing ahead of the curve. Tremendous traction on our road map and the breadth of what we can do in CXL. So it's an exciting one, and we just thought it was appropriate to flag that for investors is yet another opportunity to leverage a lot of the great technology we have into the same set of accounts. And in the case of CXL actually helped enable them, right, to architect these solutions for the future. So I think it's going to be a pretty exciting one, but it's a little ways out. And none of that is sort of in the -- like the $400 million next year, as an example. That's not part of it. That would all be incremental a few years out.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Srini Pajjuri from SMBC Nikko. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Hi, Matt. My question is on 5G, in particular. Now that India 5G auctions are behind us, I'm just curious as to how we should think about that opportunity, Matt? I think you have a pretty strong position there, but could you put that into perspective versus a US opportunity or Europe opportunity? And then the second half strength, is that what's driving it? I think you're guiding 5G to be up even in the third quarter. So I'm just curious if you're seeing any action from India as yet? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. And Jean, you can chime in, but I think India for us is still -- I think that's still a next year type of event, although the -- as you mentioned, the tenders have gone through. We're well positioned for that. I think we've historically through our partners, had a strong position there. But I would say it's -- the way to think about our 5G business now is more broader, diversified and a consistent performer. So I don't think you're going to see it take some enormous leap in a given quarter as an example. I mean, it's been performing extremely well. If you go all the way back to kind of the initial ramps two-plus years ago, we basically had sequential growth, I think about every quarter, except one, maybe, I don't know, seven quarters ago where we were flat or something, right? So it's -- I think, again, it's a good example maybe at a smaller scale of the diversification strategy we've tried to drive, whereas, we go into these markets, we do try to find a number of key partners to line up with such that we're -- we try to reduce volatility and perform well in any environment. So I think India is just another example. But I think there's also other geographies that are going to be laying in as well. And I think maybe even the bigger tailwind is just increased content as new systems roll out with more and more Marvell silicon per base station. I think that's really where will be a bigger impact than a particular geography ramping up in a given quarter. But Jean, any thoughts on that to add?\nJean Hu: Yeah. Matt, to just add to what you just said is this year, we have seen significant growth, and the run rate is already over $600 million now. And that's actually largely benefited by North America, right? And the North American adoption of 5G has been really strong this year. Going forward, India definitely maybe next year or beyond. But Matt is right, is our 5G business will continue to be a very significant growth driver next year for us. It has a really long product cycle and the visibility actually is pretty good in this market.\nSrini Pajjuri: Got it. Thanks Jean. Thanks Matt.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nHarsh Kumar: Yeah. Hey, Matt, I had a question for you. So if I layer in your thoughts on the $400 million odd of custom cloud silicon, that's about 15% growth by itself to your cloud business. And then I assume your business will grow at least that much, if not more, organically. So is it fair for us to think for January 2024 for that data center business to be somewhere in the 30-something odd percent range or even better than that? Yeah.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah, I think I'd have to probably get out a spreadsheet to go figure that one out, Harsh. But I think directionally, I think you're right in that. You have an estimate of what our cloud revenues are and certainly layering in the $400 million would get you to a certain number. And then you're absolutely right, what I didn't bring up is that the base business, right, which doesn't include the new wins is also ramping up. So we haven't sized that piece of it exactly, but clearly, that's going to grow as well next year, the kind of existing run rate portfolio because some of those programs whether it's in cloud switching, whether it's in electro optics, some of the things we've already talked about today that are already in the run rate are certainly going to grow. So yeah, I think that's -- I think from there, you'll have to kind of -- I think when you say 2024, I got a -- I don't know that exact number off the top of my head so.\nHarsh Kumar: No, very helpful. Thank you Matt. Appreciate it.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham. Please go ahead.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey Matt, I wanted to follow-up on Matt Ramsay's question on enterprise networking. If I look at the business in the October quarter, it looks like you'll be over $400 million, and that's up probably two and a half times over two years. So, phenomenal growth, but clearly well ahead of the market. I know -- some of that is content gains, some of its market share. But if you look at inventory in the networking space, OEM inventory levels are probably up 2x over that two-year period. And so -- do you guys have any way of knowing whether there's any inventory that's accumulated in that channel? Do you think you can sort of sustain this $400 million quarterly run rate into next year, or do you think you may see some ebb and flows especially after a very strong October levels looking beyond October?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Okay, Quinn, it's a great question. And certainly, we're very aware of kind of the broader inventory growth that's gone on in a number of the end markets that we serve. And this one, in particular, I think a couple of things give us a lot of comfort. The first is we've still been ramping into some of these new designs. So, they're not -- it's not business we had two years ago and it was at x run rate, and now it's at x times two run rate. I mean almost all of this is effectively new programs that have ramped up. I guess the silver lining is on the supply constraint so far is that we haven't been able to get over our skis on over shipping. And so -- and we continue to have escalations by the way, even within enterprise networking today, in terms of trying to meet the demand. And again, as I said, because we're in the new systems and the new programs, those are the ones typically our OEMs are the most short on, and they're trying to sell. So, I think it's a very fair question. And certainly, for somebody that's got a lot of market share in a given end market that had a run rate business, that had been going on for a while and it got inflated because of inventory growth over the last few years, one would get concerned. But that's not as much of a concern for us overall in enterprise networking today. And so I think we feel pretty good about the run rate we're on and the fact that we're running a lot farther ahead than we thought, and we still have some growth ahead of us, but we're watching it closely for sure, Quinn. No question.\nQuinn Bolton: Great. And just as a quick follow-up, can you comment about how much of your cloud business or hyperscale business maybe driven by the Chinese hyperscalers? I know some of the -- your peers in the industry have commented that they've seen a recent weakening demand out of the China hyperscalers? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. We're -- go ahead Jean.\nJean Hu: Hi Quinn, this is Jean. I'll answer, Matt, can add. Our cloud business are primarily US hyperscale data centers. So, we actually have a very limited revenue exposure with the Chinese hyperscale data centers today.\nQuinn Bolton: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Moore from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nJoe Moore: Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the supply constraints. I think a quarter or so ago, probably our biggest problem was analog parts, I know substrates have also been an issue trailing-edge wafers. Are those priorities shifting? You talked about a little bit at the sort of more complicated parts that are giving you trouble. Can you just talk a little bit about where is supply getting better? What supply chain is getting better and what's getting worse? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Great. Thanks, Joe. No, I think you're right. I think certainly -- I mean, there's independent of us, right, there's been broader constraints within the analog peer group that have caused sort of golden screw issues and things like that with -- and remains to be seen when all those sort themselves out. For our purposes, and again, some of those constraints overlap, because we do -- in some of our mixed signal technology, we do have a pretty broad usage of some of the older nodes relative to CMOS or by CMOS technology, which would be 28-nanometer, 40-nanometer, 55/65. Those have been historically over the last two years, very constrained. They continue to be constrained. We've -- but it's gotten better for sure. It's gotten better. And some of that -- some of those older nodes have been where the lumpiness of our supply has come in. You can see actually even when you look at our guide for the automotive business, those -- the five portion of that business uses some of this older technology. And you can see we're very strong sequential guide there. So that is starting to work itself out. There's still constraints where we're having a little bit more trouble. And I think some of the peers are too, is just when you get into these larger, more complex packages, Joe, that use flip-chip BGAs and large complex substrates, that's still in very rough shape. And you have to plan way in advance, even now, for the capacity that's going to be required there. That trend on ABF especially is only going to go up. And so, I think, the more complex products is where it continues to be a pain point. And I do think over time, as the cycle plays itself out, probably some of the legacy nodes and the analog stuff probably lightens up. But I think for high complexity, there's just such a move in the industry, companies like Marvell and a lot of our large peers who more and more are just producing tremendous amounts of compute power and high-performance computing broadly, whether it's in networking or custom-silicon or CPUs or GPUs, you name it, it's all going to this complex technology, and that's where we have to just continue to be tactical and keep our heads down and match supply and demand and get what we need.\nJoe Moore: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session as well as our conference. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Matt Murphy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, the Marvell team drove another record level of revenue at $1.52 billion, growing 41% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Revenue on an annualized run rate exceeded $6 billion, a significant achievement for Marvell. Revenue collectively from our four data infrastructure focused end markets grew 49% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, reaching a new high of 89% of our total revenue. Moving on to the rest of the income statement. Our GAAP gross margin was 51.8%, GAAP operating margin was 2.6% and GAAP EPS was $0.01. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 65%, and our non-GAAP operating margin hit a new record at 36.5% of revenue. Disciplined OpEx management helped drive our non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.57, above the midpoint of guidance. Earnings per share grew 68% year-over-year, much faster than our revenue growth as we continue to drive operating leverage. Now let me provide a brief update on the outlook for demand and supply. We continue to see healthy demand for our products with the exception of consumer HDD, and our overall demand is outpacing supply. The very successful adoption of our new products and strong end market demand has enabled Marvell to grow revenue significantly above our long-term target model. As a reminder, at our last Investor Day in October 2021, we had updated our long-term model for revenue growth to a target range of 15% to 20% from an annualized revenue run rate at that time of $4.3 billion. At the midpoint of the target, it would have taken us two years to achieve $6 billion in annualized revenue run rate. We are very pleased that we were able to cross this milestone this quarter, a full year ahead of our target. As we look forward, we are confident that our long-term growth opportunity is consistent with our target model even off this higher base of revenue. Let me now turn to supply. Despite a choppy supply environment, the strength of our business model and diversity in end markets enabled us to achieve our overall revenue guidance in the second quarter. We expect our revenue mix by end market will continue to be influenced more by supply than demand in the near term. As we continue to secure capacity to support our long-term growth, we are encouraged to see some pockets of additional supply starting to open up on certain nodes and simple package technologies. In contrast, for our high complexity products with long manufacturing cycle times, such as in our data center end market, the supply chain for leading-edge technology and advanced packaging remains very tight. Our operations team continues to execute our strategy to deeply engage with partners to support our long-term growth. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the second quarter was $643 million. On a year-on-year basis, our data center revenue grew 48%, with our cloud business growing significantly faster. The year-over-year growth was very broad-based with multiple product lines contributing to strong results. On a sequential basis, the continued growth from our cloud business was offset by a decline in our on-premise business flattening our data over revenue. In the on-premise business, the sequential decline was driven primarily from our fiber channel and Ethernet adapters. We believe the overall demand picture in cloud data centers remains healthy. and that this market represents the single biggest long-term growth driver for Marvell. We expect growth to continue from a number of exciting areas, including electrooptics, cloud-optimized custom solutions, cloud switching and our broad data center storage portfolio. At the Flash Memory Summit earlier this month, Marvell showcased many state-of-the-art data center storage solutions including our Bravera PCIe Gen 5 SSD controller, an Ethernet Bunch of Flash solution for AI and ML and CXL. As you recall from our discussion last quarter, we see CXL as the next big evolution in cloud data centers that will enable us to increase our reach into the memory ecosystem and presents a multibillion-dollar SAM expansion opportunity for Marvell. This includes a host of new products such as CXL expanders, cooling devices, switches and accelerators and the potential to embed CXL IP and a broad range of our data center products. Events and presentations at FMS strongly validated our excitement around CXL. This is the hottest topic at FMS with standing room-only presentations by many leading industry participants. The Marvell booth, we demonstrated the industry's first CXL memory pooling solution, addressing the challenges related to memory scaling and cloud data centers. While the industry is still in the early stages of CXL adoption, we are working on closing significant opportunities right in front of us at key customers and envision a strong design win pipeline. Turning now to the third quarter of fiscal 2023. In data center, year-over-year, we are expecting revenue growth of over 20%, driven by our cloud end market. Due to the complex nature of products for this end market, we expect supply challenges in the third quarter to impact our ability to fully meet the demand on a sequential basis. As a result, we expect revenue from cloud customers to be flat sequentially and revenue in the on-premise market to decline. Therefore, for our overall data center end market, we project revenue in the third quarter to decline sequentially in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis. However, we expect our data center revenue in the fourth quarter to increase on a sequential basis, anticipating an improvement in supply and new product ramps in cloud. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market, revenue for the second quarter was well-above our forecast at $285 million and growing 45% year-over-year and 13% sequentially. We benefited from a strong performance from both our wireless and wired end markets. Our wireless business continued to advance in the second quarter, benefiting from the growth in 5G adoption. With an annualized revenue run rate crossing $600 million, we are thrilled to have achieved an important milestone. We expect to see an extended period of growth for our 5G business with multiple regions such as Europe and India yet to launch 5G in a meaningful fashion. We expect to see further growth in other large geographies such as the US, which are only in their first year of mainstream deployment. In addition, we have significant content growth in the next generation of base stations still in front of us. In wired, we saw stronger than expected shipments of our coherent DSPs and accompanying TIAs and drivers to wired customers. We are seeing strong demand in metro and long haul carrier markets, driven by a rapid adoption of our 400-gig coherent electro-optics portfolio. We are pleased with the strong launch of these products. Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 for our carrier end market, we were expecting year-on-year revenue growth in the mid-20% range, driven primarily by our wireless end market. On a sequential basis, we expect wireless revenue to continue to grow, driven by 5G deployments. However, after a very strong second quarter, we expect a sequential decline in revenue from wire to more than offset the growth from wireless. As a result, we project revenue from the overall carrier end market to decline in the mid-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market, revenue for the second quarter was $340 million, growing 53% year-over-year and 19% sequentially, better than our guidance driven by improvements in supply. Our strong growth in enterprise networking is primarily a result of our own unique product cycles. Our revenue growth has accelerated as our customers have started shipping their new platforms where we have the dual benefits of share gains and an increase in content, driven by the adoption of higher-value products such as our multi-gigabit PHYs. In the second quarter, we see ongoing growth from our refreshed Ethernet switch and PHY portfolio. We also benefited from a ramp in our custom silicon products for enterprise networking, which is a new growth vector in this end market for Marvell. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect a continuation of strong demand for our products from the enterprise networking end market. As you heard earlier, we are seeing pockets of supply opening up, which should enable us to begin to catch up to demand. As a result, we are projecting revenue from enterprise networking to grow approximately 70% year-over-year and over 20% sequentially. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $84 million, growing 46% year-over-year. Our auto business continued to grow sequentially, but this was more than offset by a supply impacted industrial business. As a result, As a result, overall revenue from the combined end market declined 6% quarter-over-quarter. Year-over-year, our auto business, driven by higher adoption of Marvell's Ethernet technology continued its strong growth trajectory with revenue doubling. Last quarter, I discussed our growing list of Ethernet design wins in our auto business, which expanded to eight of the 10 largest OEMs worldwide and 36 OEMs in total. I would highlight that the lifetime revenue from these new design wins is substantially larger than prior wins. At large auto OEMs, we are winning in their highest volume internal combustion engine segments, along with their higher content in their EVs and hybrids. These wins tend to be multi-platform in nature, covering many models simultaneously. Overall, content is continuing to grow, driven by an increase in the number of Ethernet connected end points, coupled with the need for more bandwidth. Looking to the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we are projecting revenue growth to remain over 40% year-over-year and grow in the mid-teens sequentially on a percentage basis for the combined auto and industrial end market. We project all of the sequential growth to be driven by our automotive products where we are experiencing strong continuing improvements in supply. Moving on to our consumer end market, revenue for the second quarter was $164 million, declining 1% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Results were below guidance as demand from the HDD market weakened. In contrast to Consumer HDD products, revenue in the second quarter from our consumer SSD controllers continue to grow both sequentially and year-over-year. Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2023 for our consumer end market, we are forecasting revenue to be flattish sequentially. On a year-over-year basis, we expect revenue from the consumer end market to decline by approximately 10% due to softness in consumer HDD demand, partially offset by continued growth in our SSD business. In closing, we delivered record results for the second quarter and are guiding for continued growth in the third quarter. Our strategy to focus on a diversified portfolio and data infrastructure is playing out very well as we continue to deliver strong results. We have limited exposure to the headwinds that consumer-exposed companies are now facing. In the third quarter, at the midpoint of the range, we are guiding our revenue to grow by 29% year-over-year, and we expect operating leverage in our business model to drive non-GAAP EPS at the midpoint of guidance to grow by 37% year-over-year. Looking forward, we are projecting our revenue growth to accelerate on a sequential basis in the fourth quarter on the back of more supply and new product ramps. As we wrap up the first half of fiscal 2023, I'm very pleased with the trajectory for full year revenue, which is well above the target we established last December. At that time, we had discussed our target for fiscal 2023 annual revenue growth in the low 30% range. I'm very pleased to note that we are running well ahead of that target with full year revenue growth now tracking towards the high 30% range. Over the last six years, through organic investments and strategic M&A, we have significantly transformed the company, pivoting to data infrastructure, accelerating our technology road map and driving a tremendous increase in design wins. We are now seeing the benefits of these efforts and our revenue growth, operating margin expansion and increased exposure to the critical cloud, 5G, and auto end markets. As we look at next fiscal year, despite economic and semiconductor cycle concerns, we are optimistic about our prospects. We expect to benefit from our favorable end market exposure and significant revenue contributions from a number of Marvell-specific product cycles, which we have discussed in detail over the last several quarters. Before I hand off to Jean, let me provide an update on our Board and ESG. Earlier this week, we announced the addition of Rebecca House to the Marvell Board of Directors. She currently serves as Senior Vice President, Chief People and Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary at Rockwell Automation, Global leader in Industrial Automation with 25,000 employees worldwide. She was selected for her extensive background in the areas of talent management, legal, ethics and compliance, public affairs, security and sustainability. I'm excited to have Becky join our already strong group of directors and I am looking forward to working with her. Finally, I'm pleased to announce the publication of Marvell's inaugural sustainability report. I encourage you to review the report on our website to learn more about our ESG performance and future goals. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Yeah. Thanks, Toshi. And we'll go ahead and do the trifecta of questions here. No problem. So on the first one, for next year, as you point out, there are a number of Marvell specific growth drivers, which we're very excited about. I'll cover three of them. And then, of course, there's other things going on as well. So the three biggest buckets and then the number one of all three is our cloud optimized silicon ramp. What we've talked about in the last few quarters and even year is a number of new design wins that we achieved over the last couple of years in this cloud optimized silicon area. And we sized it for those of you on the call that haven't been following it at about $400 million of incremental revenue for next year and then $800 million the year after. And that's still tracking extremely well. We have good line of sight on those programs. They're quite diverse in nature, by the way. So there's a number of them that are going to have to ramp and that's all tracking well. The second is, and you saw even in the most current quarter, again, another strong performance out of our 5G business in wireless, and the adoption of 5G will absolutely continue next year. And really, on top of that, which is more specific to Marvell is we have incremental content gains and SAM expansion coming as well. So that's also in front of us. And then on the third, our automotive business, which in general, has been about doubling on a year-on-year basis, if you go back over the last few quarters. This is automotive Ethernet. That also has a very strong outlook as well for next year. And again, this is really based on the breadth of design wins, Toshiya, we have across almost all the major top OEMs as well as virtually all the emerging next-generation car companies. And by the way, it's proliferating both in the ICE vehicles as well as electric vehicles. So those three, I think, are good buckets to think about. On the follow-up on the constraint side, we are seeing some loosening of supply, as I said in my prepared remarks, which we believe will begin to benefit us, some of which will be in Q4. When you -- as you think about next year, when you look at the broader supply chain and you actually focus in on the leading edge technology types of components that are required, whether that's advanced packaging and substrates, some of the advanced node process technology and just some of the complex nature of the products we're dealing with, those we have to manage very carefully. They have long manufacturing cycle times, and we need to plan appropriately. But currently, we feel very good about our line of sight to be able to ramp up these programs in line with what our customers need, and we're having those discussions as we speak. And then the final part is with respect to the outlook next year, I think the biggest thing to take away really is at the highest level, we're ahead of plan on where we thought we were if I went back to our Analyst Day back at the end of 2021, we're on the $6 billion annualized revenue run rate. Now our current year looks like it's going to be above where we thought it would be back at the end of last year. So that's all positive. And as we look forward, we do see the long-term target model being achievable even off this higher revenue run rate. So that's more of a long-term comment. But certainly, if you add up our growth drivers and you look at where we are today, we feel very good about fiscal 2024 or calendar 2023 next year. Thanks. Yes, no problem, C.J. Yes, a couple of things. One is, I said some of this in the prepared remarks. As we've battled through on the supply side, like a lot of other companies this year, it's been quite lumpy in terms of when the supply comes in and by what end market. And so, on an average quarter, we're not exactly, even over the last few quarters, able to perfectly forecast how much we can deliver. Now that said, in data center just for perspective, we had a huge step up starting in our Q1 of this year. We were constrained last year. We made a lot of great progress. Our Q1, I believe, was up something like 12% sequentially from our Q4 with -- and then we've sort of held at that level, maybe slightly increased a little bit through that time frame. And on the year-over-year basis, cloud has been absolutely on fire. And the final point would be, in the fourth quarter, we see a step up again, both on a sequential basis. So I wouldn't say it necessarily surprised us. I think we've known these programs, and we're doing our best. But at this -- and we're going to try to do better for this quarter, by the way. But at this point, this is how we see it. The cloud business for us has been extremely strong and overall for Marvell, remains healthy. I would say, it's more of a supply timing issue, and our operations team is all over it to try to obviously make sure we meet what our customers need and ramp when they want to ramp. Yes. Yes. Sure, Ross and a great question. Maybe just before I answer it, I'll just give a higher level view. And your question is cloud-specific, but if I just frame the overall Marvell strategy that we've put together and the business model we've put together, it's been one where diversification and breadth of product offering and technology and obviously, the financial model to go with it has been our North Star, right, since I joined the company and since this management team has driven this transformation. So you can even see it in the short term where like, for example, we've got constraints in cloud this quarter, but enterprise and automotive, when you look out to next quarter are doing extremely well, and that's because of our diversification of our model, all focused around data infrastructure, by the way So while there may be lumpy 'parts' of our business from time to time, that is by design, how we've architected the business model of Marvell. And it's taken a long time to get here. And I think it's actually proving to be very resilient when you look at our Q3 being up and then our Q4 actually accelerating. So that's the bigger picture around how we think about it and managing lumpiness. Now with respect to the cloud, I might want to put a little asterisk by the 400, 800 and that we've actually talked about it being 400-plus and 800-plus in prior calls, which means the 400, 800 was identified last year. And then subsequently, in our communications with investors, including earnings calls, we've said we've actually won more business since then with incremental revenue both in fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025. So next year and the year after. So think of it as kind of 400-plus, 800-plus diversified across a number of programs. So the bottom line is we feel very good about that ramp. Some of them, I'm sure, will require a lot more than we're planning for at this point. And I'm sure a few of them will require less than we're planning. But in aggregate, when we judge the outlook, and we just did a refresh of this just very recently, not only internally, but even with my key customers in terms of planning for next year, that ramp looks very solid in both of those years. Sure. Yes, a couple of things. So on the first part on the data center, what we've said is that our -- the larger portion of the total is in cloud. So the exact number, we haven't quite disclosed it, but call it closer to 60%, 60-plus percent versus 40%. So that's been -- and that's why we said even in this prior quarter on the year-on-year, cloud grew much faster than the total just because of the enterprise of the mix. Now reminder, a little bit on the enterprise side, it's not a great proxy of what I would call enterprise data center from the standpoint that those products we sell into that market are fiber channel and Ethernet adapters, which are somewhat of a legacy type of business for Marvell. So that one we've been pretty upfront about this. That doesn't have a lot of growth per se ahead. And so really, it's been all about the cloud. The -- in Q4, as we said, the overall company revenue, we expect to accelerate off of Q3. We haven't pegged the number. I think the range you're discussing looks a little on the high side. But if you just back in to the high 30s comment we made and you take the two quarters we've already produced, we take our Q3 guide and look at Q4, you'll get to a range that seems to make sense. So yeah, I guess bottom line is we do -- and I think the acceleration we thought we would get in the second half on cloud is more a Q4 type of story than Q3, and that's how it's playing out primarily on the basis of supply. Yeah. Blayne, I think when I look at your question there, the enterprise side and particularly the on-prem, I do think that, that has been more lumpy in terms of the supply we've gotten and how we've delivered it. We haven't really seen a lot of demand changes there per se. But we certainly, in our first quarter and a little bit of our second quarter, we're able to produce more supply than we had hoped. So when we talk to customers, the demand signals there don't look anything out of the ordinary versus what we have seen historically. This because it kind of feels like we're going back to a little bit of where we were before this huge up cycle. But it's all within the normal range. I think the comment on consumer HDD was really -- it's down, it's pronounced. We can quantify it. But the other part you mentioned is it's more around the lumpiness of our supply delivery rather than demand being down. Yeah. You can go there, Matt, no problem. Yeah. Thanks. Yeah. Actually, it's a combination of both where we have very strong demand for our products. I'll cover that in a second on why that's a little bit unique to us. But then also, I would say, we're -- we have been -- we called this out a couple of quarters ago. This had been one of our more pronounced areas of delinquency, and we're starting to finally catch up. So it's a combination of both, Matt, which I think is producing a very strong result, obviously, as we guide out not only in the Q3 guide, but also the quarter we just finished. So, on the demand side, I mean, we've -- I think a couple of things, right? In our sort of classic Marvell portfolio we've had very consistent share gains and new product introductions with a lot of success in the enterprise class Ethernet switch and PHY area. In some of those cases, we sell the two products together as part of a total solution. And one trend that I think we had talked about for quite a while, and it's actually here, and it's right in front of us, and it's showing up in our numbers is the adoption of multi-gig PHY technology. The large enterprise OEMs, and you can listen to their commentary, they're seeing a big uptick. A lot of that is driven by WiFi 6, which at some point, the wireless rate line rate was going faster than the wired rate. So, that's driven a pretty big adoption. And the content and the per port has gone up dramatically as you switch to multi-gig. And it's not like 10%, 20%, 30%. It's sort of multiples on a per port basis of where it was before. And that's hitting, okay? So, you've got increased PHY content, new products ramping. We've won new customers over the last few years and we've gained share. So, that's been a good story, and it's been pretty consistent, by the way, although it's accelerated in the last few quarters. And then on top of that, a lot of the constraints we had in this area, we finally started seeing the supply improvements based on our own partnerships that we've struck with our various suppliers. And so that's starting to benefit as well. And we're finally sort of getting more caught up here. So, all-in-all, I think a great performance, obviously, out of enterprise. It's at a much higher run rate than I think certainly, people were planning or we were even thinking back at our Investor Day a year ago, but we're pleased that I think the designs we won actually have ramped up, and we still have a bright outlook from here. The final one I would say, Matt, is that we also had some new incremental business on custom-silicon and ASIC in the enterprise, which was not an area where we historically played. And those are also going to production as well, both starting this year, but even reaching full volume or not -- let's call it, run rate volume next year. So, I think a lot of new product stuff and good supply improvements. Hey. Thanks, Harlan. Yes, I think the first part of it, you got pretty well in terms of the transition on 200 and 400 gig PAM4 inside the data center. And then, the new ramps we're seeing in 400 gig ZR for DCI between data centers. What I'd add on top of that is -- which has been extremely strong and also, in some ways, a little bit of a constraint we've seen in terms of being able to keep up is, the demand on 800 gig, which is happening right now really around, obviously, very advanced AI workloads. That is an area where, if we could obviously produce more material, we would be shipping it in Q3. So that's also a positive trend. So you've got sort of the transition going on all the way up to 800 gig, and that continues to look pretty good. On the data center switching side, we are on track for the $150 million of data center switching this year. And we see very good traction in the market to -- in the solutions, we're talking about now at 51.2 with our PAM4 DSPs as kind of a total solution. So that's also going well. The team has been integrated very well into the company. Road map looks very strong. It's pretty exciting. So that was another growth vector that I did not mention upfront, but I guess you could lump -- it's not part of our 400, 800 cloud, the $1 million ramp. But that's also incremental opportunity for us in cloud switching. Yes. Yes. Well, Tore, that would be a great day. We can crack the champagne if we can get CXL, up to where the consumer or the HDD business used to be. But in all seriousness, this is new. This is a new technology transition that's happening. It's actually very exciting for the team to look at now really enabling these solutions to -- in the memory ecosystem. The -- we have a full road map that's well underway in terms of product development but it's still early. So we're still a couple of years out. And by the way, just to be clear on the opportunity, that's the SAM, we said was over time. The $1 billion-plus or multibillion. So it's still a ways out. We're not ready to sort of talk about when the timing exactly of that, but we're very encouraged. It's an absolute real trend. We intend to be a leader here. We're investing ahead of the curve. Tremendous traction on our road map and the breadth of what we can do in CXL. So it's an exciting one, and we just thought it was appropriate to flag that for investors is yet another opportunity to leverage a lot of the great technology we have into the same set of accounts. And in the case of CXL actually helped enable them, right, to architect these solutions for the future. So I think it's going to be a pretty exciting one, but it's a little ways out. And none of that is sort of in the -- like the $400 million next year, as an example. That's not part of it. That would all be incremental a few years out. Yes. And Jean, you can chime in, but I think India for us is still -- I think that's still a next year type of event, although the -- as you mentioned, the tenders have gone through. We're well positioned for that. I think we've historically through our partners, had a strong position there. But I would say it's -- the way to think about our 5G business now is more broader, diversified and a consistent performer. So I don't think you're going to see it take some enormous leap in a given quarter as an example. I mean, it's been performing extremely well. If you go all the way back to kind of the initial ramps two-plus years ago, we basically had sequential growth, I think about every quarter, except one, maybe, I don't know, seven quarters ago where we were flat or something, right? So it's -- I think, again, it's a good example maybe at a smaller scale of the diversification strategy we've tried to drive, whereas, we go into these markets, we do try to find a number of key partners to line up with such that we're -- we try to reduce volatility and perform well in any environment. So I think India is just another example. But I think there's also other geographies that are going to be laying in as well. And I think maybe even the bigger tailwind is just increased content as new systems roll out with more and more Marvell silicon per base station. I think that's really where will be a bigger impact than a particular geography ramping up in a given quarter. But Jean, any thoughts on that to add? Yeah, I think I'd have to probably get out a spreadsheet to go figure that one out, Harsh. But I think directionally, I think you're right in that. You have an estimate of what our cloud revenues are and certainly layering in the $400 million would get you to a certain number. And then you're absolutely right, what I didn't bring up is that the base business, right, which doesn't include the new wins is also ramping up. So we haven't sized that piece of it exactly, but clearly, that's going to grow as well next year, the kind of existing run rate portfolio because some of those programs whether it's in cloud switching, whether it's in electro optics, some of the things we've already talked about today that are already in the run rate are certainly going to grow. So yeah, I think that's -- I think from there, you'll have to kind of -- I think when you say 2024, I got a -- I don't know that exact number off the top of my head so. Yeah. Yes. Okay, Quinn, it's a great question. And certainly, we're very aware of kind of the broader inventory growth that's gone on in a number of the end markets that we serve. And this one, in particular, I think a couple of things give us a lot of comfort. The first is we've still been ramping into some of these new designs. So, they're not -- it's not business we had two years ago and it was at x run rate, and now it's at x times two run rate. I mean almost all of this is effectively new programs that have ramped up. I guess the silver lining is on the supply constraint so far is that we haven't been able to get over our skis on over shipping. And so -- and we continue to have escalations by the way, even within enterprise networking today, in terms of trying to meet the demand. And again, as I said, because we're in the new systems and the new programs, those are the ones typically our OEMs are the most short on, and they're trying to sell. So, I think it's a very fair question. And certainly, for somebody that's got a lot of market share in a given end market that had a run rate business, that had been going on for a while and it got inflated because of inventory growth over the last few years, one would get concerned. But that's not as much of a concern for us overall in enterprise networking today. And so I think we feel pretty good about the run rate we're on and the fact that we're running a lot farther ahead than we thought, and we still have some growth ahead of us, but we're watching it closely for sure, Quinn. No question. Yes. We're -- go ahead Jean. Yes. Great. Thanks, Joe. No, I think you're right. I think certainly -- I mean, there's independent of us, right, there's been broader constraints within the analog peer group that have caused sort of golden screw issues and things like that with -- and remains to be seen when all those sort themselves out. For our purposes, and again, some of those constraints overlap, because we do -- in some of our mixed signal technology, we do have a pretty broad usage of some of the older nodes relative to CMOS or by CMOS technology, which would be 28-nanometer, 40-nanometer, 55/65. Those have been historically over the last two years, very constrained. They continue to be constrained. We've -- but it's gotten better for sure. It's gotten better. And some of that -- some of those older nodes have been where the lumpiness of our supply has come in. You can see actually even when you look at our guide for the automotive business, those -- the five portion of that business uses some of this older technology. And you can see we're very strong sequential guide there. So that is starting to work itself out. There's still constraints where we're having a little bit more trouble. And I think some of the peers are too, is just when you get into these larger, more complex packages, Joe, that use flip-chip BGAs and large complex substrates, that's still in very rough shape. And you have to plan way in advance, even now, for the capacity that's going to be required there. That trend on ABF especially is only going to go up. And so, I think, the more complex products is where it continues to be a pain point. And I do think over time, as the cycle plays itself out, probably some of the legacy nodes and the analog stuff probably lightens up. But I think for high complexity, there's just such a move in the industry, companies like Marvell and a lot of our large peers who more and more are just producing tremendous amounts of compute power and high-performance computing broadly, whether it's in networking or custom-silicon or CPUs or GPUs, you name it, it's all going to this complex technology, and that's where we have to just continue to be tactical and keep our heads down and match supply and demand and get what we need."

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the second quarter and then provide our current attribute for the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue in the second quarter was $1.517 billion, growing 5% sequentially and 41% year-over-year. Data center was our largest end market, accounting for 42% of consolidated revenue. Enterprise networking was next largest with 22% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure and 19%, Consumer added 11% and auto industrial at 6%. GAAP gross margin was 51.8%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $986 million, increasing 41% year-over-year. Non-GAAP gross margin was 65% of revenue, slightly below the middle point due to product mix. GAAP operating expenses were $747 million, and included the cost of share-based compensation expenses of $135 million, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $88 million, an $85 million charge of contractual legal disputes segment and $7 million in other acquisition and divestiture-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $432 million, below the midpoint of our guidance. OpEx increased by 18% year-over-year as we added headcount to deliver the marketable new design we have won with key customers. We continue to drive strong operating leverage to grow OpEx to significantly less than top line revenue growth. GAAP operating income was $39 million. Our non-GAAP operating profit was $554 million, increasing by 67% from a year ago and non-GAAP operating margin was 36.5%, a record for Marvel. For the second quarter, GAAP income per diluted share was $0.01. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.57, increasing by 68% year-over-year. Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, we generated $332 million in cash from operations, reflecting our strong earnings offset by continued working capital investments to support our top line revenue growth. We have increased our inventory by $78 million to better address demand from our customers in a very tight supply chain environment and to help ensure a smooth ramp for a number of new design wins that we expect to start shipping in the next few quarters. The majority of this increase was in raw materials and with -- looking longer term, as the supply chain start to show improvement, we expect our DOI will start to decline. Consistent with our strategy to secure longer-term supply, we have increased our long-term purchase commitment for capacity to support the number of high-volume source of the design wins. Purchase commitments increased by $447 million in the second quarter to a total of approximately $3.4 billion. Please note, this commitment are over a multiyear time period. At the end of the second fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents was $617 million. We intend to maintain a higher cash balance compared to the last few years as our business has significantly increased in scale. Our total debt was $4.6 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was two times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.8 times. We returned $101 million to shareholders through $51 million in cash dividends and $50 million of share repurchase. Now, turning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect the following; revenue will be in the range of $1.56 billion, plus or minus 3%. GAAP to gross margin will be in the range of 51.1%, plus or minus 1.1%. Non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 65% plus or minus 0.25%. GAAP operating expenses will be in the range of $667 million to $677 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses will be in the range of $435 million to $440 million. At the middle point of our guidance, we expect to deliver 37% non-GAAP operating margin. We continue to make significant progress toward our long-term target of 38% to 40% non-GAAP operating margin. Other income and expense, including interest expense, will be approximately $38 million. For the third quarter, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 6%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 854 million. And our diluted weighted shares outstanding will be 862 million. As a result, we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.05 to $0.13. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.56 to $0.62. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. Yes. Hey Gary, thanks for the question. First, on the long-term purchase commitment. As Matt mentioned, right, we focus on data infrastructure. Our products tend to have a very long product cycle and most of our products were so soft. So, based on the design wins we have and the product ramp and the business planning, we struck strategic relationships with our suppliers to ensure we can secure the capacity in the longer term. So when you look at the purchase commitment, those are very long-term commitments like two, three, five to seven or even beyond the years. Our team has done a great job to really analyze what we need and what we should strike as a long-term purchase agreement. Typically, it's only a very small portion of our overall supply needs. So we actually feel very comfortable by analyzing the need, the product ramp or the customer relationship and what we are committing. If you look at it each year, it's actually very small month, right, its spread into seven years and beyond. So we feel pretty good about that. On your second question about supply chain input cost, it's still very tight supply chain environment. We continue to believe in next year we are going to continue to face challenges in complex substrate and some of the component and even older generation wafer side. So, for us, we definitely -- if there's input cost increase because of supply-demand imbalance, our strategy and our approach has been really working with our suppliers and the customers to make sure we share the cost to increase overall. So that's our current expectation. Yeah. Matt, to just add to what you just said is this year, we have seen significant growth, and the run rate is already over $600 million now. And that's actually largely benefited by North America, right? And the North American adoption of 5G has been really strong this year. Going forward, India definitely maybe next year or beyond. But Matt is right, is our 5G business will continue to be a very significant growth driver next year for us. It has a really long product cycle and the visibility actually is pretty good in this market. Hi Quinn, this is Jean. I'll answer, Matt, can add. Our cloud business are primarily US hyperscale data centers. So, we actually have a very limited revenue exposure with the Chinese hyperscale data centers today."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAshish Saran: Thank you. And good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's first quarter fiscal year 2023 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Jean Hu, our CFO.  Let me remind everyone that certain comments made today may include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?\nMatt Murphy : Thanks, Ashish. And good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Marvell team drove another record level of revenue at $1.45 billion, exceeding the midpoint of guidance growing 8% sequentially and 74% year-over-year. We saw continued strength in bookings in all our data infrastructure end markets. Higher revenue achievement was primarily driven by our datacenter market with additional strength from carrier infrastructure and automotive results, both of which were also above forecast. Due to supply-chain-related impacts, results from our enterprise networking market were below our guidance. However, growth was still very strong with revenue growing a robust 64% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. The Marvell operations team did a great job in navigating a tight supply environment that was further compounded by COVID-related manufacturing challenges at our suppliers in certain geographies. Our team's efforts were a key enabler of our first quarter revenue, exceeding the midpoint of our forecast. We continue to make progress in securing additional capacity with our strategic partners to enable sustained revenue growth. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with datacenter. In our datacenter end market, revenue for the first quarter was $640.5 million leading our guidance, having grown 12% sequentially and 131% year-over-year. Strong performance was broad based with multiple product lines contributing to excellent results. Cloud continues to be a source of Marvell's strength in the datacenter. We are enabling our hyperscale customers to add new use cases, bringing the benefits of AI and machine learning to businesses, increased process automation and productivity, and drive deeper relationships with their customers. Let me now discuss a number of Marvell product cycles driving strong growth in cloud, starting with electro optics. We are seeing strong demand for our PAM solutions inside datacenters and ZR pluggables between data centers. Inside cloud datacenters, lead Tier 1 customers are currently driving volume deployment of our PAM-based 200-gig and 400-gig solutions. The rest of the market has plans for starting deployments later this year and next year. As bandwidth requirements continue to grow, we expect the role of PAM-based electro optics to expand, replacing legacy solutions and as a result to grow our opportunity. We believe that the next generation of more powerful server CPUs will accelerate the need for PAM technology. In addition to this expansion, we are also increasing our content per module with our next generation of higher-speed solutions that we are now starting to ship. Driven by the growth in AI deployments, our first quarter results benefited from a ramp in volume shipments of our 800-gig PAM solutions at two large customers.  The bandwidth expansion inside datacenters is also driving a significant increase in connectivity between datacenters, creating a growing opportunity for our 400 ZR pluggable optics. Team is achieving great success by driving the adoption of these solutions at multiple customers, and we are projecting strong revenue growth from these products. Moving on to compute. Our cloud optimized design win momentum continued in the first quarter, and we won a custom SmartNIC at a hyperscale customer. We are seeing more adoption of VPU-based architectures inside data centers, a trend that we are ideally positioned to address with our OCTEON platform, which is now in its tenth generation. This design win is one more example of the growing demand for cloud-optimized silicon, which we see as the largest incremental growth opportunity for Marvell inside datacenters. We are confident that we are uniquely positioned to win these opportunities with our leading portfolio of compute, networking, security, storage, and high-speed electro-optics IT delivered on our 5-nanometer platform. Moving on to storage within the cloud. In the first quarter, cloud demand for high-capacity storage continued to increase, driving solid growth for our nearline HDD controllers and preamplifiers. Our SSD controllers also contributed to strong year-over-year revenue growth. We are now reaping the benefits from our datacenter SSD business, which we built from the ground up starting in 2016. We increased investment in critical IP development, accelerated our process technology cadence, and quadrupled our firmware team. Working closely with the leading cloud companies, we optimized our SSD controllers to address their quality of service and security requirements. We developed state-of-the-art error correction for the most advanced NAND flash technologies coupled them with our in-house, low-power fives and accelerated our PCIe roadmap. All the leading SSD devices today are shipping PCIe Gen 4 solutions, Marvell has already won Gen 5 data center sockets at three key NAND OEMs.  Additionally, we started investing in PCIe Gen 6 in 2019. This development, coupled with our 5-nanometer technology platform has enabled us to win a key NAND OEM for their Gen 6 SSDs. Our datacenter storage business has been built on a long and sustained period of technology investment, deep system knowledge, extensive customer relationships, and very sticky custom firmware delivered on our advanced process technology platform. We expect our position to continue to strengthen based on our proven technology platform and multiple secured design wins in the next generation of datacenter SSDs. We anticipate that the next big evolution in cloud datacenters will be the adoption of CXL or Compute XpressLink, an industry standard for connecting processors, accelerators in memory, and we are planning to enable that trend. Last week, we held a tech talk in which we explained the fundamentals of CXL technology in its role in bringing new levels of performance to next-generation cloud datacenters. If you're unable to attend, I would encourage you to watch the recording posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We described how silicon components based on CXL will facilitate new cloud architectures by addressing the multiple memory scaling challenges in current data centers.  Put simply, CXL will finally allow DRAM memory to escape the constraints of being tied down to a single compute device such as a CPU and become a shared and pulled resource, utilizing the well-established PCIe fabric as the interconnect. Marvell is uniquely positioned to address the CXL opportunity, given our deep relationships with memory OEMs, our growing position within hyperscale customers, and our advanced PCIe roadmap.  We recently bolstered our efforts in this area with the acquisition of Tanzanite, a leading developer of advanced CXL technologies. Their complementary IP and world-class team adds more resources to Marvell, accelerating our CXL road map to address opportunities in closed design wins, which are right in front of us at multiple customers. We see opportunities for a host of new products, including CXL expanders, cooling devices, switches and accelerators. In addition, we see the potential to embed CXL IP in a broad range of our datacenter products, including ASICs, custom compute engines, DPUs, electro optics, retimers, SmartNICs and SSD controllers. We see a multibillion-dollar PAM expansion opportunity driven by CXL overtime, and I look forward to updating you on our progress. Moving on to our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from our datacenter end market, we are projecting continued growth to layer on top of the strong first quarter results. We project our data center revenue in the second quarter to grow sequentially in the low-single digits on a percentage basis and year-over-year grew approximately 50%. We expect revenue from cloud to grow significantly faster than the on-premise market, both sequentially and year-over-year in the second quarter. As we progress into the second half of this fiscal year and beyond, we are looking forward to additional incremental contributions from our cloud Ethernet switches and to ramping our large set of cloud optimized custom design wins. Marvell's unique ability to offer all the critical datacenter IP under one roof, designed to work seamlessly together in a custom solution is proving very attractive to customers. As a result, our engagements with hyperscalers have moved well beyond pure ASIC programs to include various combinations of Marvell IP delivered in solutions tailored to each cloud's unique requirements. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the first quarter was $252 million, above our forecast, growing 5% sequentially and 50% year-over-year. We previously reported a substantial -- sequential step-up of over 30% in our 5G business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. From this strong base, it was great to see both sequential and year-over-year revenue growth for carrier continue in the first quarter. The growth in 5G deployment, combined with Marvell product ramps, at multiple base station customers continue to fuel strong growth in this end market. In wired, we are seeing strong demand for our 400-gig coherent electro-optics portfolio driven by rapid adoption in the metro and long-haul carrier markets. Coherent technology is critical to enabling high-speed data transmission across long distances to meet the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth from operators. Earlier this week, we announced that we have shipped over 100,000 400-gig coherent DSPs, positioning us as the leading merchant provider of these products. We are also aggressively focused on developing and launching our next generation of coherent products. This is a very key piece from the Inphi acquisition as the same technology powers the 400 ZR DCI cloud market you heard about earlier.  Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect revenue from the overall carrier end market to grow in the high-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis, while year-over-year growth is expected to remain strong at approximately 40%. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the first quarter was $286.6 million, growing 9% sequentially and 64% year-over-year as demand remains strong in this end market. While this end market represents our highest delinquency relative to the size of the business, we remain strongly focused on improving our ability to supply more products to our enterprise networking customers to help them meet their growing demand. Our growth has been driven by share gains and our increase in content starting to materialize as our customers began shipping their new platforms to address enterprise network modernization. We have seen a large increase in the adoption of our multi-gigabit fives, which have a significantly higher selling price compared to our gigabit products. We expect the penetration of multi-gigabit ports will continue to increase a tailwind to our business. Our strong growth in enterprise networking is primarily the result of our own unique product cycles.  Looking beyond this quarter, we expect growth to continue leveraging our refresh switch and PHY portfolio and incremental revenue from the ramp of custom silicon and our OCTEON ARM-based DPUs displacing alternative architectures. The second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect a continuation of strong demand for our products from the enterprise networking end market and further improvements in supply. As a result, we are projecting revenue to be up sequentially in the mid-teens on a percentage basis and year-over-year growth of approximately 45%. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the first quarter was $89.3 million, growing 12% sequentially and 94% year-over-year. All of the sequential growth came from our automotive business, which drove over 50% of the total revenue from this end market. Although we are still unable to fully satisfy the growing demand for our Brightlane Auto Ethernet solutions, the results supported by incrementally better supply solutions exceeded our guidance. Our auto revenue growth is being driven primarily by our new product cycles. The adoption of Marvell Ethernet technology in cars is continuing to increase, as OEMs design in higher-speed solutions to address the increase in bandwidth, our dollar content per car is continuing to grow. We are also winning new customers and growing our content at existing customers. We now have Ethernet design wins at eight of the 10 largest auto OEMs worldwide and 36 OEMs in total.  Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 for the combined auto and industrial end market, we are projecting sequential revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis, while year-over-year growth is expected to be over 60%. We expect strong growth to continue from our automotive business with revenue projected to more than double year-over-year.  Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the first quarter was $178.5 million, growing 7% year-over-year. The growth in this end market is being driven by our SSD controllers, partially offset by declines in our PC HDD business. On a sequential basis, revenue declined by 4% in our consumer end market, below our forecast for a flattish outlook due to a reduction in demand from the PC HDD market. While we are not the bellwether of global PC demand as it represents a relatively small amount of our revenue, we did see a rapid change in tone from the PC market, and we expect the weakness to continue. From our perspective, the shift from HDDs to SSDs in the notebook PC market is almost complete, and our revenue from notebook HDDs in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was less than 1% of consolidated Marvell revenue.  Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and our consumer end market, we expect revenue to sequentially decline in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis and be flattish year-over-year. In closing, we delivered record results for the first quarter and are guiding for continued strong growth in the second quarter. We are seeing robust demand for our products, and our design win momentum remains strong. With 88% of our revenue coming from beta infrastructure, we are confident that Marvell's favorable end market exposure makes us one of the best positioned semiconductor companies to benefit from strong secular growth trends. In the second quarter, at the midpoint of the range, we are guiding our revenue to grow by 41% year-over-year, which is almost entirely an organic comparison. We expect a strong operating leverage in our business model to drive non-GAAP EPS at the midpoint of guidance to grow by 65% year-over-year, significantly faster than our projected growth in revenue.  As you heard throughout this call, our unique product cycles have been a big part of our above-market revenue growth. As we look into the second half of this year and beyond, we are confident that our unique growth drivers in our cloud, 5G, Auto and enterprise networking end markets and our strong track record of execution through economic cycles will continue to be a source of strength. You'll remember from our prior calls and our Investor Day presentation that we have already won a significant number of design wins, which we are projecting will add a substantial amount of incremental revenue to Marvell going forward. While the external environment is challenging, Marvell's business continues to be strong, including strong bookings in our core data infrastructure end markets. As we move forward, we intend to continue to act as we always have, be diligent about changes, react promptly and manage our business and costs aggressively. On behalf of Marvell's leadership team, I thank our employees for their dedication in driving stellar results. Our employees are the backbone of the company, and we are excited that Marvell recently ranked third overall on the list of Best Places to Work in the Bay Area by the San Francisco Business Times and Silicon Valley Business Journal. Even this award is so special because it is the employees who decide the winners. We have an outstanding team, and this award reflects our culture, values and dedication to creating a collaborative workplace which fosters creativity and innovation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nJean Hu: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the first quarter and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.447 billion, exceeding the middle point of our guidance, growing 8% sequentially and 74% year-over-year. Datacenter was our largest end market driving 44% of consolidated revenue. Enterprise networking was next largest to be 20% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 18%. Consumer added 12% and the auto industrial at 6%. GAAP gross margin was 51.9%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $947 million or 65.5% of revenue, another record driven by rich product mix. GAAP operating expenses were $681 million and include the cost of share-based compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal segment and acquisition and divestiture-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $435 million reflecting the increase in R&D headcount and project expenses to execute design wins across all our data infrastructure end market. As we outlined at our Investor Day last year, we plan to continue to invest in R&D, given the tremendous opportunities we have in front of us, while keeping OpEx growth well below top line revenue growth to drive to our long-term target model. GAAP operating income was $70 million, we achieved record non-GAAP operating profit of $512 million, up 123% from a year ago, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.4%. During the first quarter, our GAAP income tax expense was $205 million. This included the impact from a onetime non-cash tax charge of $240 million offset by other tax benefits in the quarter. The $240 million non-cash tax charge was due to the measurement of our net deferred tax asset as a result for obtaining and expansion of a lower foreign restriction tax incentives. For the first quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.20. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.52, up 79% year-over-year, exceeding the middle point of our guidance.  Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $195 million as we increased our working capital investment to support the top line revenue growth in a very tight supply chain environment. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by increase in inventory, especially raw materials and work in progress help us manage it through ongoing supply chain disruption. We also made $86 million in payments during the quarter to secure long-term capacity with our suppliers.  As of the end of the first fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $465 million, and our long-term debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times, and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2 times. We returned $66 million to million in cash dividends and $15 million to share repurchase during the first quarter. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 over the first three weeks of the second quarter, we repurchased additional $50 million of our shares through our 10b-5 program. We are pleased that we have restarted the share repurchase program as we believe it's in the best interest of the company and our long-term shareholders.  In summary, the Marvell team executed exceptionally well delivering accelerated top-line revenue growth and strong earnings expansion significantly faster than revenue growth.  Turning to our guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $1.515 billion plus or minus 3%. GAAP gross margin in the range of 49.6% to 51.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 65% to 65.5%. GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $669 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $435 million, which assumes that we will complete the acquisition of in the second quarter.  For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP tax rate of 6%. We expect our basic weighted average share outstanding will be 853 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 862 million. As a result, we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.02 to $0.10. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.53 to $0.59.  Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nToshiya Hari : Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congrats on the strong execution. Matt, I was hoping you could speak to your expectations for the second half, both from a demand perspective and a supply perspective. I think last quarter, there was a little bit of confusion as it pertains to the full year outlook. So, if you can kind of confirm how you're thinking about your overall business, but particularly datacenter into the second half, that would be super helpful and then again if you have the supply to support the strong outlook. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy : Yeah. Thanks, Toshiya. Great to hear from you. Yeah, so we're pleased with the results and execution in Q2. And -- I'm sorry, in Q1. And as you saw, we had a very strong quarter in datacenter, which I'll come back to in a minute. But just to kind of reframe from the demand side in all of our end markets, except consumer, we see very strong demand trends, Toshiya. Bookings have been very strong in the last two quarters. Demand -- our demand outlook for the year continues to be strong. And with respect to datacenter specifically, we did have a strong Q1 better than expected.  We still have pent-up demand and lack of supply there for the second quarter, but we expect actually a reacceleration in the datacenter in terms of our growth in Q3 and Q4, i.e., the second half. And on top of that, we have incremental new design wins that we've secured over the last 12 to 18 months, which we've sized roughly at, call it, $400 million incremental next year and $800 million the year after. That's actually going to start layering in as well in the second half.  So from our perspective, ex-consumer demand continues to be very strong. Datacenter in particular is going to have a great first half and a great second half. And then relative to supply, we really, first of all, credit to our operations team doing a great job in the first quarter, navigating all of the different impacts going on, in particular, in China and delivering a strong quarter. Looking forward, we're starting to see the benefit of all the investment we put in over the last year into our supply chain. Whether that be the improvement in systems and tools, the relationships and the capacity that we've secured, and so we believe that, that's going to continue. And we do see a much improved supply outlook not only in the short term as you can see from our results both beating in our Q1 and then guiding strongly for Q2, but also in the second half, Toshiya. And again, I think that's the result of a lot of hard work and transformation in our supply chain to meet our growth plans.  So, in summary, we have very strong demand driven by datacenter but also in 5G and automotive and the other things we've talked about and we've seen real improvements in our visibility into the supply we're going to get to go meet that customer demand.\nToshiya Hari : Great. Thanks for all the details. \nMatt Murphy : Yep.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nChris Caso : Yeah. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the enterprise networking business. And I guess it came in a little below your expectations, but yet you're still speaking about supply constraints in that area. Is that a situation where your customers are supply constrained elsewhere and you're waiting for them? Maybe just give some explanation of the dynamics in that part of the business.\nMatt Murphy : Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Yeah, this was definitely a quarter where the mix wasn't exactly where we thought it was going to be from when we guided. As you could see, we overachieved in datacenter and we underachieved on enterprise. But as I pointed out in my comments, the delinquency and kind of the unfulfilled backlog relative to the size of the business is actually still the highest in enterprise.  So this was really a case of just us being unable to execute our supply plan for the quarter nothing to do with demand. In fact, the demand from our enterprise customers continues to be very robust looking into the second quarter and throughout the year. So it was nothing to do with them. They want more of our product, and you can see somewhat of a catch-up in Q2 with a very strong guide sequentially into the second quarter. But we see that continuing, Chris. So, I know there's been a lot of noise out there around enterprise, but from our perspective and talking to our customers, demand remains very strong. And in fact, we're behind in terms of our supply to catch up. But I think consistent with what Toshi was asking, we are looking to improve that in the second quarter and also through the second half.\nChris Caso : Thank you. \nMatt Murphy : Yep.\nOperator: The next question is from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nGary Mobley : Hey, thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the good results. Wanted to ask about the supply situation and you just articulated improving supply coming online for the balance of the year. To what extent is that being driven by you perhaps giving your foundry partners a better forecast? How much of it is being driven by maybe you growing some more money their way in prepayments? And to what extent is it being influenced by some shifting of fungible capacity as the semiconductor market is no longer universally strong. So maybe you're benefiting for redistribution of supply?\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Excellent question. And I think there's probably a piece of all of that. I think when I look back over what we've accomplished, one is we had to do a fairly significant education process across the supply chain of Marvell's prospects, how all the different pieces have come together from the different M&A we've done, our end market focus, et cetera. And so I think we did a good job of that of getting the broader supply chain ecosystem to understand the Marvell opportunity. And so, to a large extent, they're betting on us and they're supporting our growth.  And you can see that, right, just in terms of the year-over-year growth we're achieving, which by the way is off of a pretty strong year we had last year. So that's clearly a factor. We have also signed agreements relative to securing capacity. And you can see some of those that have shown up in our Q or 8-Ks we've issued partnerships we've entered into. So some of that has been down payments and supply agreements to ensure that we have the right capacity. I think that's some part of it.  And then it's hard to say, but on the last part of it, the sort of fungibility that may be coming into play a little bit, but it's too early to say. And quite frankly, the supply we're seeing today is we can really mostly attribute that to sort of our own effort. I will say, and just to be very clear for everybody on the call, we're not out of the woods here. Our unfulfilled backlog has continued to grow each quarter. We're definitely working that down. We're focused very much on the end demand and shipping to the right people. And we feel like we've done a good job of that in terms of keeping our customers' lines moving and not causing impacts and being very agile. But I think to the extent that on that third point, the fungibility side, if there were to be a true reduction or capitulation, let's call it, the PC and consumer end market and not needing all the supply they've consumed, that certainly could be an incremental thing we could look at in the second half. But that -- that's not quite there yet, but maybe some of it is. We do see pockets of things opening up, but it's really hard when you sort of drill into it where it exactly came from. Hope that's helpful. Kind of a combination that you sort of nailed it comes of the mid.\nGary Mobley : Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: The next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri : Thanks. Matt, I have just a broad question kind of on demand signals. To some degree, because supply has been so tight, it does create the potential that some of the orders, and I'm not saying for you, but I'm just saying broadly, are being placed just to secure their spot in line and not really backed by underlying sell-through at the customer or even the customer's customer level. And it sort of creates the risk that the chip companies are going to see more of a delay in sort of the demand signals at this time. I think it's less of a risk for you. But I guess my question is, how do you assess that as a risk? And really, the question, I guess, is on the tenor of your discussions with your customers? Do you get the sense that there are some examples of customers placing bookings just to get in the queue because you have such long lead times? I asked because some of the big large cloud customers are beginning to slow some of their hiring, things like that. So I'm just wondering what the tenor is of your talks with them. Thanks.\nMatt Murphy : Sure, Tim. Yeah. No, it's not unlike other cycles, where certainly the phenomena you point out, and this is the investor concern, right, more broadly in semis is have customers over-indexed on their order placements. And what happens when demand stops or slows down. So we've taken this very seriously.  I mean I just did a pretty much half a day review in the last few weeks with my entire team going through each of our product lines, going through to the customers and really kind of working through at an individual level where we still see the demand? Do we see any inventory building up? If so, what does it look like in that type of an exercise? And what I can tell you is there's no real examples I could point to, Tim, or anything thematic. I guess in some ways, we may have the benefit that we've been somewhat behind although I think we've done a good job of keeping everybody's lines moving. But certainly, we haven't been the company that's been swimming in capacity. So I think as we look out now, especially where the kind of global economy is beginning to moderate. We're able to kind of take a look now and do a refresh, especially with our improved supply situation and really make sure we're allocating it to the right people.  So it's a very active process, Tim, but I can't give you any nuggets of specific examples where I think thematically inventory may be building. But I guess I would conclude by saying we did -- we were pretty transparent in the prepared remarks about what we saw in the consumer segment, which albeit it's 12% of the business. And of that, a smaller portion of it is really exposed to what I would call kind of true consumer like PCs and things like that, but that did very much slow down. There definitely was a change in demand. And as a result, some supply that had there some inventory that had built up but we've got other moving pieces even with consumer that's sort of offsetting it. So a long way of answering it. I don't have any great examples, but we're on it. We're watching it. But I'd say the bulk of the meeting, to be honest, when I had it was the demand signals being very strong, right, across the cloud companies across our 5G business, enterprise wired. There's a lot of great opportunities for us. And a lot of this, Tim, is driven on Marvell's product cycles. It's not necessarily an end market phenomena we're dealing with here. It's really the new product ramps that you're very aware of across these different segments, and those seem very much intact in aggregate.\nTimothy Arcuri : Thanks, Matt. Yes, I mean, I think in the continuum of companies that have risk, you're at the kind of bottom of the list. But thanks for the questions or the answers. Thanks. \nMatt Murphy : Yeah. \nOperator: The next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya : Yeah. Thank you for taking my question. Just wanted to clarify, Matt, if you have seen already or are baking in any supply or demand effects of the China lockdown or Europe turmoil. But my bigger question is, how do we conceptually align this notion of rising delinquency or unmet demand with rising inventory at both on semiconductor company balance sheet and even at some of the large networking OEMs, at what point does this rising inventory across the supply chain start to become a concern?\nMatt Murphy : Great. Thanks, Vivek. Yes. On the first question, again, we're -- as you know, based on the timing of our reporting, we're like everybody else who's going right now. We had the month of April to comprehend in there relative to the China lockdown. And we navigated it really well. I think one of the reasons for us is that when COVID first happened, when the pandemic first began and there was major lockdowns everywhere China, including and also Southeast Asia, our operations team did a really good job of building up supply chain redundancy and resiliency over the last two years.  So effectively dual sourced almost everything we can coming in and out of China and even some of the other regions over there. So there was some impact. There was a little bit of product revenue where could we have gotten supply out of China, we could have fulfilled it, but it was very small, Vivek, to be honest with you. So we're able to be fairly agile in terms of moving things around.  So that was a positive. On the war in Ukraine and the impact on kind of in the again, I think you're hearing the data points, right? We don't see it directly, but certainly on the slowdown in the consumer segment, people's budgets being pinched, things like that. I think that's part of the issue with some of the consumer end market commentary. Again, we're not really in there. And we don't have operations in Ukraine or Russia. So we didn't really have any impact on that. So I think we're okay there. On the commentary on rising inventory, look, I'm very aware of this. You can pull everybody's Qs out and look at -- and one simple thing we do is look and OEM companies\u2019 inventory growth. And you can see across a wide range of companies and industries, growth in inventory far exceeding revenue growth. So that is something we're paying attention to. We're using that to dive in deep with our customers. But I would say that our view tends to be like a lot of our customers, which is the end demand, especially in enterprise, in cloud and in our product cycle in 5G, the demand looks pretty strong. But there is -- there are missing pieces. There is the golden screw issue for sure that some of our customers have. We're just trying not to be the golden screw and also be very kind of clear eyed about where the inventory is and what does that mean for Marvell. And so I can tell you is we're digging into it at a part level detail and making sure that we're being prudent about where we allocate the supply. But it is something we got to keep watching for sure.\nJean Hu: Yeah. And to add to what Matt said is we actually chose to increase our inventory to support the revenue growth in the second half. We have a very broad set of product lines, and we see strong demand. So the flexibility we need to have raw materials and the way to support the revenue growth is really critical. So we did choose that to make sure we can support the customers and the future revenue growth.\nVivek Arya : Do you have a target Jean on days of inventory?\nJean Hu: The current level is what we are comfortable. We think we can help and manage the supplies for the second half. I think if the environment is normalized, we definitely will have a lower inventory like 120 days. That's what we think we should keep. But right now, we definitely chose to increase it to provide more flexibility.\nVivek Arya : Thanks very much. \nMatt Murphy : Yeah. Vivek, just to chime in on Jean's comments, I fully agree. If you look at just the steepness of the revenue ramp we're dealing with. Clearly, the WIP has to go up, right, just to sort of support the growth. So that part we're comfortable with. And given the given the lockdowns and all the volatility, I think having that extra inventory carry for us is very prudent. And we watch it, and we'll certainly work it down. But I don't think you're going to see many companies go back to the good old days of 80 days or something like that, unless they truly get into trouble. I just think for a while, we're all going to have to be mindful that there's a lot of volatility in the world. But we're sort of in the range now, and we're very conscious in terms of what we're doing here.\nVivek Arya : Thank you. \nOperator: The next question is from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Ramsay : Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Matt, in part of your script, you had talked about the upcoming server launches that include a couple of new technologies, right, and then some CXL support for shared memory. And I think you guys have done a great job of articulating what that might mean for your Accelerator business and given us some outlook there. I was curious if you might explain a little bit about what PCIe 5 might drive for support of that technology into the storage and network peripherals. Is that material to the growth in the back half?  And how much visibility do you have there? Just -- and then just a quick follow-up, question I get all the time is visibility on cloud CapEx. If you guys look out in your cloud business, is it quarters, years? Like how long are we talking that you feel like you have visibility because there's definitely some concerns there. I appreciate it. Thank you. \nMatt Murphy : Hey, Matt. Good to hear from you, and good questions. Yes, I think you did nail it on one of the more important aspects of the upcoming CPU cycles is the IO, right, and the release of PCIe Gen 5 and we've certainly been preparing for that. That is a key part of the equation for us, particularly, as you can imagine, in our storage business and our datacenter storage business, which One of the key things we have to align to on our product roadmap is obviously nailing the PCIe IO road map, and it's not a trivial thing, not only the controller, but obviously the PHY and getting everything qualified and working. And so our team has done a great job there. We're very well positioned in storage on PCIe Gen 5 actually said in my remarks, we've already got wins lined up on Gen 6. That's still a ways out, but that's going to be another leg of growth. And you're right, the PCIe standard is really going to be the fabric and the interconnect that CXL runs on top of. And so a lot of the effort we put in on both Gen 5 and in the future, Gen 6 is going to give us tremendous leverage as we think about disaggregation, particularly of memory and these different solutions that are going to emerge around CXL. So it's very strategic. We do -- we always make make-or-buy decisions on things in terms of make versus buy, sorry, on technologies, but this is one, particularly on the PHY layer for PCIe that we've -- we do ourselves, and we have -- we're best-in-class in what we do here, and then we leverage that into our larger SOCs. So -- but I think the biggest impact from Marvell will be just driving broader adoption of our data center flash controllers, which again, are well positioned across a number of NAND OEMs. And products defined directly with the cloud OEMs going back several years, right, to get all this lined up. So it's going to be a good cycle for us. And then sorry, on cloud CapEx, I don't have any insight. I -- we certainly look at all the publicly available data. The most recent update certainly looked promising. But I would say for Marvell, Matt, and for the rest of the investors on the call, we're -- of course, the overall CapEx environment in cloud can certainly be a tailwind and that could be a headwind for anybody that supplies into there. But -- you got to remember, most of our revenue coming from the cloud is really in new product cycles that are very Marvell-specific in some cases. I mean, let's take let's take PAM, for example. If you went back a year ago, you really had a couple of companies deploying it versus older NRZ-based solutions. You head into this year, there are now additional companies as well that are going to be driving that cycle on 200 and 400-gig. We have new applications like even 800-gig as an example, for AI clusters and things like that where we started ramping our 800-gig product.  So whether the CapEx goes up or down, there's new applications and new replacement cycles that are going on. And then there's just other things like, for example, in our Cloud Ethernet switch area, right? There was new wins we got through the Innovium team that joined us last year. We expect continued strong growth from that product area. We have new cloud optimized silicon in ASICs and DPUs that were designed in over the last couple of years. Those are going to be ramping up. So we are very -- we're paying attention to it, Matt, but I would say that that it's a little bit like our 5G business. You can see things go up and down and lumpiness in the market. But when you have a strong product cycle with either content or share gain and new customers coming on, you can power through and that's our full expectation in the cloud. We have very strong conviction on our business there today, particularly in the second half and next year relative to the cloud hyperscale and we'll watch the CapEx trend, but most of our products are independent of that trend.\nMatt Ramsay : Thanks, Matt. Appreciate all the color. \nMatt Murphy : Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nRoss Seymore : Hey, guys. Thanks for letting us ask a question. Jean, I wanted to ask you one on the margin side of the equation. You guys always run a very tight ship in this, but there's lots of moving parts. Matt's talked a lot about more supply coming on in the back half of this year. Sometimes that can come at a higher price these days. And then even the OpEx side of things, wage inflation, et cetera, and some acquisition integration that you talked about. So generally speaking, can you walk us through the puts and takes on the gross margin and the OpEx side of things for the rest of the year?\nJean Hu: Yeah. Ross, thanks for the question. I think our team has been very disciplined to manage OpEx to make sure we follow our overall business model right, grow revenue significantly faster than OpEx growth and keep the gross margin right in the middle or even above the middle of our long-term target model, so we can drive the earnings expansion much faster than top line revenue growth.  When you look at the OpEx in Q1, as I said earlier, we increased headcount and project expense to really execute on all the design wins we have won. Q2, it's we keep it flat. In the second half, it's going to go a little bit higher, slightly higher, but it's largely because we are going to grow revenue in second half to support the revenue growth, you have certain variable expenses that will increase slightly in second half. In the longer term, you should continue to expect us to drive top-line revenue growth and OpEx around 50% slower than top line revenue growth. So we can continue to get the earnings expansion.  So in Q2, if you look at the midpoint of our guide, our operating margin is already above 36%. We are very, very driven to get our operating model to the 38% to 40% range.\nRoss Seymore : Thank you. \nOperator: Next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTore Svanberg : Yeah, thank you. And Congratulations on the strong results. Just had a follow-up on the storage question, but this time on Gen 6, not on Gen 5. So just, Matt, can you maybe frame a little bit Marvell's positioning here? I mean I think about the PAM4 IP you have, obviously, you talked about CXL. I know it's still early days, but if you could just frame a little bit sort of layman's terms, you\u2019re positioned for PCI Gen 6, that would be great. Thank you. \nMatt Murphy : Sure, Tore. Yeah, Gen 6, as it relates to storage, you're absolutely right. Given the increase in IO throughput and data rate, you had to move to a PAM-based architecture. So that's played right into our strengths. We've coupled that with our -- and we were early to do this, by the way, with our 5-nanometer technology platform. And so there's just a whole lot of goodness and reuse there, as you can imagine. And it really put us in a strong position to get there early, and I give our storage business unit, a lot of credit for really having thought leadership here. I mean they probably jumped like two nodes on everybody, not that it's a whole node game, but in terms of just the power and the performance that we're getting out of these solutions. And then, of course, the benefit we get to take the IO down to 5-nanometer and leveraging PAM is actually a huge help, right, just given the given the complexity. And you saw that in our optical business, right, and kind of how Inphi drove performance over time as they've driven PAM on new process node, same thing over here. So I think that's going to be very strategic. And yeah, I think that that platform now -- again, we're early, right? We're just talking about launch today, but we do like to give color on our future leaning roadmap. But it definitely plays to our strengths. And I think as you think about also what's going to be required in CXL. I think even things like closing the link and the need for retimers and re-drivers, accelerators, pooling applications, they're all going to require robust Gen 6 IP and then be able to integrate those into various different SoCs. And I would just say even today, the CXL activity we're seeing in terms of our design opportunities is pretty broad, and it's almost all -- it really is all in our 5-nanometer platform.  So it all kind of hangs together, Tore, and maybe I think you sort of see this, but I think others are as well. The combination of all the IPs that we brought together through the different acquisitions plus the Marvell technology platform has really created an opportunity for us to go-to-market with these semi-custom solutions and be very successful in this next wave of cloud optimized silicon.\nTore Svanberg : Excellent, thank you. \nOperator: Next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur : Good afternoon. Great job on the quarterly execution. I saw the announcement on -- and you mentioned this map on shipping 100,000 400-gig coherent DSP chipsets. You're pretty early days in this transition, but you guys have already shipped like according to my calculation, almost $200 million plus worth of products. And the great thing about this family of products is that they've got the same underlying architecture and you've taken that and you're going after different markets, right?  Datacenter interconnect with for 400 ZR, long-haul metro with your 400-gig Canopus solution. The adoption seems to be actually on a faster curve. Is this a driver of the upside in your datacenter and carrier franchises? And then I believe that your deployment is being driven by just one cloud titan, are you guys anticipating other cloud titans starting to fire as the year unfolds?\nMatt Murphy : Yeah. Thanks, Harlan, for the question. And maybe just to start at the top on coherent DSP. I'm not sure everybody quite understood. Even the Inphi people that followed Inphi closely, how strategic this technology is. A little bit of background. They had had their own effort in coherent Inphi, and they ended up acquiring a company called ClariPhy a few years before we acquired Inphi. And ultimately, they chose to ClariPhy coherent DSP road map. This is very, very difficult stuff to do, Harlan. And once you get it right and get it designed in, these are very, very long product life cycles, particularly in the metro long-haul type of markets, the telco type markets. And that's really what's driving -- that's really where the revenue is showing up today for this. The added benefit is obviously the same technology and chips are used in the ZR 400 the ZR market as well for DCI. So there's a double benefit here. And so on the merchant side, we're a strong leader. We have a road map, obviously, beyond this to 800-gig. That's going to play in well to our next-generation DCI products as well. And then even longer term, there's discussions longer term about the modulation technology eventually inside datacenter moving to coherent. So it's a very strategic technology for Marvell.  And to answer your question on the ZR DCI side, we -- and I said it in my prepared remarks that it might have begun lost, but we do have multiple customers for this, not just one. And those will be ramping up over the next year or so, the additional customers. We're already shipping and putting out record results on the DCI products as it is. We're really driven by one customer, but there's more coming.  So we're pretty excited about this. And we have a whole ecosystem lined up, right? We have a number of module partners for different applications. And so -- anyway, yes, it's something we'll be talking about more. Maybe we'll do a tech talk on that one, too, Harlan, but it's actually a really important technology that we got from Inphi. And it's obviously an outstanding team that really feeds a lot of the other things that we do inside the company.\nHarlan Sur : Yeah. Great insights. Thank you, Matt.\nMatt Murphy : Yeah. And just 1 final thing, I would say, remember, too, this is a chip set as well. So it's not just the DSP, it's the driver, it's the TIA and there's even other components we're looking at to really optimize the solution. So when you hang all that together and you can deliver it as a platform. It\u2019s very powerful.\nHarlan Sur : Perfect. Thank you. \nMatt Murphy : Welcome. \nOperator: The final question today will be from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nCJ Muse: Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the questions and squeezing me in. I guess a question on gross margins. You guided down 25 bps sequentially. Obviously, a very small amount. But just curious if there's anything mix-wise and/or higher input costs that we should be thinking about there? And then just as a quick follow-up to Jean, are we at the net leverage level now where you plan to return free cash flow via buybacks? Or is that still in more of the opportunistic phase? Thank you.\nJean Hu : Yeah. So CJ, thanks for the question. First, on the net leverage, if you look at our Q2 guidance at the middle point of our guidance our net leverage ratio will be below 2, gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be around 2, but the net leverage will be below 2. As I said earlier, we have restarted share repurchase program even after end of Q1, subsequently, we did purchase additional $50 million through our 10b-5 program.  So our capital allocation principle is still the same, right? We want to invest, but we are also committed to return more than 50% free cash flow to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. On the gross margin, our gross margin, we are very pleased with the Q1 gross margin, which is a record in the Q2 guide it's all both above middle point for our long-term target. So the Q2 is really just a mix. We have so many different product lines quarter-over-quarter, you will see the mix change up and down of our middle point I would not predict that closely. But in general, it should be around 65% sometimes higher.\nMatt Murphy : I'll just add, C.J. I totally agree with Jean, obviously. And just to remind everybody, we set a range of -- on gross margins as our target model of 64% to 66%. We had a record 65.3% in Q4. Then we had another record of 65.5% in Q1, and then we're guiding 65.25% if you look at the midpoint in Q2. So it's kind of in in the range, if you know what I mean, I think run the company around that 65-ish is a really good place to be. If we can continue to grow the company the way we're growing it and drive leverage and drive design wins and stay competitive. So I think it's -- I think we're in pretty good shape. I think obviously reasonable to ask the question, but I think, as Jean said, we're going to have little movements here and there on mix. And we're ultimately just focused on keeping it in the right range in the right strike zone and then just driving really strong top-line growth and driving operating leverage through the cycle we're in here.\nCJ Muse: Thank you. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session, and the conference has also now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Matt Murphy",
            "content": "Thanks, Ashish. And good afternoon, everyone. In the first quarter of fiscal 2023, the Marvell team drove another record level of revenue at $1.45 billion, exceeding the midpoint of guidance growing 8% sequentially and 74% year-over-year. We saw continued strength in bookings in all our data infrastructure end markets. Higher revenue achievement was primarily driven by our datacenter market with additional strength from carrier infrastructure and automotive results, both of which were also above forecast. Due to supply-chain-related impacts, results from our enterprise networking market were below our guidance. However, growth was still very strong with revenue growing a robust 64% year-over-year and 9% sequentially. The Marvell operations team did a great job in navigating a tight supply environment that was further compounded by COVID-related manufacturing challenges at our suppliers in certain geographies. Our team's efforts were a key enabler of our first quarter revenue, exceeding the midpoint of our forecast. We continue to make progress in securing additional capacity with our strategic partners to enable sustained revenue growth. Let me now move on to discussing our five end markets, starting with datacenter. In our datacenter end market, revenue for the first quarter was $640.5 million leading our guidance, having grown 12% sequentially and 131% year-over-year. Strong performance was broad based with multiple product lines contributing to excellent results. Cloud continues to be a source of Marvell's strength in the datacenter. We are enabling our hyperscale customers to add new use cases, bringing the benefits of AI and machine learning to businesses, increased process automation and productivity, and drive deeper relationships with their customers. Let me now discuss a number of Marvell product cycles driving strong growth in cloud, starting with electro optics. We are seeing strong demand for our PAM solutions inside datacenters and ZR pluggables between data centers. Inside cloud datacenters, lead Tier 1 customers are currently driving volume deployment of our PAM-based 200-gig and 400-gig solutions. The rest of the market has plans for starting deployments later this year and next year. As bandwidth requirements continue to grow, we expect the role of PAM-based electro optics to expand, replacing legacy solutions and as a result to grow our opportunity. We believe that the next generation of more powerful server CPUs will accelerate the need for PAM technology. In addition to this expansion, we are also increasing our content per module with our next generation of higher-speed solutions that we are now starting to ship. Driven by the growth in AI deployments, our first quarter results benefited from a ramp in volume shipments of our 800-gig PAM solutions at two large customers.  The bandwidth expansion inside datacenters is also driving a significant increase in connectivity between datacenters, creating a growing opportunity for our 400 ZR pluggable optics. Team is achieving great success by driving the adoption of these solutions at multiple customers, and we are projecting strong revenue growth from these products. Moving on to compute. Our cloud optimized design win momentum continued in the first quarter, and we won a custom SmartNIC at a hyperscale customer. We are seeing more adoption of VPU-based architectures inside data centers, a trend that we are ideally positioned to address with our OCTEON platform, which is now in its tenth generation. This design win is one more example of the growing demand for cloud-optimized silicon, which we see as the largest incremental growth opportunity for Marvell inside datacenters. We are confident that we are uniquely positioned to win these opportunities with our leading portfolio of compute, networking, security, storage, and high-speed electro-optics IT delivered on our 5-nanometer platform. Moving on to storage within the cloud. In the first quarter, cloud demand for high-capacity storage continued to increase, driving solid growth for our nearline HDD controllers and preamplifiers. Our SSD controllers also contributed to strong year-over-year revenue growth. We are now reaping the benefits from our datacenter SSD business, which we built from the ground up starting in 2016. We increased investment in critical IP development, accelerated our process technology cadence, and quadrupled our firmware team. Working closely with the leading cloud companies, we optimized our SSD controllers to address their quality of service and security requirements. We developed state-of-the-art error correction for the most advanced NAND flash technologies coupled them with our in-house, low-power fives and accelerated our PCIe roadmap. All the leading SSD devices today are shipping PCIe Gen 4 solutions, Marvell has already won Gen 5 data center sockets at three key NAND OEMs.  Additionally, we started investing in PCIe Gen 6 in 2019. This development, coupled with our 5-nanometer technology platform has enabled us to win a key NAND OEM for their Gen 6 SSDs. Our datacenter storage business has been built on a long and sustained period of technology investment, deep system knowledge, extensive customer relationships, and very sticky custom firmware delivered on our advanced process technology platform. We expect our position to continue to strengthen based on our proven technology platform and multiple secured design wins in the next generation of datacenter SSDs. We anticipate that the next big evolution in cloud datacenters will be the adoption of CXL or Compute XpressLink, an industry standard for connecting processors, accelerators in memory, and we are planning to enable that trend. Last week, we held a tech talk in which we explained the fundamentals of CXL technology in its role in bringing new levels of performance to next-generation cloud datacenters. If you're unable to attend, I would encourage you to watch the recording posted in the Investor Relations section of our website. We described how silicon components based on CXL will facilitate new cloud architectures by addressing the multiple memory scaling challenges in current data centers.  Put simply, CXL will finally allow DRAM memory to escape the constraints of being tied down to a single compute device such as a CPU and become a shared and pulled resource, utilizing the well-established PCIe fabric as the interconnect. Marvell is uniquely positioned to address the CXL opportunity, given our deep relationships with memory OEMs, our growing position within hyperscale customers, and our advanced PCIe roadmap.  We recently bolstered our efforts in this area with the acquisition of Tanzanite, a leading developer of advanced CXL technologies. Their complementary IP and world-class team adds more resources to Marvell, accelerating our CXL road map to address opportunities in closed design wins, which are right in front of us at multiple customers. We see opportunities for a host of new products, including CXL expanders, cooling devices, switches and accelerators. In addition, we see the potential to embed CXL IP in a broad range of our datacenter products, including ASICs, custom compute engines, DPUs, electro optics, retimers, SmartNICs and SSD controllers. We see a multibillion-dollar PAM expansion opportunity driven by CXL overtime, and I look forward to updating you on our progress. Moving on to our expectations for the second quarter of fiscal 2023 from our datacenter end market, we are projecting continued growth to layer on top of the strong first quarter results. We project our data center revenue in the second quarter to grow sequentially in the low-single digits on a percentage basis and year-over-year grew approximately 50%. We expect revenue from cloud to grow significantly faster than the on-premise market, both sequentially and year-over-year in the second quarter. As we progress into the second half of this fiscal year and beyond, we are looking forward to additional incremental contributions from our cloud Ethernet switches and to ramping our large set of cloud optimized custom design wins. Marvell's unique ability to offer all the critical datacenter IP under one roof, designed to work seamlessly together in a custom solution is proving very attractive to customers. As a result, our engagements with hyperscalers have moved well beyond pure ASIC programs to include various combinations of Marvell IP delivered in solutions tailored to each cloud's unique requirements. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the first quarter was $252 million, above our forecast, growing 5% sequentially and 50% year-over-year. We previously reported a substantial -- sequential step-up of over 30% in our 5G business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. From this strong base, it was great to see both sequential and year-over-year revenue growth for carrier continue in the first quarter. The growth in 5G deployment, combined with Marvell product ramps, at multiple base station customers continue to fuel strong growth in this end market. In wired, we are seeing strong demand for our 400-gig coherent electro-optics portfolio driven by rapid adoption in the metro and long-haul carrier markets. Coherent technology is critical to enabling high-speed data transmission across long distances to meet the ever-increasing demand for bandwidth from operators. Earlier this week, we announced that we have shipped over 100,000 400-gig coherent DSPs, positioning us as the leading merchant provider of these products. We are also aggressively focused on developing and launching our next generation of coherent products. This is a very key piece from the Inphi acquisition as the same technology powers the 400 ZR DCI cloud market you heard about earlier.  Looking ahead to the second quarter, we expect revenue from the overall carrier end market to grow in the high-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis, while year-over-year growth is expected to remain strong at approximately 40%. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the first quarter was $286.6 million, growing 9% sequentially and 64% year-over-year as demand remains strong in this end market. While this end market represents our highest delinquency relative to the size of the business, we remain strongly focused on improving our ability to supply more products to our enterprise networking customers to help them meet their growing demand. Our growth has been driven by share gains and our increase in content starting to materialize as our customers began shipping their new platforms to address enterprise network modernization. We have seen a large increase in the adoption of our multi-gigabit fives, which have a significantly higher selling price compared to our gigabit products. We expect the penetration of multi-gigabit ports will continue to increase a tailwind to our business. Our strong growth in enterprise networking is primarily the result of our own unique product cycles.  Looking beyond this quarter, we expect growth to continue leveraging our refresh switch and PHY portfolio and incremental revenue from the ramp of custom silicon and our OCTEON ARM-based DPUs displacing alternative architectures. The second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect a continuation of strong demand for our products from the enterprise networking end market and further improvements in supply. As a result, we are projecting revenue to be up sequentially in the mid-teens on a percentage basis and year-over-year growth of approximately 45%. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue for the first quarter was $89.3 million, growing 12% sequentially and 94% year-over-year. All of the sequential growth came from our automotive business, which drove over 50% of the total revenue from this end market. Although we are still unable to fully satisfy the growing demand for our Brightlane Auto Ethernet solutions, the results supported by incrementally better supply solutions exceeded our guidance. Our auto revenue growth is being driven primarily by our new product cycles. The adoption of Marvell Ethernet technology in cars is continuing to increase, as OEMs design in higher-speed solutions to address the increase in bandwidth, our dollar content per car is continuing to grow. We are also winning new customers and growing our content at existing customers. We now have Ethernet design wins at eight of the 10 largest auto OEMs worldwide and 36 OEMs in total.  Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 for the combined auto and industrial end market, we are projecting sequential revenue growth in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis, while year-over-year growth is expected to be over 60%. We expect strong growth to continue from our automotive business with revenue projected to more than double year-over-year.  Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the first quarter was $178.5 million, growing 7% year-over-year. The growth in this end market is being driven by our SSD controllers, partially offset by declines in our PC HDD business. On a sequential basis, revenue declined by 4% in our consumer end market, below our forecast for a flattish outlook due to a reduction in demand from the PC HDD market. While we are not the bellwether of global PC demand as it represents a relatively small amount of our revenue, we did see a rapid change in tone from the PC market, and we expect the weakness to continue. From our perspective, the shift from HDDs to SSDs in the notebook PC market is almost complete, and our revenue from notebook HDDs in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 was less than 1% of consolidated Marvell revenue.  Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2023 and our consumer end market, we expect revenue to sequentially decline in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis and be flattish year-over-year. In closing, we delivered record results for the first quarter and are guiding for continued strong growth in the second quarter. We are seeing robust demand for our products, and our design win momentum remains strong. With 88% of our revenue coming from beta infrastructure, we are confident that Marvell's favorable end market exposure makes us one of the best positioned semiconductor companies to benefit from strong secular growth trends. In the second quarter, at the midpoint of the range, we are guiding our revenue to grow by 41% year-over-year, which is almost entirely an organic comparison. We expect a strong operating leverage in our business model to drive non-GAAP EPS at the midpoint of guidance to grow by 65% year-over-year, significantly faster than our projected growth in revenue.  As you heard throughout this call, our unique product cycles have been a big part of our above-market revenue growth. As we look into the second half of this year and beyond, we are confident that our unique growth drivers in our cloud, 5G, Auto and enterprise networking end markets and our strong track record of execution through economic cycles will continue to be a source of strength. You'll remember from our prior calls and our Investor Day presentation that we have already won a significant number of design wins, which we are projecting will add a substantial amount of incremental revenue to Marvell going forward. While the external environment is challenging, Marvell's business continues to be strong, including strong bookings in our core data infrastructure end markets. As we move forward, we intend to continue to act as we always have, be diligent about changes, react promptly and manage our business and costs aggressively. On behalf of Marvell's leadership team, I thank our employees for their dedication in driving stellar results. Our employees are the backbone of the company, and we are excited that Marvell recently ranked third overall on the list of Best Places to Work in the Bay Area by the San Francisco Business Times and Silicon Valley Business Journal. Even this award is so special because it is the employees who decide the winners. We have an outstanding team, and this award reflects our culture, values and dedication to creating a collaborative workplace which fosters creativity and innovation. With that, I'll turn the call over to Jean for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Yeah. Thanks, Toshiya. Great to hear from you. Yeah, so we're pleased with the results and execution in Q2. And -- I'm sorry, in Q1. And as you saw, we had a very strong quarter in datacenter, which I'll come back to in a minute. But just to kind of reframe from the demand side in all of our end markets, except consumer, we see very strong demand trends, Toshiya. Bookings have been very strong in the last two quarters. Demand -- our demand outlook for the year continues to be strong. And with respect to datacenter specifically, we did have a strong Q1 better than expected.  We still have pent-up demand and lack of supply there for the second quarter, but we expect actually a reacceleration in the datacenter in terms of our growth in Q3 and Q4, i.e., the second half. And on top of that, we have incremental new design wins that we've secured over the last 12 to 18 months, which we've sized roughly at, call it, $400 million incremental next year and $800 million the year after. That's actually going to start layering in as well in the second half.  So from our perspective, ex-consumer demand continues to be very strong. Datacenter in particular is going to have a great first half and a great second half. And then relative to supply, we really, first of all, credit to our operations team doing a great job in the first quarter, navigating all of the different impacts going on, in particular, in China and delivering a strong quarter. Looking forward, we're starting to see the benefit of all the investment we put in over the last year into our supply chain. Whether that be the improvement in systems and tools, the relationships and the capacity that we've secured, and so we believe that, that's going to continue. And we do see a much improved supply outlook not only in the short term as you can see from our results both beating in our Q1 and then guiding strongly for Q2, but also in the second half, Toshiya. And again, I think that's the result of a lot of hard work and transformation in our supply chain to meet our growth plans.  So, in summary, we have very strong demand driven by datacenter but also in 5G and automotive and the other things we've talked about and we've seen real improvements in our visibility into the supply we're going to get to go meet that customer demand. Yep. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Yeah, this was definitely a quarter where the mix wasn't exactly where we thought it was going to be from when we guided. As you could see, we overachieved in datacenter and we underachieved on enterprise. But as I pointed out in my comments, the delinquency and kind of the unfulfilled backlog relative to the size of the business is actually still the highest in enterprise.  So this was really a case of just us being unable to execute our supply plan for the quarter nothing to do with demand. In fact, the demand from our enterprise customers continues to be very robust looking into the second quarter and throughout the year. So it was nothing to do with them. They want more of our product, and you can see somewhat of a catch-up in Q2 with a very strong guide sequentially into the second quarter. But we see that continuing, Chris. So, I know there's been a lot of noise out there around enterprise, but from our perspective and talking to our customers, demand remains very strong. And in fact, we're behind in terms of our supply to catch up. But I think consistent with what Toshi was asking, we are looking to improve that in the second quarter and also through the second half. Yep. Yeah. Excellent question. And I think there's probably a piece of all of that. I think when I look back over what we've accomplished, one is we had to do a fairly significant education process across the supply chain of Marvell's prospects, how all the different pieces have come together from the different M&A we've done, our end market focus, et cetera. And so I think we did a good job of that of getting the broader supply chain ecosystem to understand the Marvell opportunity. And so, to a large extent, they're betting on us and they're supporting our growth.  And you can see that, right, just in terms of the year-over-year growth we're achieving, which by the way is off of a pretty strong year we had last year. So that's clearly a factor. We have also signed agreements relative to securing capacity. And you can see some of those that have shown up in our Q or 8-Ks we've issued partnerships we've entered into. So some of that has been down payments and supply agreements to ensure that we have the right capacity. I think that's some part of it.  And then it's hard to say, but on the last part of it, the sort of fungibility that may be coming into play a little bit, but it's too early to say. And quite frankly, the supply we're seeing today is we can really mostly attribute that to sort of our own effort. I will say, and just to be very clear for everybody on the call, we're not out of the woods here. Our unfulfilled backlog has continued to grow each quarter. We're definitely working that down. We're focused very much on the end demand and shipping to the right people. And we feel like we've done a good job of that in terms of keeping our customers' lines moving and not causing impacts and being very agile. But I think to the extent that on that third point, the fungibility side, if there were to be a true reduction or capitulation, let's call it, the PC and consumer end market and not needing all the supply they've consumed, that certainly could be an incremental thing we could look at in the second half. But that -- that's not quite there yet, but maybe some of it is. We do see pockets of things opening up, but it's really hard when you sort of drill into it where it exactly came from. Hope that's helpful. Kind of a combination that you sort of nailed it comes of the mid. Sure, Tim. Yeah. No, it's not unlike other cycles, where certainly the phenomena you point out, and this is the investor concern, right, more broadly in semis is have customers over-indexed on their order placements. And what happens when demand stops or slows down. So we've taken this very seriously.  I mean I just did a pretty much half a day review in the last few weeks with my entire team going through each of our product lines, going through to the customers and really kind of working through at an individual level where we still see the demand? Do we see any inventory building up? If so, what does it look like in that type of an exercise? And what I can tell you is there's no real examples I could point to, Tim, or anything thematic. I guess in some ways, we may have the benefit that we've been somewhat behind although I think we've done a good job of keeping everybody's lines moving. But certainly, we haven't been the company that's been swimming in capacity. So I think as we look out now, especially where the kind of global economy is beginning to moderate. We're able to kind of take a look now and do a refresh, especially with our improved supply situation and really make sure we're allocating it to the right people.  So it's a very active process, Tim, but I can't give you any nuggets of specific examples where I think thematically inventory may be building. But I guess I would conclude by saying we did -- we were pretty transparent in the prepared remarks about what we saw in the consumer segment, which albeit it's 12% of the business. And of that, a smaller portion of it is really exposed to what I would call kind of true consumer like PCs and things like that, but that did very much slow down. There definitely was a change in demand. And as a result, some supply that had there some inventory that had built up but we've got other moving pieces even with consumer that's sort of offsetting it. So a long way of answering it. I don't have any great examples, but we're on it. We're watching it. But I'd say the bulk of the meeting, to be honest, when I had it was the demand signals being very strong, right, across the cloud companies across our 5G business, enterprise wired. There's a lot of great opportunities for us. And a lot of this, Tim, is driven on Marvell's product cycles. It's not necessarily an end market phenomena we're dealing with here. It's really the new product ramps that you're very aware of across these different segments, and those seem very much intact in aggregate. Yeah. Great. Thanks, Vivek. Yes. On the first question, again, we're -- as you know, based on the timing of our reporting, we're like everybody else who's going right now. We had the month of April to comprehend in there relative to the China lockdown. And we navigated it really well. I think one of the reasons for us is that when COVID first happened, when the pandemic first began and there was major lockdowns everywhere China, including and also Southeast Asia, our operations team did a really good job of building up supply chain redundancy and resiliency over the last two years.  So effectively dual sourced almost everything we can coming in and out of China and even some of the other regions over there. So there was some impact. There was a little bit of product revenue where could we have gotten supply out of China, we could have fulfilled it, but it was very small, Vivek, to be honest with you. So we're able to be fairly agile in terms of moving things around.  So that was a positive. On the war in Ukraine and the impact on kind of in the again, I think you're hearing the data points, right? We don't see it directly, but certainly on the slowdown in the consumer segment, people's budgets being pinched, things like that. I think that's part of the issue with some of the consumer end market commentary. Again, we're not really in there. And we don't have operations in Ukraine or Russia. So we didn't really have any impact on that. So I think we're okay there. On the commentary on rising inventory, look, I'm very aware of this. You can pull everybody's Qs out and look at -- and one simple thing we do is look and OEM companies' inventory growth. And you can see across a wide range of companies and industries, growth in inventory far exceeding revenue growth. So that is something we're paying attention to. We're using that to dive in deep with our customers. But I would say that our view tends to be like a lot of our customers, which is the end demand, especially in enterprise, in cloud and in our product cycle in 5G, the demand looks pretty strong. But there is -- there are missing pieces. There is the golden screw issue for sure that some of our customers have. We're just trying not to be the golden screw and also be very kind of clear eyed about where the inventory is and what does that mean for Marvell. And so I can tell you is we're digging into it at a part level detail and making sure that we're being prudent about where we allocate the supply. But it is something we got to keep watching for sure. Yeah. Vivek, just to chime in on Jean's comments, I fully agree. If you look at just the steepness of the revenue ramp we're dealing with. Clearly, the WIP has to go up, right, just to sort of support the growth. So that part we're comfortable with. And given the given the lockdowns and all the volatility, I think having that extra inventory carry for us is very prudent. And we watch it, and we'll certainly work it down. But I don't think you're going to see many companies go back to the good old days of 80 days or something like that, unless they truly get into trouble. I just think for a while, we're all going to have to be mindful that there's a lot of volatility in the world. But we're sort of in the range now, and we're very conscious in terms of what we're doing here. Hey, Matt. Good to hear from you, and good questions. Yes, I think you did nail it on one of the more important aspects of the upcoming CPU cycles is the IO, right, and the release of PCIe Gen 5 and we've certainly been preparing for that. That is a key part of the equation for us, particularly, as you can imagine, in our storage business and our datacenter storage business, which One of the key things we have to align to on our product roadmap is obviously nailing the PCIe IO road map, and it's not a trivial thing, not only the controller, but obviously the PHY and getting everything qualified and working. And so our team has done a great job there. We're very well positioned in storage on PCIe Gen 5 actually said in my remarks, we've already got wins lined up on Gen 6. That's still a ways out, but that's going to be another leg of growth. And you're right, the PCIe standard is really going to be the fabric and the interconnect that CXL runs on top of. And so a lot of the effort we put in on both Gen 5 and in the future, Gen 6 is going to give us tremendous leverage as we think about disaggregation, particularly of memory and these different solutions that are going to emerge around CXL. So it's very strategic. We do -- we always make make-or-buy decisions on things in terms of make versus buy, sorry, on technologies, but this is one, particularly on the PHY layer for PCIe that we've -- we do ourselves, and we have -- we're best-in-class in what we do here, and then we leverage that into our larger SOCs. So -- but I think the biggest impact from Marvell will be just driving broader adoption of our data center flash controllers, which again, are well positioned across a number of NAND OEMs. And products defined directly with the cloud OEMs going back several years, right, to get all this lined up. So it's going to be a good cycle for us. And then sorry, on cloud CapEx, I don't have any insight. I -- we certainly look at all the publicly available data. The most recent update certainly looked promising. But I would say for Marvell, Matt, and for the rest of the investors on the call, we're -- of course, the overall CapEx environment in cloud can certainly be a tailwind and that could be a headwind for anybody that supplies into there. But -- you got to remember, most of our revenue coming from the cloud is really in new product cycles that are very Marvell-specific in some cases. I mean, let's take let's take PAM, for example. If you went back a year ago, you really had a couple of companies deploying it versus older NRZ-based solutions. You head into this year, there are now additional companies as well that are going to be driving that cycle on 200 and 400-gig. We have new applications like even 800-gig as an example, for AI clusters and things like that where we started ramping our 800-gig product.  So whether the CapEx goes up or down, there's new applications and new replacement cycles that are going on. And then there's just other things like, for example, in our Cloud Ethernet switch area, right? There was new wins we got through the Innovium team that joined us last year. We expect continued strong growth from that product area. We have new cloud optimized silicon in ASICs and DPUs that were designed in over the last couple of years. Those are going to be ramping up. So we are very -- we're paying attention to it, Matt, but I would say that that it's a little bit like our 5G business. You can see things go up and down and lumpiness in the market. But when you have a strong product cycle with either content or share gain and new customers coming on, you can power through and that's our full expectation in the cloud. We have very strong conviction on our business there today, particularly in the second half and next year relative to the cloud hyperscale and we'll watch the CapEx trend, but most of our products are independent of that trend. Yeah. Sure, Tore. Yeah, Gen 6, as it relates to storage, you're absolutely right. Given the increase in IO throughput and data rate, you had to move to a PAM-based architecture. So that's played right into our strengths. We've coupled that with our -- and we were early to do this, by the way, with our 5-nanometer technology platform. And so there's just a whole lot of goodness and reuse there, as you can imagine. And it really put us in a strong position to get there early, and I give our storage business unit, a lot of credit for really having thought leadership here. I mean they probably jumped like two nodes on everybody, not that it's a whole node game, but in terms of just the power and the performance that we're getting out of these solutions. And then, of course, the benefit we get to take the IO down to 5-nanometer and leveraging PAM is actually a huge help, right, just given the given the complexity. And you saw that in our optical business, right, and kind of how Inphi drove performance over time as they've driven PAM on new process node, same thing over here. So I think that's going to be very strategic. And yeah, I think that that platform now -- again, we're early, right? We're just talking about launch today, but we do like to give color on our future leaning roadmap. But it definitely plays to our strengths. And I think as you think about also what's going to be required in CXL. I think even things like closing the link and the need for retimers and re-drivers, accelerators, pooling applications, they're all going to require robust Gen 6 IP and then be able to integrate those into various different SoCs. And I would just say even today, the CXL activity we're seeing in terms of our design opportunities is pretty broad, and it's almost all -- it really is all in our 5-nanometer platform.  So it all kind of hangs together, Tore, and maybe I think you sort of see this, but I think others are as well. The combination of all the IPs that we brought together through the different acquisitions plus the Marvell technology platform has really created an opportunity for us to go-to-market with these semi-custom solutions and be very successful in this next wave of cloud optimized silicon. Yeah. Thanks, Harlan, for the question. And maybe just to start at the top on coherent DSP. I'm not sure everybody quite understood. Even the Inphi people that followed Inphi closely, how strategic this technology is. A little bit of background. They had had their own effort in coherent Inphi, and they ended up acquiring a company called ClariPhy a few years before we acquired Inphi. And ultimately, they chose to ClariPhy coherent DSP road map. This is very, very difficult stuff to do, Harlan. And once you get it right and get it designed in, these are very, very long product life cycles, particularly in the metro long-haul type of markets, the telco type markets. And that's really what's driving -- that's really where the revenue is showing up today for this. The added benefit is obviously the same technology and chips are used in the ZR 400 the ZR market as well for DCI. So there's a double benefit here. And so on the merchant side, we're a strong leader. We have a road map, obviously, beyond this to 800-gig. That's going to play in well to our next-generation DCI products as well. And then even longer term, there's discussions longer term about the modulation technology eventually inside datacenter moving to coherent. So it's a very strategic technology for Marvell.  And to answer your question on the ZR DCI side, we -- and I said it in my prepared remarks that it might have begun lost, but we do have multiple customers for this, not just one. And those will be ramping up over the next year or so, the additional customers. We're already shipping and putting out record results on the DCI products as it is. We're really driven by one customer, but there's more coming.  So we're pretty excited about this. And we have a whole ecosystem lined up, right? We have a number of module partners for different applications. And so -- anyway, yes, it's something we'll be talking about more. Maybe we'll do a tech talk on that one, too, Harlan, but it's actually a really important technology that we got from Inphi. And it's obviously an outstanding team that really feeds a lot of the other things that we do inside the company. Yeah. And just 1 final thing, I would say, remember, too, this is a chip set as well. So it's not just the DSP, it's the driver, it's the TIA and there's even other components we're looking at to really optimize the solution. So when you hang all that together and you can deliver it as a platform. It's very powerful. Welcome. I'll just add, C.J. I totally agree with Jean, obviously. And just to remind everybody, we set a range of -- on gross margins as our target model of 64% to 66%. We had a record 65.3% in Q4. Then we had another record of 65.5% in Q1, and then we're guiding 65.25% if you look at the midpoint in Q2. So it's kind of in in the range, if you know what I mean, I think run the company around that 65-ish is a really good place to be. If we can continue to grow the company the way we're growing it and drive leverage and drive design wins and stay competitive. So I think it's -- I think we're in pretty good shape. I think obviously reasonable to ask the question, but I think, as Jean said, we're going to have little movements here and there on mix. And we're ultimately just focused on keeping it in the right range in the right strike zone and then just driving really strong top-line growth and driving operating leverage through the cycle we're in here."

            "name": "Jean Hu",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. I'll start with a review of our financial results for the first quarter and then provide our current outlook for the second quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.447 billion, exceeding the middle point of our guidance, growing 8% sequentially and 74% year-over-year. Datacenter was our largest end market driving 44% of consolidated revenue. Enterprise networking was next largest to be 20% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 18%. Consumer added 12% and the auto industrial at 6%. GAAP gross margin was 51.9%. Non-GAAP gross profit was $947 million or 65.5% of revenue, another record driven by rich product mix. GAAP operating expenses were $681 million and include the cost of share-based compensation expenses. Amortization of acquired intangible assets, legal segment and acquisition and divestiture-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $435 million reflecting the increase in R&D headcount and project expenses to execute design wins across all our data infrastructure end market. As we outlined at our Investor Day last year, we plan to continue to invest in R&D, given the tremendous opportunities we have in front of us, while keeping OpEx growth well below top line revenue growth to drive to our long-term target model. GAAP operating income was $70 million, we achieved record non-GAAP operating profit of $512 million, up 123% from a year ago, and our non-GAAP operating margin was 35.4%. During the first quarter, our GAAP income tax expense was $205 million. This included the impact from a onetime non-cash tax charge of $240 million offset by other tax benefits in the quarter. The $240 million non-cash tax charge was due to the measurement of our net deferred tax asset as a result for obtaining and expansion of a lower foreign restriction tax incentives. For the first quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.20. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.52, up 79% year-over-year, exceeding the middle point of our guidance.  Now turning to our balance sheet and cash flow. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $195 million as we increased our working capital investment to support the top line revenue growth in a very tight supply chain environment. The increase in working capital was primarily driven by increase in inventory, especially raw materials and work in progress help us manage it through ongoing supply chain disruption. We also made $86 million in payments during the quarter to secure long-term capacity with our suppliers.  As of the end of the first fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $465 million, and our long-term debt was $4.5 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.3 times, and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2 times. We returned $66 million to million in cash dividends and $15 million to share repurchase during the first quarter. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2023 over the first three weeks of the second quarter, we repurchased additional $50 million of our shares through our 10b-5 program. We are pleased that we have restarted the share repurchase program as we believe it's in the best interest of the company and our long-term shareholders.  In summary, the Marvell team executed exceptionally well delivering accelerated top-line revenue growth and strong earnings expansion significantly faster than revenue growth.  Turning to our guidance. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, we expect the following results: revenue in the range of $1.515 billion plus or minus 3%. GAAP gross margin in the range of 49.6% to 51.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin in the range of 65% to 65.5%. GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $669 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $435 million, which assumes that we will complete the acquisition of in the second quarter.  For the second quarter, we expect non-GAAP tax rate of 6%. We expect our basic weighted average share outstanding will be 853 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 862 million. As a result, we expect GAAP earnings per share in the range of $0.02 to $0.10. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.53 to $0.59.  Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. Yeah. And to add to what Matt said is we actually chose to increase our inventory to support the revenue growth in the second half. We have a very broad set of product lines, and we see strong demand. So the flexibility we need to have raw materials and the way to support the revenue growth is really critical. So we did choose that to make sure we can support the customers and the future revenue growth. The current level is what we are comfortable. We think we can help and manage the supplies for the second half. I think if the environment is normalized, we definitely will have a lower inventory like 120 days. That's what we think we should keep. But right now, we definitely chose to increase it to provide more flexibility. Yeah. Ross, thanks for the question. I think our team has been very disciplined to manage OpEx to make sure we follow our overall business model right, grow revenue significantly faster than OpEx growth and keep the gross margin right in the middle or even above the middle of our long-term target model, so we can drive the earnings expansion much faster than top line revenue growth.  When you look at the OpEx in Q1, as I said earlier, we increased headcount and project expense to really execute on all the design wins we have won. Q2, it's we keep it flat. In the second half, it's going to go a little bit higher, slightly higher, but it's largely because we are going to grow revenue in second half to support the revenue growth, you have certain variable expenses that will increase slightly in second half. In the longer term, you should continue to expect us to drive top-line revenue growth and OpEx around 50% slower than top line revenue growth. So we can continue to get the earnings expansion.  So in Q2, if you look at the midpoint of our guide, our operating margin is already above 36%. We are very, very driven to get our operating model to the 38% to 40% range. Yeah. So CJ, thanks for the question. First, on the net leverage, if you look at our Q2 guidance at the middle point of our guidance our net leverage ratio will be below 2, gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio will be around 2, but the net leverage will be below 2. As I said earlier, we have restarted share repurchase program even after end of Q1, subsequently, we did purchase additional $50 million through our 10b-5 program.  So our capital allocation principle is still the same, right? We want to invest, but we are also committed to return more than 50% free cash flow to shareholders, primarily through share repurchase. On the gross margin, our gross margin, we are very pleased with the Q1 gross margin, which is a record in the Q2 guide it's all both above middle point for our long-term target. So the Q2 is really just a mix. We have so many different product lines quarter-over-quarter, you will see the mix change up and down of our middle point I would not predict that closely. But in general, it should be around 65% sometimes higher."

All participants will be in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's Chairman and CEO; and Willem Maintjes, our CFO. Let me remind everyone that certain comments made today include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Earlier today, we announced our accelerated infrastructure for the AI ERA Investor event, which will be held in New York on April 11. Please refer to our press release for more details. We look forward to updating investors on the exciting opportunities we see in front of us from the growth in accelerated infrastructure. Let me now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the quarter. Matt?\nMatt Murphy : Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, Marvell delivered revenue of $1.43 billion, growing 1% sequentially above the midpoint of guidance. In addition, on a non-GAAP basis, the Marvell team drove a substantial 330 basis point sequential increase in gross margin, completed execution on the OpEx reduction plan we outlined earlier in the year and delivered earnings per share of $0.46, growing 12% sequentially. As Willem will tell you in greater detail, we also drove another strong quarter of operating cash and increased share repurchases. We are pleased to report these results to you and remains a challenging macro environment. In our data center end market for the fourth quarter, we drove record revenue of $765 million, above our guidance, growing 54% year-over-year and 38% sequentially. The strong revenue growth in the quarter was driven by the cloud portion of our data center end markets. While AI has been a key growth driver, I am pleased that our standard cloud infrastructure revenue has also grown every quarter, and we see that continuing next year. Our 800-gig PAM solutions led our growth in the fourth quarter. We also benefited from higher sequential demand for our storage products as that portion of our data center end market continues its recovery. Revenue from our Teralynx Ethernet switches also grew sequentially in the quarter. Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We expect our overall data center revenue to grow in the low single-digits sequentially on a percentage basis. We expect revenue from both AI and standard cloud data centers to continue to grow sequentially. We project our electro-optics revenue to continue to be strong, and we also expect to benefit from the initial shipments of our cloud optimized AI silicon programs. Partially offsetting this growth, we are projecting a more than seasonal sequential decline in revenue from enterprise on-premise data centers. Over the past several years, Marvell has strategically invested in technology, both organically and through acquisitions to become a critical enabler of accelerated infrastructure. The seismic shift driven by AI in the data center market is creating new opportunities, and we are actively investing to lead the next wave of innovation. We have in place a full suite of solutions across data center interconnect, switching and compute, and the ability to uniquely stitch these together into a unified platform, a true one-stop shop for our data center customers. While our 100-gig per lane 800-gig PAM products are currently the workhorse for interconnect inside AI data centers, customers have begun qualifying our next-generation 200-gig per Lane 1.6T PAM solutions. We expect first deployments to start towards the end of this year. Complementing our optical interconnect solutions, we expect to start ramping our PAM DSPs for active electrical cables. This is a new and completely additive market for Marvell and we expect to be shipping products to multiple Tier 1 cloud customers this year. Our DCI products, which provide connectivity between data centers are critical to our customers' success and continue to do very well. We see exciting new opportunities ahead of us from growth in generative AI applications, driving cloud customers to build new data centers. We also expect a positive uplift from increased investment in inferencing, which will drive more bandwidth between data centers. We are shipping our 400-gig DCI products in high volume today and are seeing strong interest for our next-generation 800-gig products. I'm also very pleased to report to you that in fiscal 2024, we significantly expanded our DCI customer base with design wins at multiple data center customers. We expect these design wins to begin ramping next year. As you will remember from prior calls, Marvell silicon photonics technology has been a critical enabler of our DCI modules. You will hear more at OFC and our upcoming AI event about how we plan to deploy our field-proven silicon photonics technology to enable next-generation higher density, lower power interconnects. In data center switching, our Teralynx 12.8T products continue to ship in high volume and we are on track for production shipments of our next-generation 51.2T switch later this year. The Teralynx product line, you will recall, came from our Innovium acquisition. Combine the Innovium team with Marvell's very successful enterprise and carrier switching organization. This larger scale now enables Marvell to accelerate our development to address new cloud opportunities, particularly in switching for AI deployments. We are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with both existing and new customers, which has expanded our opportunity funnel for cloud switching dramatically over the past year. Turning to our cloud optimized silicon platform. We're seeing significant progress with the first set of design wins outlined during our last Investor Day. We expect initial shipments for our two AI compute programs to start in the first quarter and are on track for a very substantial ramp in the second half of the fiscal year. Customer bring up of these programs is going extremely well, and we are tightly aligned with them on volume expectations and working in lockstep to enable the production. We now have a clear view of demand for both this fiscal year as well as fiscal 2026. We have been working closely with our suppliers and are confident that we have secured capacity for the ramp. With the visibility we now have for these programs, along with many new opportunities, we are very excited about the potential scale of long-term revenue for Marvell from this business. As the initial set of design wins reach its full run rate, we expect annual revenue from cloud optimized silicon has the potential to rival our fast-growing data center optics business, which, for reference, grew to over $1 billion in fiscal 2024. With the exploding investment in AI and accelerated computing, the demand for cloud optimized silicon has grown significantly. We have successfully executed multiple 5-nanometer designs in the last two years and are deeply engaged with cloud customers on many new 3-nanometer opportunities. These engagements are driving a substantial increase in the size of our design funnel. AI is increasing the cadence of new chip releases and this plays well to Marvell's strength as a key partner for our cloud customers with a proven ASIC platform. We have a broad suite of differentiated IP, including ultra high-speed SerDes, armed compute, security, storage and advanced packaging, including die-to-die interconnects and chiplets. We are well positioned to act as a force multiplier for our cloud customers, enabling them to scale multiple custom programs in quick succession. Now let me turn to Marvell's carrier and enterprise end markets together. As we have been communicating, these end markets have been dealing with a period of soft industry demand. As a result, both were down sequentially in the fourth quarter and we expect them to decline again in the first quarter. On a sequential basis, we expect revenue in the first quarter from carrier to decline by approximately 50% and enterprise networking to decline by approximately 40%. Looking ahead, we expect revenue declines in these end markets to be behind us after the first quarter and forecast a recovery in the second half of the fiscal year. Longer term, these are large and enduring end markets, which are critical to the global economy. As a result, we expect both of these end markets to eventually return to contributing over $1 billion each in revenue on an annual basis once demand normalizes, and we begin to realize the benefits of upcoming Marvell-specific product cycles. Turning to the consumer end market. Revenue declined in the fourth quarter as expected and is projected to decline approximately 70% sequentially in the first quarter. This forecast reflects the completion of deliveries for an end-of-life program in the prior quarter as well as significantly weaker demand from the game console market. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $82 million, declining 17% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. As expected, the sequential weakness was primarily driven by a sharp decline in the industrial portion of this end market, where order patterns can be lumpy in any given quarter. Fiscal 2024, our automotive business delivered another strong year, with revenue growing in the double-digits year-over-year on a percentage basis. We are benefiting from growth in Marvell content driven by an increase in the number of Ethernet connected endpoints in cars, coupled with the need for more bandwidth. We've continued to accumulate new Ethernet design wins across a broad swath of automotive OEMs. While the initial wave of our automotive revenue was driven primarily by EVs and hybrids, we now have also on high-volume internal combustion vehicles with major auto OEMs. These wins tend to be multi-platform in nature, covering numerous models simultaneously. Turning now to our forecast for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenue from our overall auto and industrial end market to be flat sequentially. In summary, in fiscal 2024, we delivered total revenue of $5.5 billion. Our data center revenue accelerated throughout the year, growing from about a third of total company revenue in the first quarter to more than half exiting the fourth quarter. As customers continue to shift investment from traditional to accelerated infrastructure, we expect data center to drive the majority of our revenue growth going forward. This transition underscores Marvell's transformation into a leading data center company. AI was a key driver of our data center growth in fiscal 2024, contributing over 10% of total company revenue, well above our initial forecast. This was a substantial increase from approximately 3% in the prior year. Our momentum accelerated throughout the fiscal year with AI revenue well over $200 million in the fourth quarter, driven mostly from Optics. In fiscal 2025, we expect this trend to continue driving another strong year for our data center end market. We expect a substantial base of electro-optics revenue from AI should remain correlated to accelerator shipments. And as those continue to grow, we expect to benefit accordingly. In addition, we project significant revenue contributions from our AI cloud optimized programs, well in excess of our prior estimate of a couple of hundred million dollars in fiscal 2025. In fact, as our cloud optimized AI silicon programs reach high-volume production, we expect our overall cloud optimized revenue to exceed $200 million exiting the fourth quarter. As a result, on a run rate basis, this momentum would put our overall cloud optimized silicon revenue above the annual $800 million target we had provided at our last Investor Day. And with the full year of contributions in fiscal 2026, we expect to be way ahead of the prior target. In aggregate, we see a favorable setup for the second half of this fiscal year, driven by continued growth from our data center end market, ongoing growth from automotive, and a recovery in carrier, enterprise and consumer. As we continue to drive revenue growth, we remain focused on strong cash flow generation and returning capital to investors. As you saw earlier today, Marvell's Board has approved the largest repurchase authorization in our history. We view the emergence of accelerated infrastructure as one of the most significant technology inflections of our time. I thank all our dedicated employees and leaders for executing on our strategy to fully capitalize on this remarkable opportunity. During a tumultuous period for the semiconductor industry, we have taken control of our destiny and are strategically investing to win. Earlier today, we announced the extension of our long-standing collaboration with TSMC to develop the industry's first technology platform to produce 2-nanometer semiconductors optimized for accelerated infrastructure. This new platform will enable Marvell to deliver substantial advancements in performance, power and area critical for next-generation accelerated workloads. We are very optimistic about our growth prospects and our role in enabling accelerated infrastructure. We look forward to updating investors on the massive opportunity in front of us at our accelerated infrastructure for the AI ERA event on April 11 in New York City. With that, I'll turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nWillem Meintjes: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our fiscal year 2024 results. Marvell delivered $5.5 billion in revenue with a strong second half performance from our data center end market. Driven by AI applications, our data center revenue in the second half grew by approximately 50% over the first half. GAAP gross margin was 41.6%, GAAP operating margin was negative 10.3% and GAAP loss per diluted share was $1.08. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. And our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.51. We returned $357 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Moving on to our financial results for the fourth quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.427 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, growing 1% on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Data center was our largest end market, driving 54% of total revenue. The next largest was enterprise networking with 19%, followed by carrier infrastructure at 12%, consumer at 10% and auto industrial at 5%. GAAP gross margin was 46.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.9%, growing 330 basis points sequentially, driven by a significantly better product mix as we had expected. Moving on to operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses were $697 million, including stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $429 million, in line with our guidance. These results reflect the successful completion of our fiscal 2024 cost reduction plan we had outlined at the beginning of the year. GAAP operating margin was negative 2.3%, while non-GAAP operating margin was 33.8%. For the fourth quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.45, non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.46, growing 12% sequentially. Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $547 million. I'm pleased to report to you our second straight quarter, delivering robust operating cash flow of over $500 million. Our inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $864 million, decreasing by $77 million from the prior quarter. Our DSO was 77 days, decreasing by a day from the prior quarter. We returned $52 million to shareholders through cash dividends. In addition, we repurchased $100 million of our stock during the fourth quarter, doubling from the prior quarter. We expect to further increase repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. As you saw earlier today, Marvel's Board has approved the largest repurchase authorization in our history, increasing our current plan by $3 billion, which brings our total available authorization to $3.3 billion. Our total debt was $4.17 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.19x and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.69x. As of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $951 million, increasing by $225 million from the prior quarter. Turning to our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.15 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 44.5% to 47.2%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 63%. We are forecasting a sequential decrease in non-GAAP gross margin due to lower revenue impacting fixed cost absorption. Looking forward, we expect that the overall level of revenue and product mix will remain key determinants of our gross margin in any given quarter. For the first quarter, we project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $676 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $455 million. This forecast includes a step-up from the prior quarter due to typical seasonality in payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases. For the first quarter, we expect other income and expense including interest on our debt to be approximately $48 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate of 7% for the first quarter. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding to be $866 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be $875 million. We anticipate GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of a loss of $0.18 to a loss of $0.28. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.18 to $0.28. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.\nRoss Seymore: Clearly, it's kind of a tale of two cities, the data center and AI side is going to be really strong, the rest of it not so much. So why don't we just get the bad news out of the way first. The magnitude of the drops ex your data center are kind of shocking. Can you just walk us through how much of that is something that is not going to come back, some of the stuff in 5G, et cetera, versus what do you view as just taking the cyclical medicine and then a snapback should it ensue soon thereafter?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, definitely a tale of two cities. On the carrier enterprise and consumer side, the way to think about it is, sure, the drops are pretty steep in Q4 and Q1. We're definitely going through a cyclical downturn in the industry, you've been doing this a long time, so have I, we've seen that happen, and that's what we're going through. The way to think about both of those businesses is at their peak, together, they were about $2.5 billion in revenue, and this would sort of be during the pandemic and some of the supply chain issues that went on. You can now see we're shipping well below that. And so I said in my prepared remarks, both of these are very solid businesses, Ross, for Marvell. Both will recover to greater than $1 billion in revenue, over time, the question is when. And remember as well, within these businesses, these are very long product life cycles, typically like seven years in production. So these are designs. In some cases, we won 3 or 4, 5 years ago, some of them we just won a year or two ago. So we feel good about these businesses, but they are going through some demand softness and some inventory correction, but we expect to see that behind us. And to be very specific, none of this is due to any business that's not \u201ccoming back or share loss\u201d. And in fact, when things recover back to a normalized run rate, we do have Marvell product growth drivers in both of those segments, carrier and enterprise to drive growth going forward. So we're just managing through it in the short term.\nOperator: The next question will come from Matt Ramsey with TD Cowen.\nMatt Ramsay: I guess kind of a two-part question on the custom silicon business. The first part of it, Matt, you gave us some good color in your script as to how you see $200 million exiting the year and exceeding the $800 million for next. You kind of referenced the billion dollars at scale. And I just wonder if you could maybe square the rest of that, circle with that just for business you've won today for fiscal '26 or is there more to come? And I guess the second part of the question, my observation is you guys probably have, A, more shots on goal for custom silicon, and B, each one of the shots on goal could be potentially a very large or larger than expected piece of business given what's happening in the AI trend. But I guess my concern is as you evaluate those opportunities when those programs will be shipping 2, 3, 4 years in advance and trying to figure out how those programs would sort of align with the dominant player in the space's road map 2 or 3 years out and the pace of that innovation. Like how do you guys evaluate the potential for the size of the business when lots of shots on goal, but the probability of each of those shots ongoing being successful might be hard to gauge given how quickly the industry is moving. Hopefully, that makes sense. I'm just trying to get an idea of how you're scaling the business and taking on orders given all the volatility and rapid technology advancements in this space.\nMatt Murphy: Okay. Let me just tackle them both. On the first one, yes, super excited about the ramp we're seeing now on the custom silicon programs we won a couple of years back. So we're shipping in Q1 on both programs. It's fantastic. We gave some color in the prepared remarks on the exit rate being $200 million plus. I don't want to cap that at this point, but certainly, that's sort of the way to think about it as the floor, and then we go from there. So that would imply, obviously, in fiscal '26, a much larger number than the $800 million we had called out. And again, I think it's still dynamic and still early but we're very excited from the bullish forecast we're seeing from our customers. So '26 looks very strong from the programs that we've won, and we should be way ahead of the plan that we had articulated a ways back. On the second question, yes, I don't think I've ever seen more design win activity in my career as right now, in AI, custom silicon, networking, optics, you name it, this whole transformation that's going on and data center architectures is creating this massive opportunity for Marvell specifically on the custom portion of it. I mean, we're talking about a TAM creation that's going to be in the tens of billions of dollars range. And we'll talk more about that at our AI Day. But very significant sort of opportunity that's emerging in front of us. And that being said, I view that as very complementary to the merchant leader in this space. I think both have a place given the workloads that are required, given the scale of computing that's needed. And I don't think it's a zero-sum game. I've been saying this for a while. I think both segments, the merchant side as well as the custom side are going to grow to be very enormous TAMs. And so yes, we're right in the mix on all the major opportunities and programs. We have assembled an incredible team, an incredible portfolio of technology. We announced today our continued partnership with TSMC with a very full and robust roadmap of IP and technology to specifically address AI and accelerated computing applications for the next generation. So that's got a lot of excitement with the customers as well. So yes, overall, we're very bullish, and we think the whole -- all the boats are going to lift on this one and certainly for Marvell creates a huge new TAM opportunity that we really didn't have just a few years ago.\nOperator: The next question will come from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.\nChristopher Rolland: I guess, first of all, Matt, thanks for giving the custom ASIC opportunity numbers again. I think that means, probably means you guys have a pretty strong pipeline. But I would love to drill down on that a little bit more. So I guess, first of all, maybe you can talk about these opportunities, training versus inference, how you see that versus perhaps just compute? And then what's kind of the -- do you have a secret sauce that's landing these? Like your competitor has really used there at the time, leading edge SerDes IP as a driver of those wins. Is there something that you have some special sauce that are winning these?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, hopefully, some of the custom numbers were helpful. Investors last year and this year, there was a lot of interest in sort of what the size of that was. And now that we've got the visibility, it's great to start articulating where we think that is. I think on your second sort of piece of your question around training versus inference and compute. At this point, I would just put it in a very large bucket of what I'm calling decabillions [ph] in TAM creation. I don't know that we're -- I'm on this call certainly prepared to slice it out. And I don't even think we know where this is going to be in three to five years relative to that exact split. But I would say the opportunity set for us crosses all of those applications, okay? And then relative to where we are in terms of our technology, our competitiveness, I mean it's pretty astonishing if you think about it. When we won the designs we won, Chris, at 5-nanometer, that was really our first time as Marvell to compete in this segment, especially in the data center. The origins of this business go back to our purchase of Avera in 2019. We pivoted that roadmap during dependency of the close and right after from 14-nanometer technology all the way to 5-nanometer and even though it was our first time out, SerDes was competitive, packaging technology, interconnect, manufacturing scale, strategic partnerships up and down the supply chain, and that enabled us to win a significant share of ASICs in business, which is now coming to fruition here in fiscal '25 and '26. We followed that up with our 3-nanometer platform, which has now been a big part of the opportunity set in the funnel we're competing in today. We are in a completely different position now relative to 5-nanometer because we had the learnings, we had the readiness. And now we're really leaning in, okay, in terms of being a first mindset around not just nanometers, but die-to-die interconnect, packaging, SerDes technology, optics and really in chiplets and think about how to stitch all this together. And on top of that, with the scale of Marvell and our strategic partnerships, we really look to our customers like an incredibly solid, trustworthy long-term partner for their needs to really help them realize their AI silicon ambitions. So that\u2019s where we are today. I mean we did great on 5-nanometer, we\u2019re going to do great on 3-nanometer, and we\u2019re going to do great in the future. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question will come from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company.\nQuinn Bolton: I'm going to follow-up on the cloud ASIC question as well. But I guess I'm coming at it from a margin perspective. Matt, you look at some of these programs on the cloud compute side to the extent that they integrate high-bandwidth memory. It certainly does nice things to the ASP, but there's also a pretty significant costs that you may have to pass through. And so I'm wondering, can you talk about the gross margins on some of these ASIC platforms, how does that compare to the corporate average? And as you ramp, especially if cloud ASICs get to be similar in size to the optics, which I know are good margins, how do you see the margin mix changing with this now very, very strong ramp of cloud ASIC programs? And then I've got a quick follow-up, if I can sneak it in.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes. I mean on the way we've talked about that business, actually since Avera in 2019 is that it would always due to the nature of custom business be at a lower gross margin overall than the company average and the target. At the same time, because of the NRE and non-recurring engineering that we receive as part of the customer funding of these programs, the operating margins of this business tend to be very competitive and over time, in line with our company targets. When you start talking about these very, very large programs, you've got opportunity given the volume and scale on the OM line to really drive a lot of leverage in the model. But the GMs, just due to the nature of that business model will always be a little bit lower than the total. I would say, though, at the same time, because the sort of follow-on sometimes is we'll see if that happens and what happens to the overall company gross margin profile. And remember, we still have very strong gross margin merchant businesses in storage and in networking, automotive. Some of those were even under-shipping demand right now. So as the year plays out, some of those businesses will come back and that should be a little bit of a margin offset to some of the custom stuff. So we're still managing to our long-term target model. But yes, the cloud stuff, especially if these volumes certainly lower gross margin. You got a quick one for the second? We can do it, otherwise, we've got to [indiscernible].\nQuinn Bolton: Yes, quick one on the second. You mentioned sort of ramping AECs at multiple hyperscalers this year. Just wondering if you might be able to give us some sense. Is that meaningful? Any sense on the magnitude of that ramp?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. I think what I'd say is it's absolutely a real market. We felt that way for some time. Even back when we acquired Inphi, that was sort of a shot on goal we thought was possible. I think the big news is that we're qualifying at multiple hyperscalers now. We're starting to go into production this year. We'll get a very nice, solid kind of more full year-ish ramp in fiscal '26 but it's definitely an incremental additive category to Marvell. And it really leverages our high-speed or high-performance DSP and PAM technology, which is really now inflecting in this wave of AC before it was based on the older modulation techniques which where we didn't participate. So yes, really excited about it, but let it play out for a few more quarters.\nOperator: Your next question will come from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.\nHarsh Kumar: Matt. So AI is hot, there's no other way to put it. You are in kind of a pole position with your optical piece, Inphi piece. Can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the size of that business, either quarterly or last year? Anything you can provide us that helps us size it? And also kind of what kind of growth rate you expect to see from this business? And then, Matt, when you say the bottom is for some of the pieces like consumer and networking the bottom will be this 1Q time frame, what piece do you think will come off the bottom in 2Q? Or do you expect all the pieces to come off the bottom in 2Q?\nMatt Murphy: Okay. Let me do this. I'll take the first one, and I'll let Willem take the second one. So I can take a breather and he can you can also answer your question. Yes, on the first one, I think we gave some pretty good color. I mean, if you think about it, the Q4 exit rate on AI, right, was well north of $200 million. And the bulk of that, as we said, was in optics. So if you just -- and then you can start extrapolating well jeez, and you got to add in how much revenue is Marvell getting on the standard cloud side in optics, and that's another very nice chunk. And then you've got some of the stuff that we have that shows up on the carrier side, I'm talking about Inphi now, on the coherent DSPs. There's some ASICs that we have. So the overall Inphi business, if that's what you're asking, since we bought it has clearly outperformed the deal model and has just become an incredibly strategic asset for us, both in terms of just the technology we picked up, but the team, the synergy with the other portfolio, the other product lines we have, and so just super positive about that, and it looks like that whole opportunity is going to be much larger than I think we were in [indiscernible] just a few years back. Willem, do you want to take the second part of it?\nWillem Meintjes: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, so we're really working with customers to focus on Q1 being the bottom, really confident that, that's the bottom. And then we see growth resuming in the second half across enterprise networking, carrier and consumer. So really just trying to make sure that we put this behind us really quickly and see growth in the second half.\nOperator: The next question will come from Vivek Arya with Bank of America.\nVivek Arya: Matt, one more on electro-optics. I think near term, it seems in Q1, there's probably a little bit of a breather after several strong quarters. But the more important question is that should we assume that your electro-optics that is related to AI should grow somewhat proportional to the growth in accelerators? So for example, if you look at accelerator growth this year, I've seen various numbers between 50% to 100%, kind of year-on-year growth. So should the AI part of your electro-optics grow kind of commensurate with that? Or is there something different? And then when does 1.62, 1.16, 1.6T, sorry, when does that start to play a role in your electro-optics business?\nMatt Murphy: Well, I think it depends on how you -- the definition of breather you use. I mean, basically, it's ramped up just so significantly, right, the Electro-optics business Q2 to Q3, Q3 to Q4, and staying strong in Q1, maybe it's a breather from the sequential growth point of view, but we still have not seen that slow down. And then on the -- let's see, I got your second one. The third one was on 1.6T, I'll come back to your second one in a second. That is going to ramp later this year. That's gone really well. The quals and the product bring up. We announced at OFC last year and a lot of demand and interest. And then sorry, your second question on AI?\nVivek Arya: Yes. So should your electro-optics grow kind of proportional to the growth and accelerator. Yes.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Sorry, yes, the accelerator. For sure. The way we think about it is the -- that business year-over-year should grow in line with accelerator growth -- accelerator unit growth. We view it as very correlated. Obviously, there's some timing issues in terms of supply chain and things like that. But that's a simple way to think about it, and everyone's got a little bit of a different model at this point about what that number is, but our view is we're highly correlated to accelerator shipments, in our optics business.\nOperator: The next question will come from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.\nGary Mobley: As a way to think about the win or hit rate for your custom ASIC business when engaging with prospective customers in the future, how should we think about the increasing competitive environment from the Arm ecosystem, Arm specifically with more versions than Neoverse, it's total design ecosystem, it's compute subsystems and as well all the ASIC design community. First of all, how do you feel about Arm essentially becoming more of a competitor? And then as well, how do you think about the way in which you'll compete against that and succeed?\nMatt Murphy: Look, I think there's a in this market today, there's obviously a lot of excitement because of the opportunity in front of us. I mean the way that we're working is there's a number of companies that are our partners, solution providers, et cetera that may or may have their own offering or not, whether it gets taken up or not as we'll have to see. Where we come together really is we pull it all together. We're able to actually deliver with Marvell intellectual property, design methodology and techniques, our IP, and our know-how pulled together with our customers RTL and IP and partners, the total solution, which means we actually lay the chip out. We package it up. we manufacture it in high volume. We QA it, we test it, we yield it, we drive reliability, we drive cost improvement, and we drive it through the cycle. And that is a very different business model than providing a piece that goes in. And so Arm has been our partner for a long time. We use them in our products kind of all over the place. And as they evolve and others evolve, we'll figure that out too. But in the end, it comes down to, we believe, for these large volume mission-critical big compute silicon chips it's going to require somebody like a Marvell with the manufacturing scale, the design techniques and know-how to really execute it. And so we haven't seen any change there. And in fact, I think at the sort of 3-nanometer node we're at and beyond, it's going to be even more critical to have a partner who's got your back, who can help you get to production quickly and spin derivatives quickly, which is now increasingly looking like what\u2019s going to be needed, more SKUs, higher -- faster beat rate in terms of when products are released and then obviously ramping them very hard and quickly given the competitive environment.\nOperator: The next question will come from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.\nHarlan Sur: Matt, you mentioned the initial shipments of your AI ASIC program. Can you just clarify because I know last you updated us, these programs were in qualification. So have you guys passed qual on both these programs? And is it sort of the initial start of the full production ramp? Or maybe you're still in qual, but you've got enough line of sight to passing the qual just given you're at the tail end of this process? And maybe more importantly, have you guys secured the follow-on AI programs for these two initial projects?\nMatt Murphy: So yes, we are in the initial start of the production ramp on both products. And then as far as the follow-on, like I said, the opportunity funnel we see across all of the various opportunities right now is significant, and we're involved in, we believe, we think, every single one of them. So yes, and there'll be more to come sort of at our AI Day, but I would just say our 3-nanometer funnel and our 3-nanometer hit rate and design win rate is very encouraging and it really gives us this tremendous confidence in where this business is headed. It also has a side benefit by driving this advanced technology for the custom ASIC side, is it's pulling along the technology development that benefits all the other businesses in Marvell, like our high-performance switching, our DSP for optics, et cetera. So there's actually kind of a virtuous cycle happening where being at that bleeding edge is now we're able to show our other solutions that interoperate with this custom silicon, really a best-in-class roadmap there. But more on the overall strategy and opportunity size at the AI though. [indiscernible].\nOperator: Your next question will come from Tore Svanberg with Stifel.\nTore Svanberg: Matt, I had a question on the 800-gig upgrade cycle. So you mentioned that ramping, but you also mentioned 1.6 Terabit ramping later this year. My understanding is that we're still in the early stages of the 800 gig. And I'm just wondering if you expect a more broad-based 800-gig upgrade cycle before 1.6T really starts to take off? Or will we potentially see kind of both ramping at the same time?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, I think there's three different pieces we should talk about. So the first is 1.6T. I would just call that early shipments, first volumes type of thing in the second half, end of the year and then more next year. And that's really, I'd call the early adoption of that technology. But it's very promising because that's obviously what's going to follow. The 800 gig for AI has still got tons of legs, right? And it's going to be very, very strong this year, very, very strong next year. And then there'll be some transition over time. And then I think what you're also indicating is, at some point, you're going to see an 800-gig transition on traditional cloud infrastructure from either 200-gig or 400-gig to 800-gig and that is also true in something we're planning for. So I think they're going to end up happening kind of all them in parallel a little bit, right? You're going to have leading-edge people adopting 1.6T. You're going to have the bulk of the volume on AI, still driving 800-gig for the next few years and then you're going to have a transition on the traditional PAM side as well that's going to upgrade. So I think they\u2019re all going to be in production in parallel for different reasons, which is great because it just ends up being multiple customers, multiple SKUs and kind of a rich portfolio of solutions that we\u2019re offering so that people can optimize their systems for the best TCO and the best performance that they need.\nOperator: We will take our last question today from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James.\nSrini Pajjuri: Just a follow-up to one of the previous questions, Matt, about the custom silicon opportunity going forward. Obviously, there are four big cloud customers, hyperscale customers. And based on what we know so far, most of them seem to be investing in custom silicon either 1 or 2 chips. So it does feel like the number of opportunities are relatively small. Of course, these are very large opportunities. Just curious, how do you see that evolving? Do you see this continuing with 1 or 2 programs for each customers, which are in a multibillion opportunities or are you seeing spreading out kind of more diverse opportunities as we -- I guess, as AI becomes bigger and broader? Just want to hear your thoughts on that.\nMatt Murphy: The way I think about it is if you go back just a couple of years, when AI was emerging, there was kind of 1 chip, 1 program that would sort of happen. It would take several years, then you gear up for the next one. And there was definitely a serial type of approach, and that was probably fine. I think what we've seen, to your point is really multiple programs now across all the key customers and that's kind of where I'd leave it. I think getting more specific, I don't really want to do that with respect to my customers. But I would just say what we hear is very much a need for each of them meeting their own very differentiated unique solutions, meeting more SKUs and at a much more rapid rate by far than we've seen so far. And so I just think it's creating -- I think, I know it's creating just a very significant, now, opportunity in custom silicon that really wasn't there before in terms of the total dollars that are available, the number of chips and then the speed that they want to go. And that\u2019s why earlier I had said, if you look at this kind of 3-nanometer cycle we\u2019re in, it\u2019s significantly larger than we saw back at 5-nanometer, even if you account for the fact that some of these the 5-nanometer TAMs have gone up a lot because the market went up, even if you sort of factor that in, what we\u2019re looking at is a lot more. And I think that\u2019s just going to continue for the next few years. But sure, by design, I think any of the high-volume data center applications are always going to in any product line, by the way, always concentrate down to a few key partners. That\u2019s just the way the business works. But super exciting time. There\u2019s a lot of activity here. Was that the last question operator?\nOperator: Yes, sir. Go ahead sir, take the floor.\nMatt Murphy: Excellent. All right. So first, everybody appreciate the participation on the call today. It's a very exciting time in the semiconductor industry relative to sort of the opportunity that's in front of us. We see a huge transformation underway right now with fundamentally a complete overhaul of data centers and data center architectures. And Marvell, we've been on this journey for the last four or five years to really transition and transform ourselves into a data center company. And as you've seen from our recent results now that is our largest end market, it's where we're putting the majority of our R&D effort, and we're positioning the company to win big here. We chose the strategy years ago to be really levered to the accelerated computing and infrastructure part of the market, which includes in the most prominent piece being AI. It's become much larger of an opportunity than we thought a few years ago, but it's a market we clearly chose to invest in. We're expecting a lot of growth in the coming year in our data center business. We're very excited about that. And some of these programs as I indicated, they're just getting started, and some of them are ramping in the second half. Some of them are starting to ramp now, but it really gives us a great setup for our fiscal '26. And kind of final couple of comments. I get a lot of thought about -- and we did a lot of work with our customers over the break this past December. And early January, I did a fireside chat with Harlan at JPM, and there was a lot of excitement after that call because we had gained confidence at that point about some of the production ramps. I would say just a couple of months later now sitting here on this call, our confidence in our growth this year and the robustness of these programs has only gotten stronger and only increased. So we\u2019re very excited about where the company is positioned. I appreciate everybody\u2019s support and interest in Marvell. And I look forward to seeing everybody at the AI Day. Team is working extremely hard, and they will not disappoint. So thanks, everybody. We\u2019ll see you soon. Bye.\nOperator: Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our fiscal year 2024 results. Marvell delivered $5.5 billion in revenue with a strong second half performance from our data center end market. Driven by AI applications, our data center revenue in the second half grew by approximately 50% over the first half. GAAP gross margin was 41.6%, GAAP operating margin was negative 10.3% and GAAP loss per diluted share was $1.08. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 61.2%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29%. And our non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.51. We returned $357 million to shareholders through dividends and buybacks. Moving on to our financial results for the fourth quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $1.427 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, growing 1% on a year-over-year and sequential basis. Data center was our largest end market, driving 54% of total revenue. The next largest was enterprise networking with 19%, followed by carrier infrastructure at 12%, consumer at 10% and auto industrial at 5%. GAAP gross margin was 46.6%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 63.9%, growing 330 basis points sequentially, driven by a significantly better product mix as we had expected. Moving on to operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses were $697 million, including stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $429 million, in line with our guidance. These results reflect the successful completion of our fiscal 2024 cost reduction plan we had outlined at the beginning of the year. GAAP operating margin was negative 2.3%, while non-GAAP operating margin was 33.8%. For the fourth quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.45, non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.46, growing 12% sequentially. Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations in the fourth quarter was $547 million. I'm pleased to report to you our second straight quarter, delivering robust operating cash flow of over $500 million. Our inventory at the end of the fourth quarter was $864 million, decreasing by $77 million from the prior quarter. Our DSO was 77 days, decreasing by a day from the prior quarter. We returned $52 million to shareholders through cash dividends. In addition, we repurchased $100 million of our stock during the fourth quarter, doubling from the prior quarter. We expect to further increase repurchases in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. As you saw earlier today, Marvel's Board has approved the largest repurchase authorization in our history, increasing our current plan by $3 billion, which brings our total available authorization to $3.3 billion. Our total debt was $4.17 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.19x and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.69x. As of the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $951 million, increasing by $225 million from the prior quarter. Turning to our guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.15 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 44.5% to 47.2%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 62% to 63%. We are forecasting a sequential decrease in non-GAAP gross margin due to lower revenue impacting fixed cost absorption. Looking forward, we expect that the overall level of revenue and product mix will remain key determinants of our gross margin in any given quarter. For the first quarter, we project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $676 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $455 million. This forecast includes a step-up from the prior quarter due to typical seasonality in payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases. For the first quarter, we expect other income and expense including interest on our debt to be approximately $48 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate of 7% for the first quarter. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding to be $866 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be $875 million. We anticipate GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of a loss of $0.18 to a loss of $0.28. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.18 to $0.28. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, so we're really working with customers to focus on Q1 being the bottom, really confident that, that's the bottom. And then we see growth resuming in the second half across enterprise networking, carrier and consumer. So really just trying to make sure that we put this behind us really quickly and see growth in the second half."

            "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, Marvell delivered revenue of $1.43 billion, growing 1% sequentially above the midpoint of guidance. In addition, on a non-GAAP basis, the Marvell team drove a substantial 330 basis point sequential increase in gross margin, completed execution on the OpEx reduction plan we outlined earlier in the year and delivered earnings per share of $0.46, growing 12% sequentially. As Willem will tell you in greater detail, we also drove another strong quarter of operating cash and increased share repurchases. We are pleased to report these results to you and remains a challenging macro environment. In our data center end market for the fourth quarter, we drove record revenue of $765 million, above our guidance, growing 54% year-over-year and 38% sequentially. The strong revenue growth in the quarter was driven by the cloud portion of our data center end markets. While AI has been a key growth driver, I am pleased that our standard cloud infrastructure revenue has also grown every quarter, and we see that continuing next year. Our 800-gig PAM solutions led our growth in the fourth quarter. We also benefited from higher sequential demand for our storage products as that portion of our data center end market continues its recovery. Revenue from our Teralynx Ethernet switches also grew sequentially in the quarter. Turning to the first quarter of fiscal 2025. We expect our overall data center revenue to grow in the low single-digits sequentially on a percentage basis. We expect revenue from both AI and standard cloud data centers to continue to grow sequentially. We project our electro-optics revenue to continue to be strong, and we also expect to benefit from the initial shipments of our cloud optimized AI silicon programs. Partially offsetting this growth, we are projecting a more than seasonal sequential decline in revenue from enterprise on-premise data centers. Over the past several years, Marvell has strategically invested in technology, both organically and through acquisitions to become a critical enabler of accelerated infrastructure. The seismic shift driven by AI in the data center market is creating new opportunities, and we are actively investing to lead the next wave of innovation. We have in place a full suite of solutions across data center interconnect, switching and compute, and the ability to uniquely stitch these together into a unified platform, a true one-stop shop for our data center customers. While our 100-gig per lane 800-gig PAM products are currently the workhorse for interconnect inside AI data centers, customers have begun qualifying our next-generation 200-gig per Lane 1.6T PAM solutions. We expect first deployments to start towards the end of this year. Complementing our optical interconnect solutions, we expect to start ramping our PAM DSPs for active electrical cables. This is a new and completely additive market for Marvell and we expect to be shipping products to multiple Tier 1 cloud customers this year. Our DCI products, which provide connectivity between data centers are critical to our customers' success and continue to do very well. We see exciting new opportunities ahead of us from growth in generative AI applications, driving cloud customers to build new data centers. We also expect a positive uplift from increased investment in inferencing, which will drive more bandwidth between data centers. We are shipping our 400-gig DCI products in high volume today and are seeing strong interest for our next-generation 800-gig products. I'm also very pleased to report to you that in fiscal 2024, we significantly expanded our DCI customer base with design wins at multiple data center customers. We expect these design wins to begin ramping next year. As you will remember from prior calls, Marvell silicon photonics technology has been a critical enabler of our DCI modules. You will hear more at OFC and our upcoming AI event about how we plan to deploy our field-proven silicon photonics technology to enable next-generation higher density, lower power interconnects. In data center switching, our Teralynx 12.8T products continue to ship in high volume and we are on track for production shipments of our next-generation 51.2T switch later this year. The Teralynx product line, you will recall, came from our Innovium acquisition. Combine the Innovium team with Marvell's very successful enterprise and carrier switching organization. This larger scale now enables Marvell to accelerate our development to address new cloud opportunities, particularly in switching for AI deployments. We are encouraged by the traction we are seeing with both existing and new customers, which has expanded our opportunity funnel for cloud switching dramatically over the past year. Turning to our cloud optimized silicon platform. We're seeing significant progress with the first set of design wins outlined during our last Investor Day. We expect initial shipments for our two AI compute programs to start in the first quarter and are on track for a very substantial ramp in the second half of the fiscal year. Customer bring up of these programs is going extremely well, and we are tightly aligned with them on volume expectations and working in lockstep to enable the production. We now have a clear view of demand for both this fiscal year as well as fiscal 2026. We have been working closely with our suppliers and are confident that we have secured capacity for the ramp. With the visibility we now have for these programs, along with many new opportunities, we are very excited about the potential scale of long-term revenue for Marvell from this business. As the initial set of design wins reach its full run rate, we expect annual revenue from cloud optimized silicon has the potential to rival our fast-growing data center optics business, which, for reference, grew to over $1 billion in fiscal 2024. With the exploding investment in AI and accelerated computing, the demand for cloud optimized silicon has grown significantly. We have successfully executed multiple 5-nanometer designs in the last two years and are deeply engaged with cloud customers on many new 3-nanometer opportunities. These engagements are driving a substantial increase in the size of our design funnel. AI is increasing the cadence of new chip releases and this plays well to Marvell's strength as a key partner for our cloud customers with a proven ASIC platform. We have a broad suite of differentiated IP, including ultra high-speed SerDes, armed compute, security, storage and advanced packaging, including die-to-die interconnects and chiplets. We are well positioned to act as a force multiplier for our cloud customers, enabling them to scale multiple custom programs in quick succession. Now let me turn to Marvell's carrier and enterprise end markets together. As we have been communicating, these end markets have been dealing with a period of soft industry demand. As a result, both were down sequentially in the fourth quarter and we expect them to decline again in the first quarter. On a sequential basis, we expect revenue in the first quarter from carrier to decline by approximately 50% and enterprise networking to decline by approximately 40%. Looking ahead, we expect revenue declines in these end markets to be behind us after the first quarter and forecast a recovery in the second half of the fiscal year. Longer term, these are large and enduring end markets, which are critical to the global economy. As a result, we expect both of these end markets to eventually return to contributing over $1 billion each in revenue on an annual basis once demand normalizes, and we begin to realize the benefits of upcoming Marvell-specific product cycles. Turning to the consumer end market. Revenue declined in the fourth quarter as expected and is projected to decline approximately 70% sequentially in the first quarter. This forecast reflects the completion of deliveries for an end-of-life program in the prior quarter as well as significantly weaker demand from the game console market. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $82 million, declining 17% year-over-year and 22% sequentially. As expected, the sequential weakness was primarily driven by a sharp decline in the industrial portion of this end market, where order patterns can be lumpy in any given quarter. Fiscal 2024, our automotive business delivered another strong year, with revenue growing in the double-digits year-over-year on a percentage basis. We are benefiting from growth in Marvell content driven by an increase in the number of Ethernet connected endpoints in cars, coupled with the need for more bandwidth. We've continued to accumulate new Ethernet design wins across a broad swath of automotive OEMs. While the initial wave of our automotive revenue was driven primarily by EVs and hybrids, we now have also on high-volume internal combustion vehicles with major auto OEMs. These wins tend to be multi-platform in nature, covering numerous models simultaneously. Turning now to our forecast for the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we expect revenue from our overall auto and industrial end market to be flat sequentially. In summary, in fiscal 2024, we delivered total revenue of $5.5 billion. Our data center revenue accelerated throughout the year, growing from about a third of total company revenue in the first quarter to more than half exiting the fourth quarter. As customers continue to shift investment from traditional to accelerated infrastructure, we expect data center to drive the majority of our revenue growth going forward. This transition underscores Marvell's transformation into a leading data center company. AI was a key driver of our data center growth in fiscal 2024, contributing over 10% of total company revenue, well above our initial forecast. This was a substantial increase from approximately 3% in the prior year. Our momentum accelerated throughout the fiscal year with AI revenue well over $200 million in the fourth quarter, driven mostly from Optics. In fiscal 2025, we expect this trend to continue driving another strong year for our data center end market. We expect a substantial base of electro-optics revenue from AI should remain correlated to accelerator shipments. And as those continue to grow, we expect to benefit accordingly. In addition, we project significant revenue contributions from our AI cloud optimized programs, well in excess of our prior estimate of a couple of hundred million dollars in fiscal 2025. In fact, as our cloud optimized AI silicon programs reach high-volume production, we expect our overall cloud optimized revenue to exceed $200 million exiting the fourth quarter. As a result, on a run rate basis, this momentum would put our overall cloud optimized silicon revenue above the annual $800 million target we had provided at our last Investor Day. And with the full year of contributions in fiscal 2026, we expect to be way ahead of the prior target. In aggregate, we see a favorable setup for the second half of this fiscal year, driven by continued growth from our data center end market, ongoing growth from automotive, and a recovery in carrier, enterprise and consumer. As we continue to drive revenue growth, we remain focused on strong cash flow generation and returning capital to investors. As you saw earlier today, Marvell's Board has approved the largest repurchase authorization in our history. We view the emergence of accelerated infrastructure as one of the most significant technology inflections of our time. I thank all our dedicated employees and leaders for executing on our strategy to fully capitalize on this remarkable opportunity. During a tumultuous period for the semiconductor industry, we have taken control of our destiny and are strategically investing to win. Earlier today, we announced the extension of our long-standing collaboration with TSMC to develop the industry's first technology platform to produce 2-nanometer semiconductors optimized for accelerated infrastructure. This new platform will enable Marvell to deliver substantial advancements in performance, power and area critical for next-generation accelerated workloads. We are very optimistic about our growth prospects and our role in enabling accelerated infrastructure. We look forward to updating investors on the massive opportunity in front of us at our accelerated infrastructure for the AI ERA event on April 11 in New York City. With that, I'll turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Yes, definitely a tale of two cities. On the carrier enterprise and consumer side, the way to think about it is, sure, the drops are pretty steep in Q4 and Q1. We're definitely going through a cyclical downturn in the industry, you've been doing this a long time, so have I, we've seen that happen, and that's what we're going through. The way to think about both of those businesses is at their peak, together, they were about $2.5 billion in revenue, and this would sort of be during the pandemic and some of the supply chain issues that went on. You can now see we're shipping well below that. And so I said in my prepared remarks, both of these are very solid businesses, Ross, for Marvell. Both will recover to greater than $1 billion in revenue, over time, the question is when. And remember as well, within these businesses, these are very long product life cycles, typically like seven years in production. So these are designs. In some cases, we won 3 or 4, 5 years ago, some of them we just won a year or two ago. So we feel good about these businesses, but they are going through some demand softness and some inventory correction, but we expect to see that behind us. And to be very specific, none of this is due to any business that's not \u201ccoming back or share loss\u201d. And in fact, when things recover back to a normalized run rate, we do have Marvell product growth drivers in both of those segments, carrier and enterprise to drive growth going forward. So we're just managing through it in the short term. Okay. Let me just tackle them both. On the first one, yes, super excited about the ramp we're seeing now on the custom silicon programs we won a couple of years back. So we're shipping in Q1 on both programs. It's fantastic. We gave some color in the prepared remarks on the exit rate being $200 million plus. I don't want to cap that at this point, but certainly, that's sort of the way to think about it as the floor, and then we go from there. So that would imply, obviously, in fiscal '26, a much larger number than the $800 million we had called out. And again, I think it's still dynamic and still early but we're very excited from the bullish forecast we're seeing from our customers. So '26 looks very strong from the programs that we've won, and we should be way ahead of the plan that we had articulated a ways back. On the second question, yes, I don't think I've ever seen more design win activity in my career as right now, in AI, custom silicon, networking, optics, you name it, this whole transformation that's going on and data center architectures is creating this massive opportunity for Marvell specifically on the custom portion of it. I mean, we're talking about a TAM creation that's going to be in the tens of billions of dollars range. And we'll talk more about that at our AI Day. But very significant sort of opportunity that's emerging in front of us. And that being said, I view that as very complementary to the merchant leader in this space. I think both have a place given the workloads that are required, given the scale of computing that's needed. And I don't think it's a zero-sum game. I've been saying this for a while. I think both segments, the merchant side as well as the custom side are going to grow to be very enormous TAMs. And so yes, we're right in the mix on all the major opportunities and programs. We have assembled an incredible team, an incredible portfolio of technology. We announced today our continued partnership with TSMC with a very full and robust roadmap of IP and technology to specifically address AI and accelerated computing applications for the next generation. So that's got a lot of excitement with the customers as well. So yes, overall, we're very bullish, and we think the whole -- all the boats are going to lift on this one and certainly for Marvell creates a huge new TAM opportunity that we really didn't have just a few years ago. Yes, hopefully, some of the custom numbers were helpful. Investors last year and this year, there was a lot of interest in sort of what the size of that was. And now that we've got the visibility, it's great to start articulating where we think that is. I think on your second sort of piece of your question around training versus inference and compute. At this point, I would just put it in a very large bucket of what I'm calling decabillions [ph] in TAM creation. I don't know that we're -- I'm on this call certainly prepared to slice it out. And I don't even think we know where this is going to be in three to five years relative to that exact split. But I would say the opportunity set for us crosses all of those applications, okay? And then relative to where we are in terms of our technology, our competitiveness, I mean it's pretty astonishing if you think about it. When we won the designs we won, Chris, at 5-nanometer, that was really our first time as Marvell to compete in this segment, especially in the data center. The origins of this business go back to our purchase of Avera in 2019. We pivoted that roadmap during dependency of the close and right after from 14-nanometer technology all the way to 5-nanometer and even though it was our first time out, SerDes was competitive, packaging technology, interconnect, manufacturing scale, strategic partnerships up and down the supply chain, and that enabled us to win a significant share of ASICs in business, which is now coming to fruition here in fiscal '25 and '26. We followed that up with our 3-nanometer platform, which has now been a big part of the opportunity set in the funnel we're competing in today. We are in a completely different position now relative to 5-nanometer because we had the learnings, we had the readiness. And now we're really leaning in, okay, in terms of being a first mindset around not just nanometers, but die-to-die interconnect, packaging, SerDes technology, optics and really in chiplets and think about how to stitch all this together. And on top of that, with the scale of Marvell and our strategic partnerships, we really look to our customers like an incredibly solid, trustworthy long-term partner for their needs to really help them realize their AI silicon ambitions. So that's where we are today. I mean we did great on 5-nanometer, we're going to do great on 3-nanometer, and we're going to do great in the future. Thanks. Sure. Yes. I mean on the way we've talked about that business, actually since Avera in 2019 is that it would always due to the nature of custom business be at a lower gross margin overall than the company average and the target. At the same time, because of the NRE and non-recurring engineering that we receive as part of the customer funding of these programs, the operating margins of this business tend to be very competitive and over time, in line with our company targets. When you start talking about these very, very large programs, you've got opportunity given the volume and scale on the OM line to really drive a lot of leverage in the model. But the GMs, just due to the nature of that business model will always be a little bit lower than the total. I would say, though, at the same time, because the sort of follow-on sometimes is we'll see if that happens and what happens to the overall company gross margin profile. And remember, we still have very strong gross margin merchant businesses in storage and in networking, automotive. Some of those were even under-shipping demand right now. So as the year plays out, some of those businesses will come back and that should be a little bit of a margin offset to some of the custom stuff. So we're still managing to our long-term target model. But yes, the cloud stuff, especially if these volumes certainly lower gross margin. You got a quick one for the second? We can do it, otherwise, we've got to [indiscernible]. Yes. I think what I'd say is it's absolutely a real market. We felt that way for some time. Even back when we acquired Inphi, that was sort of a shot on goal we thought was possible. I think the big news is that we're qualifying at multiple hyperscalers now. We're starting to go into production this year. We'll get a very nice, solid kind of more full year-ish ramp in fiscal '26 but it's definitely an incremental additive category to Marvell. And it really leverages our high-speed or high-performance DSP and PAM technology, which is really now inflecting in this wave of AC before it was based on the older modulation techniques which where we didn't participate. So yes, really excited about it, but let it play out for a few more quarters. Okay. Let me do this. I'll take the first one, and I'll let Willem take the second one. So I can take a breather and he can you can also answer your question. Yes, on the first one, I think we gave some pretty good color. I mean, if you think about it, the Q4 exit rate on AI, right, was well north of $200 million. And the bulk of that, as we said, was in optics. So if you just -- and then you can start extrapolating well jeez, and you got to add in how much revenue is Marvell getting on the standard cloud side in optics, and that's another very nice chunk. And then you've got some of the stuff that we have that shows up on the carrier side, I'm talking about Inphi now, on the coherent DSPs. There's some ASICs that we have. So the overall Inphi business, if that's what you're asking, since we bought it has clearly outperformed the deal model and has just become an incredibly strategic asset for us, both in terms of just the technology we picked up, but the team, the synergy with the other portfolio, the other product lines we have, and so just super positive about that, and it looks like that whole opportunity is going to be much larger than I think we were in [indiscernible] just a few years back. Willem, do you want to take the second part of it? Well, I think it depends on how you -- the definition of breather you use. I mean, basically, it's ramped up just so significantly, right, the Electro-optics business Q2 to Q3, Q3 to Q4, and staying strong in Q1, maybe it's a breather from the sequential growth point of view, but we still have not seen that slow down. And then on the -- let's see, I got your second one. The third one was on 1.6T, I'll come back to your second one in a second. That is going to ramp later this year. That's gone really well. The quals and the product bring up. We announced at OFC last year and a lot of demand and interest. And then sorry, your second question on AI? Yes. Sorry, yes, the accelerator. For sure. The way we think about it is the -- that business year-over-year should grow in line with accelerator growth -- accelerator unit growth. We view it as very correlated. Obviously, there's some timing issues in terms of supply chain and things like that. But that's a simple way to think about it, and everyone's got a little bit of a different model at this point about what that number is, but our view is we're highly correlated to accelerator shipments, in our optics business. Look, I think there's a in this market today, there's obviously a lot of excitement because of the opportunity in front of us. I mean the way that we're working is there's a number of companies that are our partners, solution providers, et cetera that may or may have their own offering or not, whether it gets taken up or not as we'll have to see. Where we come together really is we pull it all together. We're able to actually deliver with Marvell intellectual property, design methodology and techniques, our IP, and our know-how pulled together with our customers RTL and IP and partners, the total solution, which means we actually lay the chip out. We package it up. we manufacture it in high volume. We QA it, we test it, we yield it, we drive reliability, we drive cost improvement, and we drive it through the cycle. And that is a very different business model than providing a piece that goes in. And so Arm has been our partner for a long time. We use them in our products kind of all over the place. And as they evolve and others evolve, we'll figure that out too. But in the end, it comes down to, we believe, for these large volume mission-critical big compute silicon chips it's going to require somebody like a Marvell with the manufacturing scale, the design techniques and know-how to really execute it. And so we haven't seen any change there. And in fact, I think at the sort of 3-nanometer node we're at and beyond, it's going to be even more critical to have a partner who's got your back, who can help you get to production quickly and spin derivatives quickly, which is now increasingly looking like what's going to be needed, more SKUs, higher -- faster beat rate in terms of when products are released and then obviously ramping them very hard and quickly given the competitive environment. So yes, we are in the initial start of the production ramp on both products. And then as far as the follow-on, like I said, the opportunity funnel we see across all of the various opportunities right now is significant, and we're involved in, we believe, we think, every single one of them. So yes, and there'll be more to come sort of at our AI Day, but I would just say our 3-nanometer funnel and our 3-nanometer hit rate and design win rate is very encouraging and it really gives us this tremendous confidence in where this business is headed. It also has a side benefit by driving this advanced technology for the custom ASIC side, is it's pulling along the technology development that benefits all the other businesses in Marvell, like our high-performance switching, our DSP for optics, et cetera. So there's actually kind of a virtuous cycle happening where being at that bleeding edge is now we're able to show our other solutions that interoperate with this custom silicon, really a best-in-class roadmap there. But more on the overall strategy and opportunity size at the AI though. [indiscernible]. Yes, I think there's three different pieces we should talk about. So the first is 1.6T. I would just call that early shipments, first volumes type of thing in the second half, end of the year and then more next year. And that's really, I'd call the early adoption of that technology. But it's very promising because that's obviously what's going to follow. The 800 gig for AI has still got tons of legs, right? And it's going to be very, very strong this year, very, very strong next year. And then there'll be some transition over time. And then I think what you're also indicating is, at some point, you're going to see an 800-gig transition on traditional cloud infrastructure from either 200-gig or 400-gig to 800-gig and that is also true in something we're planning for. So I think they're going to end up happening kind of all them in parallel a little bit, right? You're going to have leading-edge people adopting 1.6T. You're going to have the bulk of the volume on AI, still driving 800-gig for the next few years and then you're going to have a transition on the traditional PAM side as well that's going to upgrade. So I think they're all going to be in production in parallel for different reasons, which is great because it just ends up being multiple customers, multiple SKUs and kind of a rich portfolio of solutions that we're offering so that people can optimize their systems for the best TCO and the best performance that they need. The way I think about it is if you go back just a couple of years, when AI was emerging, there was kind of 1 chip, 1 program that would sort of happen. It would take several years, then you gear up for the next one. And there was definitely a serial type of approach, and that was probably fine. I think what we've seen, to your point is really multiple programs now across all the key customers and that's kind of where I'd leave it. I think getting more specific, I don't really want to do that with respect to my customers. But I would just say what we hear is very much a need for each of them meeting their own very differentiated unique solutions, meeting more SKUs and at a much more rapid rate by far than we've seen so far. And so I just think it's creating -- I think, I know it's creating just a very significant, now, opportunity in custom silicon that really wasn't there before in terms of the total dollars that are available, the number of chips and then the speed that they want to go. And that's why earlier I had said, if you look at this kind of 3-nanometer cycle we're in, it's significantly larger than we saw back at 5-nanometer, even if you account for the fact that some of these the 5-nanometer TAMs have gone up a lot because the market went up, even if you sort of factor that in, what we're looking at is a lot more. And I think that's just going to continue for the next few years. But sure, by design, I think any of the high-volume data center applications are always going to in any product line, by the way, always concentrate down to a few key partners. That's just the way the business works. But super exciting time. There's a lot of activity here. Was that the last question operator? Excellent. All right. So first, everybody appreciate the participation on the call today. It's a very exciting time in the semiconductor industry relative to sort of the opportunity that's in front of us. We see a huge transformation underway right now with fundamentally a complete overhaul of data centers and data center architectures. And Marvell, we've been on this journey for the last four or five years to really transition and transform ourselves into a data center company. And as you've seen from our recent results now that is our largest end market, it's where we're putting the majority of our R&D effort, and we're positioning the company to win big here. We chose the strategy years ago to be really levered to the accelerated computing and infrastructure part of the market, which includes in the most prominent piece being AI. It's become much larger of an opportunity than we thought a few years ago, but it's a market we clearly chose to invest in. We're expecting a lot of growth in the coming year in our data center business. We're very excited about that. And some of these programs as I indicated, they're just getting started, and some of them are ramping in the second half. Some of them are starting to ramp now, but it really gives us a great setup for our fiscal '26. And kind of final couple of comments. I get a lot of thought about -- and we did a lot of work with our customers over the break this past December. And early January, I did a fireside chat with Harlan at JPM, and there was a lot of excitement after that call because we had gained confidence at that point about some of the production ramps. I would say just a couple of months later now sitting here on this call, our confidence in our growth this year and the robustness of these programs has only gotten stronger and only increased. So we're very excited about where the company is positioned. I appreciate everybody's support and interest in Marvell. And I look forward to seeing everybody at the AI Day. Team is working extremely hard, and they will not disappoint. So thanks, everybody. We'll see you soon. Bye."

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's third fiscal quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's Chairman and CEO; and Willem Meintjes, our CFO. Let me remind everyone that certain comments made today include forward-looking statements which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Let me now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on this quarter. Matt? \nMatt Murphy : Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Marvell delivered revenue of $1.42 billion, growing 6% sequentially above the midpoint of guidance. In addition, on a non-GAAP basis, the Marvell team drove a sequential increase in gross margin, remain disciplined on operating expenses and delivered EPS of $0.41, above the midpoint of our guidance. We are pleased with our results in execution.  In our data center end market, revenue for the third quarter was $556 million, well above our guidance, driven by stronger than forecasted AI revenue. We are also encouraged by revenue from cloud, returning to year-over-year growth. On a sequential basis, overall data center revenue grew 21% in the third quarter, while cloud grew well in excess of 30%.  As expected revenue from the enterprise on-premise portion of our data center end market declined sequentially in the third quarter, reflecting weakening demand. Demand for data center storage also remains depressed, and industry expectations for recovery have continued to push out.  In cloud, revenue from both AI and standard cloud infrastructure grew sequentially, with AI growing significantly faster. Growth was broad based led by our PAM4 optical products. Teralynx Ethernet switches, as well as our data center interconnect, or DCI products.  Earlier today, we released a video highlighting our long standing collaboration with NVIDIA, where using Marvell's optical interconnect technology to enable the bandwidth scale and reliability required by Generative AI. Marvell has built a broad product portfolio which are customers are relying upon to power their accelerated computing infrastructure. We are benefiting from strong demand for 800-gig PAM electro-optic products, tightly correlated to the growth of in deployment of AI accelerators. In fact, we are seeing the overall attach rate of our PAM products to accelerators being higher than one to one in high performance AI systems currently shipping in the market.  We're also seeing strong customer traction for our next generation 1.6T 200-gig per lane PAM platform, that we started sampling this past April. Customer qualifications have begun and we are looking forward to ramping our 1.6T solution into production. Complementing our optical solutions, we expect our PAM DSPs for the active electrical cable, or AEC market to start ramping in our next fiscal year in Tier 1 cloud deployments. We also demonstrated our 224 gigabits per second, long-reach SerDes at the OCP Global Summit held in October. We expect that this technology will serve as a building block for our next generation 200-gig per lane AECs.  In our switching portfolio, we are making great progress on our next generation 51.2T cloud switching platform. At OCP, we demonstrated Marvell's 51.2T solution, operating at full capacity with very low industry leading latency running on SONiC. Our enabled Meta SONiC and agile open source network operating system is very important for cloud customers who value the flexibility, interoperability and scalability of an open Ethernet switch ecosystem. Customers have started development on our 51.2T solution, and we look forward to ramping this platform into production.  In addition, earlier this week, we announced our membership in the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. This is another step in our commitment to driving continuous innovation on an open Ethernet based cloud fabric, which can deliver the scale and performance required for next generation workloads including generative AI.  As our 400 gig DCI modules continue to ramp, we're also seeing strong interest for our next generation 800 gig products that we launched this past October. These modules are based on our new 5-nanometer 800 gig coherent DSP and silicon photonics, or SiPho platform, which integrates multiple discrete components within a single device. This level of integration enables the performance and packaging density required for small form factor pluggable modules to grab a high bandwidth signal across long distances between data centers. Marvell\u2019s SiPho platform has accumulated billions of operating hours over the past seven years in DCI applications.  In addition, we are starting to see emerging applications for our field proven SiPho technology to power next generation higher bandwidth and optical connections inside data centers. We look forward to updating investors as this opportunity unfolds over time.  Cloud customers remain focused on enhancing their AI offerings by building custom compute solutions of their own, and we have already won a number of these designs. We have completed qualification of 1 key AI project and have started wafers under production. For another project, we have received first silicon back from the fab and the initial testing is looking positive. As a result, we expect both of these custom compute programs to start volume production next year. Turning now to our guidance for overall data center end market. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenue from our data center end market to grow in the mid-30% range on a sequential basis. In our last earnings call, we provided a forecast for AI revenue to cross a $200 million quarterly run rate exiting this year. Since then, demand has continued to grow, and we now expect our AI revenue in the fourth quarter to come in significantly above our forecast.  In addition to strong growth from AI, we also expect revenue from standard cloud infrastructure to grow sequentially in the fourth quarter. For the enterprise on-premise portion of our data center end market, we expect revenue to decline sequentially in the fourth quarter. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $317 million, above guidance growing 17% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. The overachievement in the third quarter was driven entirely by the wireless portion of our carrier end market. Marvell specific product cycles have enabled our wireless revenue to buck the trend of a soft end market for several quarters. However, we have been forecasting for some time that this wave of above-market wireless growth for Marvell would start to decline by the fourth quarter as the initial wave of 5G rollout completion.  Additionally, demand is continuing to soften as carriers are managing CapEx in a difficult macroeconomic environment. As a result, following an extended multiyear period of strong growth, we are expecting a period of digestion. In addition, we expect revenue from the wired portion of our carrier end markets to continue to decline, reflecting weakening demand. As a result, for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue from our overall carrier end market to decline in the mid-40% range on a sequential basis. Looking longer term as data traffic continues to grow, we expect that operators will need to continue to invest in adding capacity in both the wireless and wired end markets. We also expect to benefit from share gains, including significant 5-nanometer base station design wins, which we have won but are not in production. We are optimistic that carrier CapEx will normalize over time, and our revenue from this end market will return to growth. Turning to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $271 million, declining 28% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. As we have been signaling, we see weak demand in this end market. As a result, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we project enterprise networking revenue to decline in the mid-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis.  Turning to our automotive and industrial end markets. Revenue in the third quarter was $107 million, growing 26% year-over-year and declining 3% sequentially. Looking to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenue from our overall auto and industrial end market to decline by approximately 20% on a sequential basis. We expect the sequential decline to come from our industrial end market, which includes aerospace and defense, where order patterns can be lumpy in any given quarter. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $169 million, declining 5% year-over and growing 1% sequentially. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting revenue from the consumer end market to sequentially decline in the mid-teens on a percentage basis. In summary, we delivered revenue and non-GAAP earnings above the midpoint of guidance for the fiscal third quarter. The diversification in our end markets is serving us well with strong growth from AI and cloud carrying us through a softening demand environment across other end markets.  Through fiscal 2024, the Marvell team has continued to execute in a dynamic environment, remaining focused on driving continuous improvement on what we can control while dealing with inventory corrections and macroeconomic-induced demand headwinds in many end markets.  We reprioritized our investments to align to the highest ROI opportunities in front of us. Our team drove efficiency improvements to reduce operating expenses, and we are well on track to meet our commitment. We've worked proactively with our customers and suppliers to best manage inventory across the combined supply chain. Our operations group has rapidly responded to the increase in demand from AI. At the midpoint of our guidance for the fourth quarter, we are forecasting that our revenue for the second half of this fiscal year should grow approximately 7% over the first half. In addition, we are forecasting a 300-plus basis point sequential improvement in our non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter. This projection reflects our expectation for an improving product mix as well as a multi-quarter cross-functional effort to further optimize our cost structure. Heading into next year, while we don't typically guide beyond a quarter, we expect softness in demand to impact revenue from our enterprise and carrier markets in the first quarter. We also anticipate a significant reduction in consumer end market revenue due to seasonality in demand and the completion of deliveries for an end-of-life program in the fourth quarter. Although the enterprise and carrier markets are experiencing near-term headwinds, these large and long-lasting end markets are critical to the global economy. So we expect them to recover and turn into our revenue tailwind over time. In the meantime, our data center revenue is growing rapidly, reflecting our emergence as a key enabler of accelerated computing. We project data center revenue, driven by the ongoing strength in our connectivity solutions inside and between data centers to grow to over 50% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter. Longer term, we expect additional tailwinds to data center growth from the ramp of multiple custom accelerated compute programs for AI. We are also looking forward to a number of new Marvell products entering the data center market, as I discussed earlier. With that, I'll turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nWillem Meintjes: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue in the third quarter was $1.49 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, declining 8% year-over-year and growing 6% sequentially. Data center was our largest end market driving 39% of total revenue. The next largest was carrier infrastructure with 22%, followed by enterprise networking at 19%, consumer at 12% and auto industrial at 8%. GAAP gross margin was 38.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.6%, growing 30 basis points sequentially, driven by higher revenue and cost improvements. Moving on to operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses were $698 million, including stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $437 million, in line with our guidance. GAAP operating margin was negative 10.3%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.8%. For the third quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.19. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.41, $0.01 above the midpoint of guidance. Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $503 million, which grew by $391 million sequentially. This significant growth was driven by our relative improvement in DSO, lower inventory along with better profitability. Our inventory at the end of the third quarter was $942 million decreasing by $74 million from the prior quarter. Our DSO was 78 days, reducing by 4 days from the prior quarter. Our CapEx was $54 million. We returned $52 million to shareholders through cash dividends and we repurchased $50 million of our stock during the third quarter. Our total debt was $4.19 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.21 times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.83 times.  During the quarter, we issued new bonds and used the proceeds to pay down our upcoming debt maturities. With our investment-grade credit rating, we were able to execute this refinancing while decreasing our average interest rate on our outstanding debt balance. In addition, we increased our average debt maturity from 3.9 years to 5.3 years. As of the end of the third fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $726 million increasing by $202 million from the prior quarter. Turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.42 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 48.2% to 50.7%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, with the midpoint projected to be back to the low end of our long-term target model. Our forecast for this large sequential improvement is driven by expectations of a significantly stronger product mix and our ongoing cost optimization activities. Looking forward, we expect that product mix as well as the overall level of revenue will remain key determinants of our gross margin in any given quarter. For the fourth quarter, we project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $680 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million. This level of operating expense reflects the completion of the cost reduction plan we communicated in our first fiscal quarter of this year. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we anticipate typical seasonality in payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases. As a result, we expect OpEx to increase by mid- to high single digits on a percentage basis. For the fourth quarter, we expect other income and expense, including interest on our debt to be approximately $50 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate of 6% for the fourth quarter, increasing to 7% in fiscal 2025. We expect our basic average shares outstanding to be 865 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be $874 million. We anticipate GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of a loss of $0.08 to a gain of $0.02 per share. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.41 to $0.51. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. \nToshiya Hari: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question. Matt, I had a multipart question on your data center business. It sounds like the outlook has improved since 90 days ago. Just curious how if you can size the AI business for us where you landed in the October quarter, it sounds like you'll be in excess of $200 million in Q4, but the outlook there. And then more importantly, into calendar '24, if you can speak to visibility you have across your optical business as well as the compute business that would be helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. We're very pleased with the performance of our data center business grew over 20%. In Q3, we're guiding it up 35%, in Q4, as you noted, that is driven by AI and the Q4 exit rate is well north now of $200 million. What's very encouraging as well is that the traditional cloud infrastructure piece of it is also growing nicely. That's come back very strong for us. And those two will be growth drivers for us into next year. We see continued weakness in softness, and this is a broader market statement than the on-premise piece and that probably persists for some time, but the mix now of cloud and AI is so much higher that it's driving the overall segment in a very positive trajectory, both in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And then as we head into next year, as you've seen, most of the strong growth we saw in the current fiscal year in AI and cloud infra for that matter has been in the optics area, but we are tracking well for growth their next year as well as the ramp of our custom silicon programs. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about the strong progress we made on new product development and starting to plan for ramps there.  So while we're not resizing those specifically, those -- the performance clearly in the fourth quarter as well as what you would how you think about next year is much, much stronger than when we first signaled the AI opportunity for Marvell a couple of quarters back. So I think things are tracking nicely. And as you said, compared to 90 days ago, I think the overall aggregate data center business, as you can see from our results, is doing quite well.\nToshiya Hari: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tim Arcuri of UBS. Please go ahead. \nTimothy Arcuri : Thanks a lot. Matt I also had a multipart question. So enterprise networking is going to be down about 35% from the peak in fiscal Q4. And the customers are still though reporting that their inventory levels are actually going up. So is this Marvell product? Is this product from another supplier? And can you talk about just the dynamics going on in that segment? And then also for fiscal Q1, do you still think that revenue can grow? I know you said that networking is down and carriers down. But data center would be up. Do you think that total revenue can be up? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Tim, and appreciate the creativity on the 2-parter, but no problem. On the enterprise side, it's hard to comment. I mean if you look, balance sheets are still pretty heavy from the OEMs out there. We've been saying, I think since even going back to December of last year that enterprise was going to come down this year and it's just continued to come down. I think there's a combination of both inventory management at the OEM level as well as from some of the projections you see out there at the end market level, a softer and more weakening demand environment.  So we still feel very good about our position. We had grown this business significantly from where it was just a few years ago. We had great years the last couple of years and even in the first half of this year. So we're going through what would be kind of a normal inventory correction cycle. It's taking a little bit longer than we thought if you went back to the beginning of the year, but I also think the macro and the environment has deteriorated more than we would have anticipated at that time. And so we see it down, and we see that having to work through that issue for the next couple of quarters. On Q1, while we don't guide specifically, I understand what you're looking for. I think the way to think about it is that, and I guess I gave the information. Carrier is down after a really great run in Q4, that's going to stay weak. The telco environment and CapEx spending is very constrained out there and the end customers seem to be having some trouble. We talked about enterprise being down. And then on consumer, which actually did a little bit better than we thought it would have this year. The last time buy program that we had has been largely going to conclude now in the fourth quarter, and so we see a stepping down there. So, if you kind of add all that up, that's about half our revenue that's going to come down in Q1. And then the real question is the data center strength and how does that continue? And it's too early to call, but just the way to think about it is it's a lot to offset at this juncture when you have that much of your revenue coming down.  The last thing I would say, though, on carrier and enterprise is that these are -- this is a cyclical downturn on these and the kind of design win strength we've had in the design position we had is such that these will recover, and they will come back to a normalized run rate over time. And when that happens, that will be a tailwind to EPS and a tailwind to revenue growth as that kind of think of it as the base business of Marvell returns to growth.  And in the meantime, our diversified strategy is working well because we've got AI and cloud that's really firing on all cylinders. So a lot of information there. You guys are going to have to up with your own model, but hopefully, that gave you some pieces on how to think about it.\nTimothy Arcuri: Wonderful. Thanks.\nOperator: The next question comes from Vivek Arya of Bank of America. Please go ahead. \nVivek Arya : Thanks for taking my question. Matt, so I think in the data center, the value of the optics business, I think, is well understood and appreciate it. The challenge is still for us to how we value your ASIC business. So is it 1 or 2 customers? Is it more customers? How is the visibility for the next 1 or 2 years? Like are we talking $100 million to $200 million next year? Are we talking $300 million, $400 million next year? Because unless we have a good way of sizing what this business is and what the visibility and what the growth potential, it's just very hard to value and give appropriate value to Marvell for this business. So could you just help us understand what is the right way you think about your ASIC business, can the lumpiness here really swing your sales next year?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I think a couple of ways to think about it. The first is on the customer opportunity, just by design, it's highly concentrated, if you think about it. And there's just a handful of companies that can really drive the kind of silicon TAM opportunity that that's out there. And you've probably seen in the last few weeks, there's just been a tremendous number of announcements across the industry around AI, whether it's strategic partnerships that are being announced, people doing their own silicon, behind that, their own silicon. There's typically partners there, people like Marvell, who are going to participate. So a lot of activity, you can see and I would say even one broader statement, then I'll get to your question.  We do see as the TAM is moving from traditional computing architectures to accelerated computing, it is really opening up the custom silicon piece of that. And so that we believe will be a larger portion of the TAM going forward. When we talked about sizing, if you remember, a couple of quarters back, our AI opportunity, we had signaled already that this year, we would do about $400 million on the optical area. Well, said another way, we do about $400 million this year in total AI revenue, most of it driven by optics and that next year would be about $800 million. That was the original sort of bogey we put out to help investors to your point, size this. And then you would assume some optics growth, and so you could sort of do the math on what the difference might be.  Now AI's got a bigger head of steam than it was back then. The optics piece is higher and we've made significant progress now on new product development in terms of getting the chips actually taped out and through the fab and now starting to think about ramping. But what I would say is, and I've been saying this to investors for about 6 months, we are not in a position to call the ball just yet on how big the custom silicon opportunity can be for next year. It's still early, Vivek. I understand the investor appetite for this.  I would say between us and our customers, we're not fully -- we don't fully know how big this can be yet. So I'm going to need a little bit more time to probably size that for you. But what I can say is from when we first talked about AI 2 quarters back and what the opportunity was looking out to next year, it's much, much higher. And that's both on the custom side as well as on the optic side. So I hope that helps. I understand the question, but it's a pretty dynamic market as you see what's going on. But the good news is it's all moving in a very positive and upward direction.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harsh Kumar of Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. \nHarsh Kumar : Yes. Thanks guys. Great tremendous execution and very choppy environment. So Matt, a question for you was on the carrier side, you're guiding down significantly down mid-40s on a sequential basis. And I think you mentioned both the wired and the wireless pieces are down. I was curious if you can help us think about perhaps what is taking the bigger part of the hit. And which one do you have more confidence in, in terms of returning back to growth first?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Harsh. And it is a choppy environment, as you point out. Look, I think on carrier, we're coming off a very, very strong Q3. It was over $300 million. And I think if you just kind of infer the whole year, it's going to be -- have been like a $1 billion business for Marvell. So I think that's been a success story for us. Clearly, some -- and we've been trying to signal if you go back over the last couple of calls, we've attempted to signal to investors the fourth quarter that there would be -- that sort of the third quarter would be the peak of 5G stuff, and then it would take some time for that to judge that through. And we bucked the trend, if you remember, on our performance here. So both of those are -- that carrier segment is a strong segment for Marvell. It will return over time, back to a normalized run rate, but it's very lumpy and volatile as carrier usually is. What I would say on the timing, I think they're both going to come back. It's just -- it's hard to know exactly when on these. I think the predictability in the segment is tough. So I don't think I have an exact answer on which one comes back sooner. I'd say wire has been trending down for some time as I think some of that pandemic led infrastructure build has waned. The carrier 5G stuff has really performed extremely well for us this year.  And by the way, when it does come back, both on the carrier on the wireless and wired side, we have incremental design wins in those segments. One is incremental content base stations with the Layer 2 processor opportunity and also our new 800-gig DSPs for carrier -- for wired infrastructure, those are going to be new revenue drivers for us when we come back out of this. So timing is still unknown. But I would just say that this is a part of the base business of Marvell, kind of the core part of Marvell that over time will return to a normalized run rate.\nHarsh Kumar: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tore Svanberg of Stifel. Please go ahead. \nTore Svanberg : Yes. Thank you Matt, you mentioned the NVIDIA and Marvell partnership, and I do appreciate the video on your website, but could you add a little bit more color on exactly what this means. I assume this is a multiyear partnership. But yes, any additional color you could share with us would be great? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Tore. I think yes, the video was posted today, but it really, I think, just sort of captures a very long-term working relationship between the two companies across a number of opportunities, by the way. I think we've had a complementary and very strong partnership with NVIDIA to really help enable them and their products.  In the optical area, we've been working with them for some time, and this goes back even to working with Mellanox in some of their applications. So this was really a way just to, I think, highlight the years of work we've done together and also signify that there's a lot of opportunity for us to kind of double down together on this AI opportunity. So we're proud to be a partner of them and support them in their growth. That's really what's behind it. It's not a new announcement or anything per se. It's just a recognition of a long-standing cooperation between the 2 companies.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Since that was kind of a soft question, I had a question on the enterprise networking business. It sounds like the sequential decline is going to be a little bit better than what we've seen lately. Is that a sign that you're starting to see stability there? Or are the order rates and the visibility is still very limited?\nMatt Murphy: I'd say it's still limited. I think it's still coming down. And I think we're -- we want to see when the customer balance sheets get back in shape to them talk a little bit more robustly about their end market demand, strengthening before we make a call there. So we'll have to see where enterprise IT spending really ends up, Tore, next year, given the macro. And so right now, we're just sort of taking it week by week, and we're monitoring what products they need and looking at their forecast for next year, and we're trying to plan accordingly. But I'd say visibility is pretty limited at this point for the full year.\nTore Svanberg: Great. Thank you very much. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. \nRoss Seymore : Matt, I just wanted to ask about your business and perhaps a different way to split it. I think everybody is excited about the AI and the cloud is a part of it and for good reason. But if I took that out of the revenues, everything else seems to be down in your guidance, 30%, 35% year-over-year, somewhere in that range. I really just wanted to get what percentage of that, I think, is down just because of cyclicality, and it sounds like the first quarter might come down again, but should bounce back at some point versus the businesses you are just deprioritizing. So how much of a cyclical snapback whenever that happens, should we expect out of Marvell versus a focus away from some of those non-cloud areas?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Got you, Ross. Yes, I think maybe I'll start just super fast at the high level and we'll just dive in. I'd say that this sort of supply demand inventory cycle we've gone through in the industry has taken a lot longer than historical to play out. And its sort of the dynamic I would characterize this time is you had various end markets resetting and correcting at different times in a pretty protracted manner.  And if you go all the way back to last year in 2022, it started early with PCs and what the smartphones that went to gaming and then it started with data center and cloud, and it sort of had this kind of couple year series of resets, if you will. In our business, we saw these sort of declines in that manner as you talked about earlier this year in data center as an example. And a few quarters later, it's like roaring back as we work through some of those issues. So that's the cyclicality part you're talking about. And you're asking the right question, which is, hey, over time, do these come back or not because maybe we pulled R&D or we sort of have shifted our bets. So I'd say for our business, we are committed to a diversified portfolio. We invest R&D across those various segments, including enterprise carrier. And then within the cloud, there's a number of opportunities in AI. The only one that we really have deemphasized, and this goes back 5 or 6 years ago is consumer. And we've always projected in our models, in our Analyst Days that, that would be a declining business for us over time, both in revenue as a percent of total. But then our investments in the other areas would more than offset that. And that's proven to be the case. And so I think when you think about and model us going forward, we have R&D that's going in and will continue to be invested in kind of the core base of Marvell. And we've been able to grow that very nicely over time if you look at it on a trend line. It's really the consumer piece that is not going to come back. And just to give you an example, this year, one reason it did better is one of the programs we had, which has been in last time buy mode for several quarters. It actually outperformed during the year.  Now it looks like it's not going to continue into next year. But that business is probably in like the $50 million a quarter range type of thing, and that was a design we won years and years ago, and that's just not going to repeat as an example. It's not going to come back. And that's okay because that's not something we're putting R&D into.  But for the rest of the segments, we still take a long-term view that we can grow them at or above market and then, of course, take advantage of the cloud AI opportunity, which is really the big growth driver for Marvell. Hope that's helpful.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Ramsay of TD Cowen. Please go ahead. \nMatt Ramsay : Thank you very much Good afternoon, guys. Matt, I wanted to go back to some of the custom compute and ASIC programs and maybe ask a couple of questions about that. One is, I mean it's been a heck of a year from a gen AI perspective, when you just go back 12 months, we were just starting to hear ChatGPT then the whole thing has blown up. So the customer base all had to think about that, react to that.  And so I wanted to think about the programs that you have in flight and the interactions that you have with the customers and the limited set of customers in that space that are all going to be large. Have you seen them lean more into merchant, more into using ASIC houses or more into doing some of the silicon directly with the foundries themselves? There has been a change in that mix. That's the first part of the question.  The second part is when you look at AI overall, the leader in that space, which you guys announced a partnership with today, leads not just because of the silicon, but hugely because of software. And I was curious as to whether with the custom programs you're doing for AI compute, are you seeing the customers invest at the scale and software that can make those programs successful at volume over time?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, I think it's -- you're right to kind of reflect that how much things have changed in basically a year. I think it's a pretty simple answer. On the first one, I'd say, every one of those different sort of segments, if you will, that you mentioned, all of them are up in terms of the activity. You can see it from the leaders' numbers and their guide, you can see it from some of the other companies in the ecosystem talking about ASIC and custom. I mean, look at where we've come from even on that, from having very kind of modest expectations to this being a significant revenue driver for us next year.  And then there's various business models, I think that all the large companies are trying to pursue to figure out how to, I think, do all of the above, which is kind of have a nice mix of custom for things that are very, very specific to them as well as take advantage of kind of the market unlock that's happening because of the work of, say, somebody like NVIDIA, right, that's actually helping to create a market. So I think all of that is going to be -- it's not a zero-sum game at all. And I'd say on the sort of customization side and working with those hyperscalers, the design activities through the roof at this point. And so a lot of excitement in that area, both for the custom and then all the stuff we can do around it from an optics and networking perspective. And then I'm not probably the best person to comment on the second one. But clearly, these are very, very well-capitalized smart companies. They understand their customers and they're going to do what they need to do for their workloads and for their custom silicon to make sure, I'm sure that the software and the service offerings are more than competitive, but you've got a great company that's also out there that's driving the market. So I think both are going to exist. And my last point would be to reiterate, this is clearly not like in traditional computing, where it's more of a zero-sum game. It's just highly hard to grow the pie. In fact, it may be hard to keep the pie even flat. In this area, there's going to be a lot of winners and there's going to be a lot of opportunity created for the companies that have the right positioning, customer relationship and IT portfolios to support these emerging needs. But it's very dynamic at this juncture. And I think for us, that's what creates a lot of opportunity.\nMatt Ramsay: Thanks. Appreciate the perspective. \nOperator: The next question comes from Ambrish Srivastava of BMO. Please go ahead. \nAmbrish Srivastava : Hi, thank you very much. Matt, I had a question on gross margin. You surprised us negatively early in the year, and then you gave us good counsel, don't panic. And you're back at 64%. So just wanted to think through for the next year and what's the right way to think about the gross margin profile, given you have customer is coming in, but typically is lower margin than the corporate and maybe it's not for you guys, but what's the right year to think about the margin profile for the company near to medium term Matt? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: I'll let Will take a victory lap on this one. So, Willem go ahead.\nWillem Meintjes: Yes. Ambrish, so thanks for the question. So first of all, really pleased to be guiding back to 64% at the midpoint, right? I think the team internally has done a phenomenal job controlling what we can control in a pretty volatile environment. When we look at it to next year, we've been discussing some of the uncertainty on the recovery on some of our core businesses, right, enterprise networking and storage. And then also the timing and the scale of the ramp on custom. I'll just remind you, prior to this last year, we scaled our carrier and custom business is very significantly while maintaining our gross margin, right? And so looking ahead at next year, if custom on a relative basis grow significantly more, yes, clearly, that would put pressure on our gross margin. However, our view is that they'll be very accretive on operating margin and on EPS. So yes, so that's how we're looking at it. Hopefully, that's helpful, Ambrish.\nAmbrish Srivastava: It is. I had a quick clarification for you, Matt, sorry. You mentioned something about one to one pull attach rate for your business. I was just wondering what was it before. And kind of what has changed the -- what has changed in the dynamic to push it to greater than one to one? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks, Ambrish. It's been a little bit of a journey on this topic. I think if you go back two quarters ago, we were still we were still building models out for how to think about the attach rate and help investors size the opportunity. And we ball parked it at one point one to one initially. And subsequent to that, as we sort of look at the kind of -- all of the optics through up into the switch and in the network.  And we've -- I think we've updated -- I think we were really reiterating this. We've updated this number before that it had grown to greater than 1. I think that was more of a clarification we were doing. But initially, it was a little bit of how do we actually get our hands around how big this could be and people wanted to know, balance that against how many GPUs they thought were going to shift. But I wouldn't say that's really incrementally new news. I think that was more of a reiteration, if you will, because it's not just the optics attaching from the accelerators to the switch, but also in between switch layers, and that was sort of the nuance that I think we needed to clarify. So that's the kind of rate on that one.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Please go ahead. \nHarlan Sur : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. After 6 quarters of sequential shipment declines in nearline or capacity optimized HDDs by your customers, cloud and hyperscale excess inventory of drives appears to be normalizing. And then on top of that, you have cloud storage utilizations to keep on increasing. I think your storage customers are cautiously optimistic on sequential shipment improvements on their new 20 terabyte platforms. You guys are still shipping about half the rate of your pre-slowdown run rate on storage. I know you've been growing slightly sequentially the last few quarters. But are you guys starting to see signs of a sustainable pickup in data center stores moving into next year?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Thanks. I think this is one of those markets, Harlan, where any good news is good news. I mean it's been very, very rough out there for that part of the electronics industry, and you certainly saw the impact on our revenues. Look, I'm encouraged to see the same reports of inventory coming down and some of the end customer commentary. We, I think, aren't going to call this until we really see the backlog build again. I mean it's come off the bottom and it's grown a little bit. And it's -- but even if it's sort of improving off the bottom, at least the end market side, it's still kind of flattish units, right? I don't think it's necessarily off to the races. So we're staying pretty cautious on this. We got hit pretty hard on the downside here, and we're going to cautiously kind of guide our way back into that market normalizing. But I will say the end market signs were hearing and seeing are positive, and it certainly gives us some hope for next year but we're not ready to call any kind of recovery in that area with any certainty or timing. But it has come off the bottom and it's continued to grow, which is a good thing.\nHarlan Sur: Appreciate the color. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: The next question comes from Christopher Rolland of Susquehanna. Please go ahead. \nChristopher Rolland : Hey guys, thanks for the question. I'm kind of hearing mixed signals on the custom silicon opportunity. And I just wanted you guys to clarify on that. I guess, first of all, are you guys above or below $200 million expectation you guys had for the year? Second, are you expecting this to kind of double off of that $200 million or even $600 million originally that had been an $800 million number you had discussed. And then third, where are we on that $800 million long-term goal that you had? Is that like a 2025, 2026 opportunity? Or is it something beyond that?\nMatt Murphy: Got you. Yes, you're going back to the original like 2021 Investor Day, hey, here's kind of the custom silicon opportunity, which a couple of quarters back, we had reset to $200 million this year and then over time, getting to $800 million. I just want to clarify, that's what you're asking about?\nChristopher Rolland: Yes, that's right. I think that was in March. You guys talked about that $200 million for this year.\nMatt Murphy: Yes, exactly. So yes, so we're tracking, I'd say, close to the $200 million, okay, for this year. And then what we had said at the Investor Day and kind of the long term was this $800 million, and that was between, sometime between FY '25 and '26, that was what the -- if you looked at the slide from a couple of years back. And what we had said, I think 2 quarters back or it was a quarter back that, that number would be bigger over time now because of the AI piece of it, even though some of the stuff had shifted around that wasn't an AI.  And I think that's still largely on track in that time frame. We never gave an exact kind of -- it's going to happen in XYZ quarter. But in that FY '24, '25, FY '25, '26 time frame it should be able to get towards above that number we gave before which is the $800 million. So I don't think there's any mixed signals. I don't think there's any update, which I think we're -- I think there's some enthusiasm around, but nothing's changed from a quarter ago. In fact, I think the thing that's positive is that the chips are looking really good to go to production for next year, and that was always a risk.  Chris, if you remember in our commentary was, hey, these are extremely large die, very complex and a respin either by us or by our customer would -- could cause some delay. And so far, knock on wood, both these programs look like they're in good shape. The real issue is given the sort of growth that we've seen in gen AI. We just don't know the total magnitude, but it will be bigger than what we sized before. And I think we're largely tracking to what we thought was going to happen.\nChristopher Rolland: Thank you for that Matt. One last one on carrier. Is Q4 going to be the bottom? Or do you think there could be some more yet to drop? And then I think you have some additional content coming at one of your customers at the end of the year. Is that going to be a meaningful lift for the segment? Thanks. \nMatt Murphy: Yes. So there's -- as I think I said in my remarks, there's going to be continued softness into Q1 in carrier, okay? It's going to take, who knows how many quarters. And it really depends, I think, there'll be some inventory and then you've got to also look at kind of where the CapEx ends up during next year and where carriers are actually going to spend globally on their deployments.  But over time, there is a lift. There's a content lift we get from the additional sockets. And we still don't know kind of where -- let's go a couple of years out over the next couple of years where the market share is going to go as well relative to the sort of western suppliers versus the Chinese suppliers on a global basis. So there's a few factors in there that need to be considered. But yes, over time, sort of the number of base stations per year has been relatively well understood. Our content is going to be larger. And it's a solid business for us, I think that we built from a very kind of nascent position just a few years ago. But it will come back and it will have a little tailwind because of the content.\nChristopher Rolland: Thanks so much, Matt.\nOperator: The next question comes from Srini Pajjuri of Raymond James. Please go ahead. \nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Matt, I have a couple of clarifications at this point. First, on the custom silicon, understanding that it's a little bit early to size the opportunity. Given the complexity of these chips and the supply chain issues that we've been hearing about on the HBM and the CoLo [ph] side, I would think that the lead times from your customers are fairly long. So my question is, when do you expect to start building inventory, I guess, in terms of wafer inventory and packaging and et cetera. What time frame should we kind of expect that if you, I guess, are looking to ramp next year?\nMatt Murphy: Well, the planning certainly is happening now, Srini, to your point. And I think between ourselves, our supply chain partners, and our end customers who have a vested interest to make sure this all goes well. I think we've been working quite well as a kind of a team to make sure we've got the necessary capacity that's required from our wafers packaging and kind of third-party component perspective, including HBM. And yes, I mean, all of those are either capacity that's reserved or we're in the process of starting wafers. I mean again, there's multiple programs. So it's not sort of a -- each product is at a different point. But yes, I think the answer is, well -- and I think I was saying this even a quarter or 2 ago, we'll have a lot better visibility kind of come, call it, March when -- what this is going to look like because at that point, given lead times and all the other factors we'll just have much better visibility. So that's sort of the, I guess, the pro, if you will, of some of the complexity we're dealing with is you do have to plan in advance and you do have to start wafers. So all of that is kind of in motion.  I would say the capacity planning has been done some time ago. So we feel comfortable with where we are on that, even though it's tight. But yes, we're in that process, but I don't think we're going to get that granular on when exactly we're starting wafers, and we're just going to try to size the opportunity for investors when we have a better view in terms of what the revenue is, but the capacity side is looking to be in good shape for us.\nSrini Pajjuri: That makes sense. And then my other follow-up, Matt, on your Q1 guidance. And obviously, you said half of your business is going to be down. But I would have to imagine that the data center will continue to be healthy and strong, especially kind of what your customers are talking about in terms of AI investments continuing and also NVIDIA kind of sounded fairly positive about next year as well.  So my question is, given the strength that you saw in the last 2 quarters, I mean, are you concerned about any inventory build in your components? Or is that what's giving you pause about guiding for growth in the first quarter for the overall business? Because even if 50% of the business is down because looking at how much this business has grown in the last 2 quarters and if that trend continues, I would have to imagine that the total revenue should grow in Q1. So I'm just wondering what's giving you that pause looking for growth in Q1.\nMatt Murphy: Yes, yes. No, no problem. I'll maybe give you a little bit of a bad time here. I think we're trying to get to the Q4 call first. And then we could do the Q1 call, okay? So maybe first things first. So that being said, I mean, look, I think I would agree with the market commentary you gave, which is year-over-year, we do expect strong growth.  I'd say on our side, if you look at kind of the growth we've seen on AI, we're having a very, very strong fourth quarter. And some of that we're catching up from the upsides we had. I mean our supply chain team has done a phenomenal job, right? So I'd just say that we're not guiding Q1, it's dynamic at this point. And I need to really see where the orders flow in and what people really need. And right now, we're just focused on executing Q4. But yes, overall demand looks good. Overall growth next year should be good. But I think trying to guide 2 quarters now with this precision, Srini, is just not going to be helpful for anybody given how fast things are moving. So I'd prefer to give you my Q1 guide when we guide Q1.\nSrini Pajjuri: Got it. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Chris Caso of Wolfe.\nChris Caso : Yes, thank you. My question is on the cloud part of data center. It sounds like that was an area which may have surprised you a little bit coming back here. Can you talk about the driver of that? And to what extent -- to the extent you're seeing in kind of traditional cloud business is it cyclical or product cycle-driven?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, thanks. Our thesis earlier this year, which actually did play out, I think we had a lot of predictions and in some cases, the market didn't cooperate. But one area it did was that we did not believe that our traditional cloud business was going to be really impacted by the shift to AI. And in fact, it might even provide a tailwind. And our position was that, hey, because of our position in switching and in optics, that broader networking build was going to be required in data centers, in particular, multi-tenant data centers where you had to actually put in increased networking bandwidth to handle the AI capability that was being put in and that's played out. So I'd say there's been some on the product cycle in terms of new products kicking in at that time. But also, I'd just say that it's increased demand, increased demand for products, we added 400 gig and increased demand for our 12.8T switches, things that had been a little bit depressed earlier in the year with inventory correction. So that's been a real positive. It's kind of a nice combination of strong growth on the products we have as well as new products wrapping up -- ramping up, sorry. So yes, and that's played out, and that should be a nice driver and tailwind for us into next year as well. Chris.\nChris Caso: Got it. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: All right, fantastic. Hey, listen, I think we're pretty much at time. I'm going to conclude the call, maybe just a few words. First, I appreciate everybody's interest in the company. A couple of final comments would be despite kind of the challenging macro out there, I'm very, very pleased with the Marvell team and our performance. And I think what it shows is that even when you have a lot of volatility from a cyclical perspective in some of these end markets, right now, it's enterprise and carrier as an example, the diversified business model that we've really put together at Marvell has been able to have some strong offsets to those things. And like right now, we're seeing our data center business come roaring back with strong growth in the third quarter and then a very, very strong growth in the fourth quarter.  And that's the commitment we made several years ago. It was to diversify the company by end market, focus on data infrastructure, which, in our view, is going to be probably the best TAM growth opportunity in semis. And we still believe that and while we have some inventory digestion and end market weakness we're seeing in some segments that's going to revert over time in enterprise and carrier. And I would view that as, and describe that as kind of the core foundation of Marvell.  And then you have these nice growth drivers with large TAMs on top of it in cloud, in AI, in things like automotive that are going to drive our growth over time. So I think our model is working, and we're managing in a tough environment, and we're managing what we can control at this point. And with that, I will conclude the meeting. Thanks, everybody.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation, and you may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Willem Meintjes",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue in the third quarter was $1.49 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, declining 8% year-over-year and growing 6% sequentially. Data center was our largest end market driving 39% of total revenue. The next largest was carrier infrastructure with 22%, followed by enterprise networking at 19%, consumer at 12% and auto industrial at 8%. GAAP gross margin was 38.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.6%, growing 30 basis points sequentially, driven by higher revenue and cost improvements. Moving on to operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses were $698 million, including stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $437 million, in line with our guidance. GAAP operating margin was negative 10.3%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 29.8%. For the third quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.19. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.41, $0.01 above the midpoint of guidance. Now turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. Cash flow from operations in the third quarter was $503 million, which grew by $391 million sequentially. This significant growth was driven by our relative improvement in DSO, lower inventory along with better profitability. Our inventory at the end of the third quarter was $942 million decreasing by $74 million from the prior quarter. Our DSO was 78 days, reducing by 4 days from the prior quarter. Our CapEx was $54 million. We returned $52 million to shareholders through cash dividends and we repurchased $50 million of our stock during the third quarter. Our total debt was $4.19 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 2.21 times and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.83 times.  During the quarter, we issued new bonds and used the proceeds to pay down our upcoming debt maturities. With our investment-grade credit rating, we were able to execute this refinancing while decreasing our average interest rate on our outstanding debt balance. In addition, we increased our average debt maturity from 3.9 years to 5.3 years. As of the end of the third fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $726 million increasing by $202 million from the prior quarter. Turning to our guidance for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.42 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 48.2% to 50.7%. We expect our non-GAAP gross margin to be in the range of 63.5% to 64.5%, with the midpoint projected to be back to the low end of our long-term target model. Our forecast for this large sequential improvement is driven by expectations of a significantly stronger product mix and our ongoing cost optimization activities. Looking forward, we expect that product mix as well as the overall level of revenue will remain key determinants of our gross margin in any given quarter. For the fourth quarter, we project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $680 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately $430 million. This level of operating expense reflects the completion of the cost reduction plan we communicated in our first fiscal quarter of this year. Looking ahead to the first quarter of fiscal 2025, we anticipate typical seasonality in payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases. As a result, we expect OpEx to increase by mid- to high single digits on a percentage basis. For the fourth quarter, we expect other income and expense, including interest on our debt to be approximately $50 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate of 6% for the fourth quarter, increasing to 7% in fiscal 2025. We expect our basic average shares outstanding to be 865 million and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be $874 million. We anticipate GAAP earnings per diluted share in the range of a loss of $0.08 to a gain of $0.02 per share. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.41 to $0.51. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. Yes. Ambrish, so thanks for the question. So first of all, really pleased to be guiding back to 64% at the midpoint, right? I think the team internally has done a phenomenal job controlling what we can control in a pretty volatile environment. When we look at it to next year, we've been discussing some of the uncertainty on the recovery on some of our core businesses, right, enterprise networking and storage. And then also the timing and the scale of the ramp on custom. I'll just remind you, prior to this last year, we scaled our carrier and custom business is very significantly while maintaining our gross margin, right? And so looking ahead at next year, if custom on a relative basis grow significantly more, yes, clearly, that would put pressure on our gross margin. However, our view is that they'll be very accretive on operating margin and on EPS. So yes, so that's how we're looking at it. Hopefully, that's helpful, Ambrish."

            "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. For the third quarter of fiscal 2024, Marvell delivered revenue of $1.42 billion, growing 6% sequentially above the midpoint of guidance. In addition, on a non-GAAP basis, the Marvell team drove a sequential increase in gross margin, remain disciplined on operating expenses and delivered EPS of $0.41, above the midpoint of our guidance. We are pleased with our results in execution.  In our data center end market, revenue for the third quarter was $556 million, well above our guidance, driven by stronger than forecasted AI revenue. We are also encouraged by revenue from cloud, returning to year-over-year growth. On a sequential basis, overall data center revenue grew 21% in the third quarter, while cloud grew well in excess of 30%.  As expected revenue from the enterprise on-premise portion of our data center end market declined sequentially in the third quarter, reflecting weakening demand. Demand for data center storage also remains depressed, and industry expectations for recovery have continued to push out.  In cloud, revenue from both AI and standard cloud infrastructure grew sequentially, with AI growing significantly faster. Growth was broad based led by our PAM4 optical products. Teralynx Ethernet switches, as well as our data center interconnect, or DCI products.  Earlier today, we released a video highlighting our long standing collaboration with NVIDIA, where using Marvell's optical interconnect technology to enable the bandwidth scale and reliability required by Generative AI. Marvell has built a broad product portfolio which are customers are relying upon to power their accelerated computing infrastructure. We are benefiting from strong demand for 800-gig PAM electro-optic products, tightly correlated to the growth of in deployment of AI accelerators. In fact, we are seeing the overall attach rate of our PAM products to accelerators being higher than one to one in high performance AI systems currently shipping in the market.  We're also seeing strong customer traction for our next generation 1.6T 200-gig per lane PAM platform, that we started sampling this past April. Customer qualifications have begun and we are looking forward to ramping our 1.6T solution into production. Complementing our optical solutions, we expect our PAM DSPs for the active electrical cable, or AEC market to start ramping in our next fiscal year in Tier 1 cloud deployments. We also demonstrated our 224 gigabits per second, long-reach SerDes at the OCP Global Summit held in October. We expect that this technology will serve as a building block for our next generation 200-gig per lane AECs.  In our switching portfolio, we are making great progress on our next generation 51.2T cloud switching platform. At OCP, we demonstrated Marvell's 51.2T solution, operating at full capacity with very low industry leading latency running on SONiC. Our enabled Meta SONiC and agile open source network operating system is very important for cloud customers who value the flexibility, interoperability and scalability of an open Ethernet switch ecosystem. Customers have started development on our 51.2T solution, and we look forward to ramping this platform into production.  In addition, earlier this week, we announced our membership in the Ultra Ethernet Consortium. This is another step in our commitment to driving continuous innovation on an open Ethernet based cloud fabric, which can deliver the scale and performance required for next generation workloads including generative AI.  As our 400 gig DCI modules continue to ramp, we're also seeing strong interest for our next generation 800 gig products that we launched this past October. These modules are based on our new 5-nanometer 800 gig coherent DSP and silicon photonics, or SiPho platform, which integrates multiple discrete components within a single device. This level of integration enables the performance and packaging density required for small form factor pluggable modules to grab a high bandwidth signal across long distances between data centers. Marvell's SiPho platform has accumulated billions of operating hours over the past seven years in DCI applications.  In addition, we are starting to see emerging applications for our field proven SiPho technology to power next generation higher bandwidth and optical connections inside data centers. We look forward to updating investors as this opportunity unfolds over time.  Cloud customers remain focused on enhancing their AI offerings by building custom compute solutions of their own, and we have already won a number of these designs. We have completed qualification of 1 key AI project and have started wafers under production. For another project, we have received first silicon back from the fab and the initial testing is looking positive. As a result, we expect both of these custom compute programs to start volume production next year. Turning now to our guidance for overall data center end market. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenue from our data center end market to grow in the mid-30% range on a sequential basis. In our last earnings call, we provided a forecast for AI revenue to cross a $200 million quarterly run rate exiting this year. Since then, demand has continued to grow, and we now expect our AI revenue in the fourth quarter to come in significantly above our forecast.  In addition to strong growth from AI, we also expect revenue from standard cloud infrastructure to grow sequentially in the fourth quarter. For the enterprise on-premise portion of our data center end market, we expect revenue to decline sequentially in the fourth quarter. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $317 million, above guidance growing 17% year-over-year and 15% sequentially. The overachievement in the third quarter was driven entirely by the wireless portion of our carrier end market. Marvell specific product cycles have enabled our wireless revenue to buck the trend of a soft end market for several quarters. However, we have been forecasting for some time that this wave of above-market wireless growth for Marvell would start to decline by the fourth quarter as the initial wave of 5G rollout completion.  Additionally, demand is continuing to soften as carriers are managing CapEx in a difficult macroeconomic environment. As a result, following an extended multiyear period of strong growth, we are expecting a period of digestion. In addition, we expect revenue from the wired portion of our carrier end markets to continue to decline, reflecting weakening demand. As a result, for the fourth quarter, we expect revenue from our overall carrier end market to decline in the mid-40% range on a sequential basis. Looking longer term as data traffic continues to grow, we expect that operators will need to continue to invest in adding capacity in both the wireless and wired end markets. We also expect to benefit from share gains, including significant 5-nanometer base station design wins, which we have won but are not in production. We are optimistic that carrier CapEx will normalize over time, and our revenue from this end market will return to growth. Turning to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $271 million, declining 28% year-over-year and 17% sequentially. As we have been signaling, we see weak demand in this end market. As a result, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we project enterprise networking revenue to decline in the mid-single digits sequentially on a percentage basis.  Turning to our automotive and industrial end markets. Revenue in the third quarter was $107 million, growing 26% year-over-year and declining 3% sequentially. Looking to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, we expect revenue from our overall auto and industrial end market to decline by approximately 20% on a sequential basis. We expect the sequential decline to come from our industrial end market, which includes aerospace and defense, where order patterns can be lumpy in any given quarter. Moving on to our consumer end market. Revenue for the third quarter was $169 million, declining 5% year-over and growing 1% sequentially. In the fourth quarter, we are expecting revenue from the consumer end market to sequentially decline in the mid-teens on a percentage basis. In summary, we delivered revenue and non-GAAP earnings above the midpoint of guidance for the fiscal third quarter. The diversification in our end markets is serving us well with strong growth from AI and cloud carrying us through a softening demand environment across other end markets.  Through fiscal 2024, the Marvell team has continued to execute in a dynamic environment, remaining focused on driving continuous improvement on what we can control while dealing with inventory corrections and macroeconomic-induced demand headwinds in many end markets.  We reprioritized our investments to align to the highest ROI opportunities in front of us. Our team drove efficiency improvements to reduce operating expenses, and we are well on track to meet our commitment. We've worked proactively with our customers and suppliers to best manage inventory across the combined supply chain. Our operations group has rapidly responded to the increase in demand from AI. At the midpoint of our guidance for the fourth quarter, we are forecasting that our revenue for the second half of this fiscal year should grow approximately 7% over the first half. In addition, we are forecasting a 300-plus basis point sequential improvement in our non-GAAP gross margin in the fourth quarter. This projection reflects our expectation for an improving product mix as well as a multi-quarter cross-functional effort to further optimize our cost structure. Heading into next year, while we don't typically guide beyond a quarter, we expect softness in demand to impact revenue from our enterprise and carrier markets in the first quarter. We also anticipate a significant reduction in consumer end market revenue due to seasonality in demand and the completion of deliveries for an end-of-life program in the fourth quarter. Although the enterprise and carrier markets are experiencing near-term headwinds, these large and long-lasting end markets are critical to the global economy. So we expect them to recover and turn into our revenue tailwind over time. In the meantime, our data center revenue is growing rapidly, reflecting our emergence as a key enabler of accelerated computing. We project data center revenue, driven by the ongoing strength in our connectivity solutions inside and between data centers to grow to over 50% of our total revenue in the fourth quarter. Longer term, we expect additional tailwinds to data center growth from the ramp of multiple custom accelerated compute programs for AI. We are also looking forward to a number of new Marvell products entering the data center market, as I discussed earlier. With that, I'll turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Yes. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. We're very pleased with the performance of our data center business grew over 20%. In Q3, we're guiding it up 35%, in Q4, as you noted, that is driven by AI and the Q4 exit rate is well north now of $200 million. What's very encouraging as well is that the traditional cloud infrastructure piece of it is also growing nicely. That's come back very strong for us. And those two will be growth drivers for us into next year. We see continued weakness in softness, and this is a broader market statement than the on-premise piece and that probably persists for some time, but the mix now of cloud and AI is so much higher that it's driving the overall segment in a very positive trajectory, both in the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. And then as we head into next year, as you've seen, most of the strong growth we saw in the current fiscal year in AI and cloud infra for that matter has been in the optics area, but we are tracking well for growth their next year as well as the ramp of our custom silicon programs. And in my prepared remarks, I talked about the strong progress we made on new product development and starting to plan for ramps there.  So while we're not resizing those specifically, those -- the performance clearly in the fourth quarter as well as what you would how you think about next year is much, much stronger than when we first signaled the AI opportunity for Marvell a couple of quarters back. So I think things are tracking nicely. And as you said, compared to 90 days ago, I think the overall aggregate data center business, as you can see from our results, is doing quite well. Yes. Thanks, Tim, and appreciate the creativity on the 2-parter, but no problem. On the enterprise side, it's hard to comment. I mean if you look, balance sheets are still pretty heavy from the OEMs out there. We've been saying, I think since even going back to December of last year that enterprise was going to come down this year and it's just continued to come down. I think there's a combination of both inventory management at the OEM level as well as from some of the projections you see out there at the end market level, a softer and more weakening demand environment.  So we still feel very good about our position. We had grown this business significantly from where it was just a few years ago. We had great years the last couple of years and even in the first half of this year. So we're going through what would be kind of a normal inventory correction cycle. It's taking a little bit longer than we thought if you went back to the beginning of the year, but I also think the macro and the environment has deteriorated more than we would have anticipated at that time. And so we see it down, and we see that having to work through that issue for the next couple of quarters. On Q1, while we don't guide specifically, I understand what you're looking for. I think the way to think about it is that, and I guess I gave the information. Carrier is down after a really great run in Q4, that's going to stay weak. The telco environment and CapEx spending is very constrained out there and the end customers seem to be having some trouble. We talked about enterprise being down. And then on consumer, which actually did a little bit better than we thought it would have this year. The last time buy program that we had has been largely going to conclude now in the fourth quarter, and so we see a stepping down there. So, if you kind of add all that up, that's about half our revenue that's going to come down in Q1. And then the real question is the data center strength and how does that continue? And it's too early to call, but just the way to think about it is it's a lot to offset at this juncture when you have that much of your revenue coming down.  The last thing I would say, though, on carrier and enterprise is that these are -- this is a cyclical downturn on these and the kind of design win strength we've had in the design position we had is such that these will recover, and they will come back to a normalized run rate over time. And when that happens, that will be a tailwind to EPS and a tailwind to revenue growth as that kind of think of it as the base business of Marvell returns to growth.  And in the meantime, our diversified strategy is working well because we've got AI and cloud that's really firing on all cylinders. So a lot of information there. You guys are going to have to up with your own model, but hopefully, that gave you some pieces on how to think about it. Yes. Thanks, Vivek. I think a couple of ways to think about it. The first is on the customer opportunity, just by design, it's highly concentrated, if you think about it. And there's just a handful of companies that can really drive the kind of silicon TAM opportunity that that's out there. And you've probably seen in the last few weeks, there's just been a tremendous number of announcements across the industry around AI, whether it's strategic partnerships that are being announced, people doing their own silicon, behind that, their own silicon. There's typically partners there, people like Marvell, who are going to participate. So a lot of activity, you can see and I would say even one broader statement, then I'll get to your question.  We do see as the TAM is moving from traditional computing architectures to accelerated computing, it is really opening up the custom silicon piece of that. And so that we believe will be a larger portion of the TAM going forward. When we talked about sizing, if you remember, a couple of quarters back, our AI opportunity, we had signaled already that this year, we would do about $400 million on the optical area. Well, said another way, we do about $400 million this year in total AI revenue, most of it driven by optics and that next year would be about $800 million. That was the original sort of bogey we put out to help investors to your point, size this. And then you would assume some optics growth, and so you could sort of do the math on what the difference might be.  Now AI's got a bigger head of steam than it was back then. The optics piece is higher and we've made significant progress now on new product development in terms of getting the chips actually taped out and through the fab and now starting to think about ramping. But what I would say is, and I've been saying this to investors for about 6 months, we are not in a position to call the ball just yet on how big the custom silicon opportunity can be for next year. It's still early, Vivek. I understand the investor appetite for this.  I would say between us and our customers, we're not fully -- we don't fully know how big this can be yet. So I'm going to need a little bit more time to probably size that for you. But what I can say is from when we first talked about AI 2 quarters back and what the opportunity was looking out to next year, it's much, much higher. And that's both on the custom side as well as on the optic side. So I hope that helps. I understand the question, but it's a pretty dynamic market as you see what's going on. But the good news is it's all moving in a very positive and upward direction. Yes. Thanks, Harsh. And it is a choppy environment, as you point out. Look, I think on carrier, we're coming off a very, very strong Q3. It was over $300 million. And I think if you just kind of infer the whole year, it's going to be -- have been like a $1 billion business for Marvell. So I think that's been a success story for us. Clearly, some -- and we've been trying to signal if you go back over the last couple of calls, we've attempted to signal to investors the fourth quarter that there would be -- that sort of the third quarter would be the peak of 5G stuff, and then it would take some time for that to judge that through. And we bucked the trend, if you remember, on our performance here. So both of those are -- that carrier segment is a strong segment for Marvell. It will return over time, back to a normalized run rate, but it's very lumpy and volatile as carrier usually is. What I would say on the timing, I think they're both going to come back. It's just -- it's hard to know exactly when on these. I think the predictability in the segment is tough. So I don't think I have an exact answer on which one comes back sooner. I'd say wire has been trending down for some time as I think some of that pandemic led infrastructure build has waned. The carrier 5G stuff has really performed extremely well for us this year.  And by the way, when it does come back, both on the carrier on the wireless and wired side, we have incremental design wins in those segments. One is incremental content base stations with the Layer 2 processor opportunity and also our new 800-gig DSPs for carrier -- for wired infrastructure, those are going to be new revenue drivers for us when we come back out of this. So timing is still unknown. But I would just say that this is a part of the base business of Marvell, kind of the core part of Marvell that over time will return to a normalized run rate. Yes. Thanks, Tore. I think yes, the video was posted today, but it really, I think, just sort of captures a very long-term working relationship between the two companies across a number of opportunities, by the way. I think we've had a complementary and very strong partnership with NVIDIA to really help enable them and their products.  In the optical area, we've been working with them for some time, and this goes back even to working with Mellanox in some of their applications. So this was really a way just to, I think, highlight the years of work we've done together and also signify that there's a lot of opportunity for us to kind of double down together on this AI opportunity. So we're proud to be a partner of them and support them in their growth. That's really what's behind it. It's not a new announcement or anything per se. It's just a recognition of a long-standing cooperation between the 2 companies. I'd say it's still limited. I think it's still coming down. And I think we're -- we want to see when the customer balance sheets get back in shape to them talk a little bit more robustly about their end market demand, strengthening before we make a call there. So we'll have to see where enterprise IT spending really ends up, Tore, next year, given the macro. And so right now, we're just sort of taking it week by week, and we're monitoring what products they need and looking at their forecast for next year, and we're trying to plan accordingly. But I'd say visibility is pretty limited at this point for the full year. Yes. Got you, Ross. Yes, I think maybe I'll start just super fast at the high level and we'll just dive in. I'd say that this sort of supply demand inventory cycle we've gone through in the industry has taken a lot longer than historical to play out. And its sort of the dynamic I would characterize this time is you had various end markets resetting and correcting at different times in a pretty protracted manner.  And if you go all the way back to last year in 2022, it started early with PCs and what the smartphones that went to gaming and then it started with data center and cloud, and it sort of had this kind of couple year series of resets, if you will. In our business, we saw these sort of declines in that manner as you talked about earlier this year in data center as an example. And a few quarters later, it's like roaring back as we work through some of those issues. So that's the cyclicality part you're talking about. And you're asking the right question, which is, hey, over time, do these come back or not because maybe we pulled R&D or we sort of have shifted our bets. So I'd say for our business, we are committed to a diversified portfolio. We invest R&D across those various segments, including enterprise carrier. And then within the cloud, there's a number of opportunities in AI. The only one that we really have deemphasized, and this goes back 5 or 6 years ago is consumer. And we've always projected in our models, in our Analyst Days that, that would be a declining business for us over time, both in revenue as a percent of total. But then our investments in the other areas would more than offset that. And that's proven to be the case. And so I think when you think about and model us going forward, we have R&D that's going in and will continue to be invested in kind of the core base of Marvell. And we've been able to grow that very nicely over time if you look at it on a trend line. It's really the consumer piece that is not going to come back. And just to give you an example, this year, one reason it did better is one of the programs we had, which has been in last time buy mode for several quarters. It actually outperformed during the year.  Now it looks like it's not going to continue into next year. But that business is probably in like the $50 million a quarter range type of thing, and that was a design we won years and years ago, and that's just not going to repeat as an example. It's not going to come back. And that's okay because that's not something we're putting R&D into.  But for the rest of the segments, we still take a long-term view that we can grow them at or above market and then, of course, take advantage of the cloud AI opportunity, which is really the big growth driver for Marvell. Hope that's helpful. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Yes, I think it's -- you're right to kind of reflect that how much things have changed in basically a year. I think it's a pretty simple answer. On the first one, I'd say, every one of those different sort of segments, if you will, that you mentioned, all of them are up in terms of the activity. You can see it from the leaders' numbers and their guide, you can see it from some of the other companies in the ecosystem talking about ASIC and custom. I mean, look at where we've come from even on that, from having very kind of modest expectations to this being a significant revenue driver for us next year.  And then there's various business models, I think that all the large companies are trying to pursue to figure out how to, I think, do all of the above, which is kind of have a nice mix of custom for things that are very, very specific to them as well as take advantage of kind of the market unlock that's happening because of the work of, say, somebody like NVIDIA, right, that's actually helping to create a market. So I think all of that is going to be -- it's not a zero-sum game at all. And I'd say on the sort of customization side and working with those hyperscalers, the design activities through the roof at this point. And so a lot of excitement in that area, both for the custom and then all the stuff we can do around it from an optics and networking perspective. And then I'm not probably the best person to comment on the second one. But clearly, these are very, very well-capitalized smart companies. They understand their customers and they're going to do what they need to do for their workloads and for their custom silicon to make sure, I'm sure that the software and the service offerings are more than competitive, but you've got a great company that's also out there that's driving the market. So I think both are going to exist. And my last point would be to reiterate, this is clearly not like in traditional computing, where it's more of a zero-sum game. It's just highly hard to grow the pie. In fact, it may be hard to keep the pie even flat. In this area, there's going to be a lot of winners and there's going to be a lot of opportunity created for the companies that have the right positioning, customer relationship and IT portfolios to support these emerging needs. But it's very dynamic at this juncture. And I think for us, that's what creates a lot of opportunity. I'll let Will take a victory lap on this one. So, Willem go ahead. Yes. Thanks, Ambrish. It's been a little bit of a journey on this topic. I think if you go back two quarters ago, we were still we were still building models out for how to think about the attach rate and help investors size the opportunity. And we ball parked it at one point one to one initially. And subsequent to that, as we sort of look at the kind of -- all of the optics through up into the switch and in the network.  And we've -- I think we've updated -- I think we were really reiterating this. We've updated this number before that it had grown to greater than 1. I think that was more of a clarification we were doing. But initially, it was a little bit of how do we actually get our hands around how big this could be and people wanted to know, balance that against how many GPUs they thought were going to shift. But I wouldn't say that's really incrementally new news. I think that was more of a reiteration, if you will, because it's not just the optics attaching from the accelerators to the switch, but also in between switch layers, and that was sort of the nuance that I think we needed to clarify. So that's the kind of rate on that one. Yes. Thanks. I think this is one of those markets, Harlan, where any good news is good news. I mean it's been very, very rough out there for that part of the electronics industry, and you certainly saw the impact on our revenues. Look, I'm encouraged to see the same reports of inventory coming down and some of the end customer commentary. We, I think, aren't going to call this until we really see the backlog build again. I mean it's come off the bottom and it's grown a little bit. And it's -- but even if it's sort of improving off the bottom, at least the end market side, it's still kind of flattish units, right? I don't think it's necessarily off to the races. So we're staying pretty cautious on this. We got hit pretty hard on the downside here, and we're going to cautiously kind of guide our way back into that market normalizing. But I will say the end market signs were hearing and seeing are positive, and it certainly gives us some hope for next year but we're not ready to call any kind of recovery in that area with any certainty or timing. But it has come off the bottom and it's continued to grow, which is a good thing. Got you. Yes, you're going back to the original like 2021 Investor Day, hey, here's kind of the custom silicon opportunity, which a couple of quarters back, we had reset to $200 million this year and then over time, getting to $800 million. I just want to clarify, that's what you're asking about? Yes, exactly. So yes, so we're tracking, I'd say, close to the $200 million, okay, for this year. And then what we had said at the Investor Day and kind of the long term was this $800 million, and that was between, sometime between FY '25 and '26, that was what the -- if you looked at the slide from a couple of years back. And what we had said, I think 2 quarters back or it was a quarter back that, that number would be bigger over time now because of the AI piece of it, even though some of the stuff had shifted around that wasn't an AI.  And I think that's still largely on track in that time frame. We never gave an exact kind of -- it's going to happen in XYZ quarter. But in that FY '24, '25, FY '25, '26 time frame it should be able to get towards above that number we gave before which is the $800 million. So I don't think there's any mixed signals. I don't think there's any update, which I think we're -- I think there's some enthusiasm around, but nothing's changed from a quarter ago. In fact, I think the thing that's positive is that the chips are looking really good to go to production for next year, and that was always a risk.  Chris, if you remember in our commentary was, hey, these are extremely large die, very complex and a respin either by us or by our customer would -- could cause some delay. And so far, knock on wood, both these programs look like they're in good shape. The real issue is given the sort of growth that we've seen in gen AI. We just don't know the total magnitude, but it will be bigger than what we sized before. And I think we're largely tracking to what we thought was going to happen. Yes. So there's -- as I think I said in my remarks, there's going to be continued softness into Q1 in carrier, okay? It's going to take, who knows how many quarters. And it really depends, I think, there'll be some inventory and then you've got to also look at kind of where the CapEx ends up during next year and where carriers are actually going to spend globally on their deployments.  But over time, there is a lift. There's a content lift we get from the additional sockets. And we still don't know kind of where -- let's go a couple of years out over the next couple of years where the market share is going to go as well relative to the sort of western suppliers versus the Chinese suppliers on a global basis. So there's a few factors in there that need to be considered. But yes, over time, sort of the number of base stations per year has been relatively well understood. Our content is going to be larger. And it's a solid business for us, I think that we built from a very kind of nascent position just a few years ago. But it will come back and it will have a little tailwind because of the content. Well, the planning certainly is happening now, Srini, to your point. And I think between ourselves, our supply chain partners, and our end customers who have a vested interest to make sure this all goes well. I think we've been working quite well as a kind of a team to make sure we've got the necessary capacity that's required from our wafers packaging and kind of third-party component perspective, including HBM. And yes, I mean, all of those are either capacity that's reserved or we're in the process of starting wafers. I mean again, there's multiple programs. So it's not sort of a -- each product is at a different point. But yes, I think the answer is, well -- and I think I was saying this even a quarter or 2 ago, we'll have a lot better visibility kind of come, call it, March when -- what this is going to look like because at that point, given lead times and all the other factors we'll just have much better visibility. So that's sort of the, I guess, the pro, if you will, of some of the complexity we're dealing with is you do have to plan in advance and you do have to start wafers. So all of that is kind of in motion.  I would say the capacity planning has been done some time ago. So we feel comfortable with where we are on that, even though it's tight. But yes, we're in that process, but I don't think we're going to get that granular on when exactly we're starting wafers, and we're just going to try to size the opportunity for investors when we have a better view in terms of what the revenue is, but the capacity side is looking to be in good shape for us. Yes, yes. No, no problem. I'll maybe give you a little bit of a bad time here. I think we're trying to get to the Q4 call first. And then we could do the Q1 call, okay? So maybe first things first. So that being said, I mean, look, I think I would agree with the market commentary you gave, which is year-over-year, we do expect strong growth.  I'd say on our side, if you look at kind of the growth we've seen on AI, we're having a very, very strong fourth quarter. And some of that we're catching up from the upsides we had. I mean our supply chain team has done a phenomenal job, right? So I'd just say that we're not guiding Q1, it's dynamic at this point. And I need to really see where the orders flow in and what people really need. And right now, we're just focused on executing Q4. But yes, overall demand looks good. Overall growth next year should be good. But I think trying to guide 2 quarters now with this precision, Srini, is just not going to be helpful for anybody given how fast things are moving. So I'd prefer to give you my Q1 guide when we guide Q1. Yes, thanks. Our thesis earlier this year, which actually did play out, I think we had a lot of predictions and in some cases, the market didn't cooperate. But one area it did was that we did not believe that our traditional cloud business was going to be really impacted by the shift to AI. And in fact, it might even provide a tailwind. And our position was that, hey, because of our position in switching and in optics, that broader networking build was going to be required in data centers, in particular, multi-tenant data centers where you had to actually put in increased networking bandwidth to handle the AI capability that was being put in and that's played out. So I'd say there's been some on the product cycle in terms of new products kicking in at that time. But also, I'd just say that it's increased demand, increased demand for products, we added 400 gig and increased demand for our 12.8T switches, things that had been a little bit depressed earlier in the year with inventory correction. So that's been a real positive. It's kind of a nice combination of strong growth on the products we have as well as new products wrapping up -- ramping up, sorry. So yes, and that's played out, and that should be a nice driver and tailwind for us into next year as well. Chris. All right, fantastic. Hey, listen, I think we're pretty much at time. I'm going to conclude the call, maybe just a few words. First, I appreciate everybody's interest in the company. A couple of final comments would be despite kind of the challenging macro out there, I'm very, very pleased with the Marvell team and our performance. And I think what it shows is that even when you have a lot of volatility from a cyclical perspective in some of these end markets, right now, it's enterprise and carrier as an example, the diversified business model that we've really put together at Marvell has been able to have some strong offsets to those things. And like right now, we're seeing our data center business come roaring back with strong growth in the third quarter and then a very, very strong growth in the fourth quarter.  And that's the commitment we made several years ago. It was to diversify the company by end market, focus on data infrastructure, which, in our view, is going to be probably the best TAM growth opportunity in semis. And we still believe that and while we have some inventory digestion and end market weakness we're seeing in some segments that's going to revert over time in enterprise and carrier. And I would view that as, and describe that as kind of the core foundation of Marvell.  And then you have these nice growth drivers with large TAMs on top of it in cloud, in AI, in things like automotive that are going to drive our growth over time. So I think our model is working, and we're managing in a tough environment, and we're managing what we can control at this point. And with that, I will conclude the meeting. Thanks, everybody."

All participants will be in listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn this conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon, everyone. Welcome to Marvell's second fiscal quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's Chairman and CEO; and Willem Meintjes, our CFO. Let me remind everyone that certain comments made today include forward-looking statements which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. Before I turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance, let me highlight several new product announcements, starting with our electro-optics portfolio. First, we announced the release of Orion, the industry's first 800-gig coherent optical DSP for pluggable modules. Orion is our fifth generation of coherent DSPs and is produced in 5-nanometer technology incorporating our 112-gig SerDes, enabling 800-gigabits per second of throughput within the tight power and space constraints of small form factor pluggable optical modules. Orion enables high-performance probabilistic traffic shaping in addition to supporting standards-compliant transmission modes. We expect that Orion is well-positioned to continue to drive Marvell's leadership in coherent technology in both the carrier optical transport market as well as data center interconnects, or DCI, in the cloud market. In parallel with Orion, we launched the industry's first 800-gig DCI ZR module, our COLORZ 800 platform. We will be demonstrating our 800ZR module at the ECOC Conference in October. Marvell pioneered DCI technology at 100-gig, followed by a 400ZR platform, which has been shipping in volume since last year. COLORZ 800 will be our third generation of DCI modules. Powered by our new Orion DSP, COLORZ 800 incorporates Marvell's innovative silicon photonics technology, which integrates multiple discrete components on a single die. Marvell's 800ZR modules provide twice the bandwidth of current solutions while lowering power and cost per bit by 30%. Our 800ZR modules will enable the deployment of next-generation 51.2T switches and routers by cloud operators to support the massive increase in traffic between data centers, driven by continuing growth from Generative AI. Moving to our copper connectivity portfolio, we announced the industry's first 5-nanometer multi-gigabit PHY platform. This platform represents a significant leap in performance compared to products on the market today and is a key milestone in Marvell's journey to physical layer technology leadership. It is based on an innovative architecture that includes optimized circuit design, custom digital logic, and enhanced DSP algorithms. This PHY platform will deliver 10-gig performance at half the power of previous generation Marvell devices and will become the building blocks for multiple standalone PHY products, integrated SoCs, and custom ASICs optimized for specific markets and applications. We expect the adoption of multi-gig PHY will continue to grow in enterprise networking. In our automotive end market, we announced the industry's highest capacity automotive central Ethernet switch to support the zonal networking architectures of next-generation vehicles. This addition to our Brightlane family of auto Ethernet switches delivers 90-gigabits per second of bandwidth, nearly 2 times higher than current commercially available solutions. The new switch family also includes a combination of advanced security features not found together in any other automotive switch product. These features include MACsec link security on every port, deep packet inspection for heightened intrusion detection, and an embedded hardware security module for encryption. This product has started sampling to multiple leading automotive customers and partners. Let me now turn the call over to Matt for his comments on the quarter. Matt?\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Marvell team continued to execute, delivering revenue of $1.34 billion. These results were above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily driven by demand from AI applications growing faster than our prior forecast. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were better than guidance due to an acceleration of the cost reduction plan we outlined last quarter. As a result, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.33, $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. We are pleased with our performance for the quarter in a challenging macro environment. Let me now move on to reviewing our results and expectations by end market, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the second quarter was $460 million, growing 6% sequentially, well above our guidance for a flat outlook. We were able to outperform our guidance in this end market because of accelerating demand for optical products to meet the continuing expansion of cloud AI deployments. Our overall revenue from cloud grew over 20% sequentially. Notably, revenue from both cloud AI and standard cloud infrastructure grew sequentially, with AI growing faster. As expected, revenue from the enterprise on-premise portion of our data center end market declined significantly on a sequential basis in the second quarter, reflecting a weakening enterprise market. As you heard in detail last quarter, AI infrastructure requires a staggering amount of high-bandwidth connectivity, best provided by an optically connected infrastructure operating at the highest available speeds. Marvell is enabling AI with a broad range of solutions, which include: PAM4-based optical DSPs and AECs for connecting accelerator clusters inside AI data centers; DCI products for connectivity between regional data centers; low-latency high-capacity Ethernet switches for fabric connectivity inside data centers; and custom silicon for compute acceleration. We are confident that the breadth of Marvell's technology positions us as one of a scarce few semiconductor companies that can enable the industry to capitalize on the rapid growth in AI. Marvell's market-leading PAM4 optical DSPs are indispensable for the pluggable optical module ecosystem that cloud customers rely upon to build their massively scalable networks. Our DSPs enable full interoperability and backward and forward compatibility. They also provide the advanced telemetry and diagnostics, critical to maintaining an extremely resilient and serviceable network. We've been shipping the industry's highest-speed 800-gig PAM4 DSPs in high volume for several quarters and have begun sampling our next-generation 1.6T platform. We're seeing demand for connectivity between regional data centers accelerate as inference is deployed across multiple locations. As Ashish told you, Marvell has been a key enabler of this application with our DCI products, and we just announced our plan to demonstrate the industry's first 800ZR modules in October based on our new Orion coherent DSP. Looking at the future of optical connectivity, we are uniquely positioned in the industry with a leadership position in both PAM and coherent technology. We are also excited about the opportunity for our next generation of Ethernet switches, our 51.2T Teralynx 10 platform, which we announced earlier this year. We have begun sampling this product and we are seeing strong interest from customers. Last quarter, we told you how cloud customers are enhancing their AI offerings by building custom accelerators of their own. Trend is leading to a larger and faster-growing opportunity for Marvell's custom compute portfolio. We have won a number of custom silicon programs tied to AI and these are well underway to start ramping into volume production next year. Let me now talk about what we're seeing in storage in data center. As we expected, from a low base in the first quarter, we saw sequential storage data center revenue growth in the second quarter, and we are expecting modest sequential growth in the third quarter. However, storage end market demand remains significantly depressed and customer inventory remains high. As a result, the industry's expectations for a data center storage recovery have pushed out meaningfully. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth from overall cloud to accelerate above last quarter's performance, driven by continued strong growth from cloud AI, as well as standard cloud infrastructure. Demand for our AI products continues to grow at an extraordinary rate and we are working very closely with our customers to meet the rapidly evolving needs. On the other hand, enterprise on-premise is expected to continue to trend down. As a result, we are projecting overall data center revenue in the third quarter to grow in the mid-teens sequentially on a percentage basis. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the second quarter was in line with our guidance at $276 million, declining 3% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Sequential and year-over-year decline were driven entirely by the wired portion of our carrier end market, reflecting ongoing demand weakness and inventory digestion at wired customers. In contrast, our wireless revenue continued to grow in the second quarter, building upon the 25% sequential growth we saw in the first quarter, and we are expecting additional growth in the third quarter. As a result of significant share and content gains for Marvell products in conjunction with the 5G upgrade cycle, we have grown our wireless revenue significantly over a multiyear period. While the full conversion to 5G in the world's installed base of wireless infrastructure will take many years, a number of regions are completing their initial phase of 5G deployments and are taking a pause in a challenging macroeconomic environment before they upgrade the balance of their networks. As a result, following an extended period of strong growth, we are expecting a significant sequential reduction in our wireless revenue in the fourth quarter. However, we expect that once customer and operator inventories normalize and carrier CapEx returns to more healthy levels, we can resume growth in our overall carrier end market and start to realize additional share gains. These will come from 5-nanometer base station designs we have won, but which are not yet in production. In addition, we expect the launch of our next-generation 800-gig Orion coherent DSP platform will drive long-term growth from the wired optical transport market. Moving to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect revenue from our overall carrier end market to grow in the low-single-digit sequentially on a percentage basis driven by wireless. Turning to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $328 million, declining 4% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. As we have been signaling for the last few quarters, we continue to see inventory corrections impact customer demand in this end market. We expect this inventory re-normalization to take a few quarters to resolve as customer balance sheets get worked down over time. While we deal with these market dynamics in the near term, I would note that enterprise networking has been an important contributor to Marvell's successful transformation to a leader in data infrastructure. The Marvell team has driven an extended multi-year period of exceptional revenue growth, with enterprise networking revenue essentially doubling over the last few years. This was enabled by a significant share in content gains, a testament to the consistent investment we've made in refreshing our enterprise networking product portfolio. As Ashish told you, we continue to introduce new products such as the industry's first 5-nanometer multi-gig Ethernet PHY transceiver. Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we project our enterprise networking revenue to decline in the low teens sequentially on a percentage basis due to the market dynamics outlined earlier. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue in the second quarter was $110 million above guidance, growing 32% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was led by our automotive business, which continued to benefit from the growing adoption of Ethernet in cars. We also closed on a number of new automotive Ethernet design wins with multiple top 10 automotive OEMs during the quarter. Looking to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we project revenue from our auto and industrial end market to be flattish sequentially and to continue growing year-over-year in the 30% range. Moving on to our consumer end market, revenue for the second quarter was $168 million, growing 2% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. Revenue was below guidance as deliveries for an end-of-life program were rescheduled to the third quarter. As a result, we are forecasting consumer end-market revenue to grow sequentially in the low teens on a percentage basis in the third quarter. In summary, we delivered revenue and earnings above the midpoint of guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We are forecasting revenue growth to accelerate in the third quarter, accompanied by gross margin expansion. We intend to remain disciplined on operating expenses to help us deliver strong operating leverage. Looking ahead, while inventory digestion in some end markets is taking longer to resolve, demand from AI applications continues to strengthen and Marvell is well-positioned to benefit from that trend. Based on our latest demand outlook for our electro-optics products, we now expect revenue from AI to exit this year at over a $200 million quarterly revenue run rate or $800 million annualized. This is well above what we had outlined last quarter. Put this in perspective, this would put us at the run rate we had previously communicated for all of next year. Looking forward between the ongoing strength from electro-optics and the expected ramp of multiple custom compute programs, we are expecting continued outsized growth from AI. Our results and outlook continue to validate our strategy to focus on developing the most advanced silicon for data infrastructure. The diversification in our end markets is serving us well, with strong growth from AI and cloud carrying us through the softening macro environment. With that, I will turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nWillem Meintjes: Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue in the second quarter was $1.341 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, declining 12% year-over-year and growing 1% sequentially. Data center was our largest end market, driving 34% of total revenue. Enterprise networking was the next largest end market with 24% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 21%, consumer at 13%, and auto/industrial at 8%. GAAP gross margin was 38.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.3%, growing 30 basis points sequentially, driven by cost improvements, partially offset by a weaker revenue mix. Looking ahead, we expect gross margins to continue to improve in the third quarter and then to increase significantly in the fourth quarter. As Matt told you, the recovery in storage continues to push out, which is negatively impacting our product mix. However, in the fourth quarter, we project a significant improvement in our overall product mix to lead to stronger gross margin. We expect this improvement will be driven by our continuing growth in data center, while wireless carrier and consumer revenue declines on a relative basis. In addition, the Marvell team continues to execute well on our efforts to reduce costs. As a result, we continue to target non-GAAP gross margin returning to the bottom end of our long-term model of 64% to 66% in the fourth quarter. Moving on to operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses were $727 million, including share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs, and acquired -- and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $448 million, $7 million below guidance. We are pleased to report that we accelerated our cost reduction plan we outlined last quarter. We remain on track to execute the remainder of our cost reduction plan by the end of this fiscal year, as we communicated last quarter. Moving on to the rest of the income statement. GAAP operating margin was negative 15.7%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.9%. For the second quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.24. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.33, $0.01 above the midpoint of guidance. Now, turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $113 million. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted by an increase in DSO as well as severance-related cash restructuring charges. Our DSO increased [13] (ph) days from the prior quarter, primarily due to worse linearity as we ramp shipments on orders that were received well within lead time. CapEx was $111 million, which included a large number of leading node tape-outs that we expect to drive our future growth. As a reminder, our CapEx can be lumpy in any given quarter. We expect CapEx on average to be approximately mid-single-digits of revenue on a percentage basis. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $1.02 billion, decreasing by $10 million sequentially. We returned $52 million to shareholders through cash dividends. Our total debt was $4.15 billion. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.04 times, and net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.83 times. During the quarter, we paid down $500 million of our total debt. Looking ahead, we will opportunistically explore accessing the debt capital markets to refinance our upcoming debt maturities. As of the end of the second fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $423 million. Turning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.4 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 45.6% to 48%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 60.3% to 61.3%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $666 million to $671 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses will be in the range of $435 million to $440 million. We expect other income and expense, including interest on our debt, to be approximately $48 million. For the third quarter, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 6%. We expect our basic weighted-average shares outstanding to be 863 million and our diluted weighted-average shares outstanding to be 869 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP loss per diluted share in a range of a loss of $0.02 to $0.12 per share. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.35 to $0.45. In summary, for the third quarter, we are guiding for solid sequential revenue growth, further expansion in non-GAAP gross margin, and additional reductions in non-GAAP OpEx, all of which positions Marvell for strong operating leverage and earnings growth. In addition, following the paydown of $500 million in debt in the second quarter, we resumed buybacks in the third quarter. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you. Matt, could you just elaborate a little bit more on the storage business. I am just trying to understand all the dynamics there. So, it sounds like there is a delay in the recovery, obviously, because there's still some inventories out there. But I'm also trying to understand the growth in storage associated with AI. I know these are different architectures, right? But if you could give us any more color on the digestion of the inventory on the compute side, coupled with how storage could benefit more on the AI side?\nMatt Murphy: Yeah, sure. Hey, thanks, Tore, for the question. Yeah, on storage, I would say the best guide post is to look at the end customer commentary and both what the hard drive companies are saying as well as the flash industry, and just relative to the sort of extended time it's taking for inventory to work down at their level. That being said, eventually, it's going to come back. It's a little bit longer than we had modeled, but at this point, we're following the market and following our customers, and hopefully that's sometime at the beginning of next year, in the first half, but we'll see how that goes. But eventually, it will come back. On the AI question, it's kind of interesting. We continue to make attempts to model that. We don't have a great model for storage at this point. We've got I think an excellent view now of where we sit in the block diagrams relative to our optical products, our custom silicon, networking, but the storage impact, in our view, at a high level is net positive, but we don't have a particularly helpful model to how to think about that. Certainly, AI should be an overall tailwind for storage. But I think there is -- that's all caught up in the inventory that's being worked out at the CSPs.\nTore Svanberg: Sounds good. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Thanks a lot. Matt, so AI revenue was supposed to be I think $400 million this year, it's actually going to exit at $200 million a quarter. So, it's going to -- it's, obviously, going to be higher than $400 million for the year. Can you talk about how much of whatever the number will be for the year? Probably $500 million or $550 million something like that I would think. How much of that is going to be custom ASIC? And then next year, you said that AI would be greater than $800 million. Obviously, it's going to be quite a bit greater than $800 million. Can you maybe update that number and give us an idea of how much of that's going to be custom ASIC? I'm guessing $150 million, something like that, but I'm wondering if you can give us some more milepost there. Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Hey, thanks, Tim. Yes. So I think, very encouraged by the demand trajectory upwards on the AI segment for us. Exiting the year at $200 million run rate, that is still mostly driven by the electro-optics platform, the DSPs, TIAs, and drivers at 800-gig. There is probably going to be a little contribution even in the fourth quarter from custom silicon. But that really ramps up more meaningfully next year. But we look at this as just a very positive sign that a quarter ago when we did our -- made our best estimates as to the opportunity in front of us, the fact that exiting the year will be at next year's run rate is very positive. So think of it as this year mostly electro-optics, that's going grow again next year, obviously. And then you need to layer on top a more meaningful ramp in custom silicon. But at this point, demand is so far up into the right, it's actually hard for us to put an exact number or give you a refined number on next year, other than it's going to be obviously bigger than we said the last time around.\nTimothy Arcuri: Right. I guess, just -- but is the -- so there's obviously this big surge happening during the back half of the year. But if you took the AI piece, does it continue at that sort of linear rates through the year, or does it sort of flatten off as you kind of go out through next year? Just trying to shape that. Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. I think it's -- well, I think the way you should think about it is, in Q4, we're already at $200 million. It's going to be at a higher run rate throughout fiscal '25 each quarter. So, it's going to keep growing on the optics side, and then you're going to layer in custom silicon on top. So, we're not -- we're certainly not saying it's going to flatline at that level. We're just saying it's coming a lot faster, demand has been a lot better, supply chain team in Marvell is doing a great job to source the components and the capability that we need. So, I think it's a great setup for next year relative to the AI revenue.\nTimothy Arcuri: Great, Matt. Thank you so much.\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Tim.\nOperator: Your next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Hey, guys, thanks for letting me ask the question. I wanted to ask, it's either Matt or Willem, I guess, on the gross margin. Can you just remind us what the headwinds are that you expect to resolve in Q4? Because I guess storage is taking longer, but I think the gross margin in electro-optics are quite good, so you would think that would be a tailwind. So, could you just walk us through the puts and takes on the gross margin guide, that would be helpful.\nWillem Meintjes: Yeah, thanks, Blayne. Yes, certainly the optics is a tailwind. And then in addition to that, we've signaled that wireless carrier is really stepping down in the fourth quarter and consumer is also really stepping down. So, the combination of those things. And then in addition, our cost structure for our products is really improved. And the overhead on manufacturing and we see that benefit, it's really starting to flow through more significantly in the fourth quarter. So, storage certainly is a headwind for us as that recovery is pushed out.\nBlayne Curtis: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Ramsay: Yeah, thank you very much, guys. Good afternoon. Matt, I think you addressed the AI revenue commentary. I wanted to ask about the sort of goalpost for custom silicon. We had been in -- we've had that conversation around $400 million and then $800 million and then it got pushed out a little bit. And there has been I mean -- I don't think any of us have seen anything like the CapEx shifts that have happened around Generative AI and spending patterns at a lot of your large customers. What we've observed is, a lot of custom compute ASIC programs in flight, some of them are for sort of CPU offload and whether it's called DPU or SmartNIC or whatever you want to call it, some of them are for smaller model inference custom silicon programs at hyperscale. Maybe you could talk a little bit about where your engagements are? What you're seeing in terms of timing and magnitude? Because it's been such a tumultuous CapEx environment with AI versus traditional compute. And if you have any updates on some of those numbers around the custom compute programs and timing, that would be really helpful. Thanks, guys.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah, great. Thanks for the question. I'd say a couple of things, Matt. The first is on your question about the custom silicon opportunity, which really if you sort of summarize the different pieces of it as you mentioned, it's really of all to provide accelerated computing, right, in a custom format for these various companies. I think the overall CapEx shift towards accelerated computing is clearly going to benefit those that are participating in that segment, including us. And we do see -- and some of that overlapped, and that's why last quarter we tried to decouple them somewhat. But some of that revenue obviously overlaps with the AI numbers I gave earlier. But it's certainly a positive setup. We talked about having two different products last quarter that were kind of the lead ones that were tied to AI. One of which was in sample stage. That product is looking very good and most likely go into production first pass. The second product taped out as we expected in the second quarter, and that's also planned to ramp up next year. The size and the timing of those are still to be determined. We're working with our customers on those. But the overall shift in CapEx spending is clearly a tailwind on that business. So I'd sort of say to calibrate it today kind of tracking towards what we updated you guys on the last time, and then next year, it really depends on how much it moves over, Matt, and how much it can actually -- how much business can be driven. So, we're not calling that, other than to say it's -- the custom stuff for us is mostly going to be driven by AI next year in terms of the...\nMatt Ramsay: Got it. No, thank you, Matt. Appreciate it.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.\nHarsh Kumar: Yeah, hey. I think when you talked about gross margin drivers for fourth quarter, Matt, you mentioned that you might be expecting a significant recovery in revenues as well. Did I, a, understand that correctly? And if so, could you talk about what might be happening in the fourth quarter to drive that recovery?\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. You're saying overall, Harsh?\nHarsh Kumar: Yes.\nMatt Murphy: Your question is, what's sort of the view? Yeah, obviously, we're guiding one quarter at a time, but to give you some perspective because we gave you a lots of puts and takes including commentary about carrier and wireless, which we've been actually saying for several quarters now relative to that, 5G run taking a pause. Overall, we expect revenues to be up again in the fourth quarter. We were sort of consistent with what we outlined in last quarter's call, which is that Q3 and Q4 growth would accelerate. So kind of think of that as -- growing again in the fourth quarter sort of like we did in Q3. But really driven by cloud and AI, and AI being the big driver. But also as we said in our prepared remarks, standard cloud infrastructure revenues are also growing very nicely through the year, not only from Q2 -- Q1 to Q2 and Q2 to Q3, but also into the fourth quarter and beyond. And that means if you kind of do the back of the envelope, data center becomes a bigger part of our revenue and AI becomes a bigger part of our revenue by the fourth quarter. And then overall Marvell, Inc. is also up. So, I just kind of frame it at a high level, we did set out a long time ago to have a diversified strategy within data infrastructure by serving multiple end markets with a suite of products. So, we've got enterprise, 5G, automotive, data center. And as you've seen even in this dynamic environment, certain quarters some are performing better than others, and then we're sort of blessed to have markets that then have kicked in at the right time. So, even in a tough macro right now, Marvell is continuing to grow throughout the year starting from our first quarter, and we anticipate that growth obviously going through Q3 and then through Q4. But the mix shifting by end market, if that makes sense. I know you will create your model and -- we give enough commentary I think to put the pieces together.\nHarsh Kumar: No, we appreciate it, Matt. Thank you so much.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Please go ahead.\nChristopher Rolland: Hey, thanks for the question. And this one is for Matt. Just kind of an amazing revision here on the electro-optics portion. Since you've seen this inflection, you probably done some more research here, how are you thinking about the attach rate for these products per GPU, call it, is it one for one? Are you thinking it could be two for one? I've seen some research that suggests depending on how many layers there are, could even be three per one. And is the revenue that we're talking about here, all 800-gig PAM4 DSPs? Is there anything else related in that as well? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Yeah, I think it's fairly similar to our view last quarter. We were pretty clear about the direct attach, which was the one-to-one you mentioned. Understanding that as you get to the upper layers of the network, there is more, and there is a range and you probably size the range. We're still I think refining our exact models there, so I don't know if I have an exact number to give you. But I think you're thinking about it the right way, starting at the direct attach and then building higher. And the second part of your question, it's all 800-gig for AI, at this point. We have strong traction on our next-generation products at 1.6T, which would be starting sometime next year. The products that are at frequencies lower than 800 gigabits are typically served for the traditional cloud infrastructure, which is also seeing a recovery as well. So, hopefully that's helpful.\nChristopher Rolland: Fantastic. Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: The next question is from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nRoss Seymore: Hi, guys. I don't know if this one is for Matt or Willem. But I just wanted to talk about the puts and takes to next year's gross margin, and I know you're not guiding that far out with any specifics. But it seems like you're going to have a number of custom products that will be going up in the data center side, the storage side should recover at some point in time. But the general question is if custom products tend to be lower gross margin and storage and some other areas like enterprise eventually come back cyclically, how do we think about the puts and takes in your gross margin versus that 64% to 66% historical target range?\nWillem Meintjes: Yeah, Ross, maybe I can start and Matt can add. So, when you look back, certainly over the last couple of years, we've grown both our carrier and ASIC business sort of faster than the rest of the business. And we were able to maintain our gross margin within our target range. We're targeting to get back to that 64% exiting this year and then to maintain that through next year. But clearly, it's sort of early to decide exactly how big the ASIC ramp is next year. Now if we do show outsized growth there, that would negatively impact our gross margin, but certainly our view is that, that would be very accretive to operating income and to EPS. But it's too early right now to know exactly the extent of that. Hopefully, that's helpful, Ross.\nMatt Murphy: And Ross, maybe -- it's Matt, I'll just add. I think the -- clearly, the custom business carries a lower gross margin, we've been very open about that. But I think looking out to next year, it's a little early to call it, right? We don't know the rate of recovery for storage, that's a big part of the equation. We also have what's the -- even within like AI and cloud, what's the optics revenue going to be versus the custom stuff. You've got automotive continuing to perform well and growing, which is a higher-than-average gross margin category for us. So, we've got a lot of irons in the fire relative to various businesses that may or may not pick up at different times. As Willem said, we had a pretty consistent ability to manage gross margins in the range that we were targeting, understanding there is mix issues all the time. We've been going through a period here Q1, Q2, and Q3, where we've had it for a longer period, I'd say, unfavorable gross margin relative to our traditional mix. But it's such a dynamic environment, it's really hard to call the ball exactly, Ross, on when all those markets sort of burn through inventory, kickback back in, what is the recovery look like. But when we look at it a very high level, we continue to believe we have a very nice balanced portfolio of different products, technologies with different business models behind them that generate different gross and operating margin profiles. And as an example, like Willem said just because some of these custom programs are at lower than corporate average gross margin, especially if they ramp significantly, they are extremely accretive to operating margin and operating income at the bottom line level, which ultimately over time is what we're laser-focused on is driving earnings per share and driving operating profits for the company. So, high-level answer, but maybe it just frames it up, we need a little more time in front of us to really figure out what that looks like for next year.\nRoss Seymore: Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thank you for taking my question. Matt, I was hoping you could help us size how big storage is. Currently, in the quarter you reported both kind of data center and outside of data center. And I forgot whether you mentioned whether that's going to be up/down/flat in Q3 and Q4, or can it kind of hold at these low levels? And what are you looking for to inform you as to when it starts to grow sequentially, like how much excess inventory is out there, or do you think that it can actually hold at these low levels? So, just help us kind of set what the right baseline view is of storage as you get into next year.\nMatt Murphy: Sure, thanks, Vivek. It's a great question, okay, I think it's in some ways a million-dollar question. Let me tell you where we're at so far. So, obviously, Q1 was very, very low in terms of our storage revenues, and in particular, we're really talking about data center storage, if you think about it. The consumer piece is kind of hung in there because of some the specific applications we have. But that's -- what's moving the needle is the data center side. In Q2, it had recovered, which was nice to see. It was coming off a bottom, right around $100 million, let's call it, something like that. And then, from there, we said in our prepared remarks, Q3 we'd see a modest recovery again. So that would be up. It's still not sloping towards I think where we thought it was going to be a quarter or two ago relative to the year-end exit rate, and I think most of the end customer commentary suggests this is more of a first half of '24 type of recovery. But I guess the good news is, it's come off the bottom, good growth in Q2, it's going to grow again in Q3, and it will grow again in Q4. But it's just not quite at that slope and that rate. When we've dug in with the customer base kind of all the way to the end companies that consume the storage, it's hard to get an exact clear picture of where the inventory is and the timing, as I mentioned. However, what we do understand is that there's a lot of activity on qualifying the next-generation drives in technologies. There's a big TCO benefit. We haven't been able to detect anything structurally that's changed per se, although we continue to study that. So, in our mind, it looks like this has to come back to where it was at some point in terms of the number of exabytes that are being shipped or consumed, and it should grow from there for all the reasons that's been growing for the last 20 years. And AI, there was a question earlier about that, it's probably a tailwind on that. But I think with how far back we are on the supply chain, I'll just conclude my remarks by saying it's just very difficult to get a full read on where it all is, what's going on at the end customer level, and when it comes back. So, all we can do is sort of look at what our customers are saying and talking to us about and follow their lead. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nVivek Arya: Yes. Thank you, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thank you. Hi, Matt. My question is on the custom silicon side, I think you called out two programs that -- in AI that you expect to ramp next year. Can you talk about the design win pipeline? And also I want -- if you could touch on, I know it's difficult to predict what kind of revenue opportunity -- forecast the revenue opportunity this early, but could you give us at least some sense, because some of these programs -- we do hear that some of these programs do get canceled. So, just want to make sure that you have that visibility that these programs are for real, what you have for next year. And then, if you can talk about other opportunities beyond those two programs that you talked about, that will be helpful. Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah, great question. Let me start with the, are they real, because I think that was the big question. Probably two quarters back, Srini, and even at the end of last year when I think the reality of the macroeconomy really hit the cloud companies pretty significantly and that's when you saw those companies at a very high level take actions on headcount, take actions on expenses, look at program priorities down at the infrastructure level. And part of our call in Q1 and Q2 was sort of advising investors how that had changed. What emerged from that was a shift from traditional cloud infrastructure to AI, now we've seen that play out through the first half of the year. So, those programs not only are getting funded there, there is extreme urgency around them. And so, now we're at a point given where these products are at, actually talking about when do we start wafers, how do we make sure the capacity is lined up, how do we have three-way calls to make sure we're all dialed-in on what's needed. So, that gives us quite a bit of comfort, and that -- and we were further along. In a quarter from now, two quarters from now, we'll be even farther along relative to being able to provide more visibility on what that ramp looks like. But we feel good about that. And certainly going through that process, we -- for all the programs in the pipeline, we have both one an open a good view of where our customers want to go. On the opportunity size, just to give you a sense, if you look at the overall Marvell's total design opportunity pipeline, the biggest segment is data center, it wouldn't surprise you, but it's a huge portion of our open funnel. And of that, we look at it every quarter the AI portion just continues to grow and has become very significant from an opportunity standpoint. And what I would say is, it's really a combination of all the technologies I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's the PAM products going from 800 gig to 1.60T, it's our AEC offerings, it's the big custom compute silicon programs that are out there and there's a tremendous urgency to increase the beat rate on those and get them out faster. Significant interest in our Ethernet switching platform at 51.2T. Not only that, the roadmap beyond that. We have a number of new exciting technologies too like bringing silicon photonics inside the data center. So, when you think about the conversations we're having, it's just a number of technologies that really work well together. And I think customers are engaging with us now to figure out how they can get the best out of Marvell overall and really differentiate themselves within their data center architectures, on TCO, on power, on performance and using the suite of technologies and really optimizing for their architecture. So I'd say there's a number of sockets, the pipeline is big, those are all the catch-all, that sounds great. But I'd say the more strategic and interesting piece and that's where I'm spending time is really making sure we marshal the resources of Marvell to engage very deeply at the highest levels with our big cloud customers and partners in the ecosystem and present ourselves as one company with a suite of solutions that can process the data, it can move the data, it can store the data, and it can even secure the data inside your cloud. And I think all of those together is very exciting. So, yes, we'll see, lots of opportunity in front of us.\nSrini Pajjuri: Thanks, Matt.\nOperator: The next question is from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I know there's been a lot of focus on your electro-optical business tied to AI. But I think the bigger portion of your electro-optical business is focused on the persistent upgrade cycles across the entire cloud data center footprint, right? And I think these tailwinds are still in front of the team, right? I think you still have -- there still is one more cloud titan that is yet to upgrade to 400-gig across its data center. You still have the 800-gig 1.6T optical upgrade across the remaining three titans. And then on DCI, you're still ramping 400ZR DCI, but you still I think have two more cloud customers that are in the pipeline. So, are these broad upgrade cycles starting to line up to fire next year, maybe even some starting in the second half of this year, maybe it ties into some of your commentary on strength in broader cloud. But just trying to get a sense of the ramp profile on these upgrade cycles.\nMatt Murphy: I think you did a great job summarizing it. The AI piece has obviously become very meaningful and we gave a sense of what that level of revenue is going to be in the fourth quarter. So it's pretty amazing how fast that's grown obviously. But to your point, the standard cloud infrastructure side of connectivity is having a nice recovery off of some inventory that was built last year, that's now becoming a tailwind as that burns down. You pointed out that there's still a major cloud company to go through their upgrades. So that's also in front of us. As we transition each of the technologies, in terms of speed, there is always an ASP bump and it makes sense, because you're delivering, 2x bandwidth for not 2x the price, right? So, we're on a nice sort of share the benefits with our customer trajectory there. And even at 1.6T for next year while AI will lead it, right behind it, it's going to be a key part of the overall infrastructure build probably the year after. And then the regional data center stuff, which is really the ZR products, also just doing extremely well this year. I mean large upsides due to Generative AI. And then, we said in the prepared remarks and we just put out the press release, I think it was today or it was yesterday about 800ZR, and there'll be more to come on that. But there is another frequency kicker coming in probably faster than we would have thought if you went back six or nine months ago because that between data center bandwidth is actually now becoming a bottleneck. So just tremendous across-the-board opportunities that are not just AI, but it's really driving our cloud growth, and that's -- a lot of that we're seeing in the second half and we're going to see it through next year. So, we have both of those irons in the fire for Marvell overall growth.\nHarlan Sur: Perfect. Thank you, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you very much. Willem, I had a question on the cash flow side. I was trying to see if there was a discernible pattern of seasonality, doesn't seem to be. But you gave a reason for DSOs and impacting the (CFO] (ph). Could you kind of just walk us through how should we think about cash flow for the rest of the year?\nWillem Meintjes: Yeah, sure. Thanks, Ambrish. Yes, so this quarter certainly DSO was impacted somewhat by linearity. We do expect a nice back -- bounce-back in Q3 and some normalization. As we've mentioned, we're really focused on driving down our days of inventory and we've consistently reduced that through this year, and we expect to continue driving that down through the rest of this year. And so, yes, you should expect some good improvement in the second half here.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Okay. And my quick question for you, Matt. We're hearing a lot of companies are talking about the pushouts of CapEx, general-purpose CPU towards AI. I know you addressed it in some ways earlier. But are you seeing that manifest in your business that certain projects are being sacrificed at the AI alter?\nMatt Murphy: Funny way to phrase it. Yes, I think there's two aspects. I think one is, were there project reprioritization or not within those companies. And then also, is it affecting our business right now, which is kind of the two pieces. So, our view is, on the first one, at least for Marvell, I can't comment about everybody, but for us, we really worked through that issue at the end of last year, early this year. There was a big, I'd say kind of re-prioritization that went on, first, driven by the budget squeeze and companies just trying to get more efficient. And then almost in line with that was sort of the release of ChatGPT and the realization that there was this potential massive opportunity, right, for productivity gains through AI and then what are people going to do and then sort of the race was on. So, from that standpoint, we feel very good about our WIP and what we're working on and that -- at least for us, those decisions and re-prioritizations were made. And some of those are why we were lighter on our custom silicon revenue this year. We sort of talked about that a couple of quarters ago. So those programs got delayed. So, we've I guess taken some medicine on that and we moved past it, now we've got this off to the races with the AI stuff. And then, on our current business as you saw, we had -- in Q2, we had overall data center revenues up pretty nicely and that included on-prem being down, AI being up a lot, but we also said that standard cloud infrastructure was up and it's going to be up again nicely in the third quarter and it's going to continue through the fourth quarter into next year. So, I think we've worked through that as well. And probably the reason we don't get hit quite as much there is that we're tied more to the networking and connectivity than selling CPUs as an example. And so, that overall kind of network bandwidth needs to continue to get upgraded and deal with it, because a lot of these big data centers are multi-tenant and they've got AI sitting in there, and they've got specialty built servers and storage for other things, but it all needs to work together and it all needs to ultimately have the right level of bandwidth to support the compute power. So those are some puts and takes. I think the headwind on the whole thing would -- for us really would be the storage piece, which shows up in our data center near-line and that we've just been kind of -- I answered the questions about that already. So that's the puts and takes, but overall it's actually growing very nicely for us. It will be a growth driver for us next year too.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Got it. Thank you, Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nChris Caso: Yes, thank you. I guess the question is digging into the enterprise on-premise a little bit more. If you give some detail on what you include in that, that's still looking to be down, does that include, for example, fiber channel as well? And do you think that business -- that this will mark a bottom to that business? Yeah, obviously, probably difficult to figure out when that starts getting better.\nMatt Murphy: Hey, Chris, thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, it's -- enterprise on-premise business has just kept coming down. Now I think the reality is if you look at overall enterprise server shipments and you look at sort of the end data, that's probably been down for, I don't know, eight quarters or something. So, the end markets just not doing as well. It's mostly fiber channel that's within there. There's also some Ethernet and some NIC products as well. I don't know that we're necessarily calling a bottom, but it's got to be close just because at some point, people need to -- people actually need to buy servers and customers need to work through inventory. So, it's been a headwind. I think we're close to it, maybe needs a little more time, maybe another quarter. But at some point, that will renormalize as well. And it's obviously within overall data center, all of that sort of inventory adjustment and weakness at the end market levels being just blown away, obviously, by the AI and cloud infrastructure piece, which is still driving very healthy growth into Q3 and then another step-up obviously in Q4. And that's assuming really no material recovery in the on-prem side. But I do expect over time, if you just sort of step back and look at like fiber channel, it's been a pretty stable business for us, ever since we've owned it through the Cavium acquisition. And we don't see any reason why, at some point, that just doesn't come back to where it was. And when it does that, that will also be a positive thing for us. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nChris Caso: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. Please go ahead.\nQuinn Bolton: Hey, Matt, I wanted to ask, you talked about the electro-optics driving most of that $200 million of AI revenue. Can you give us some sense how much of that is InfiniBand versus Ethernet within those 800-gig modules? And do you guys see any share difference between your position in Ethernet versus InfiniBand? I know your share is very high in general in that market, but just wondering if you would say your share is higher either in the Ethernet or InfiniBand. And then I got a follow-up.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah, maybe the simple answer is, first of all, as you point out, we're agnostic. We participate broadly in the connectivity independent of whether it's InfiniBand or Ethernet. And I'd say that we continue to have very high market share and penetration into both those applications. And the demand we're seeing is broad-based from both of those as well as multiple customers driving it. So, it's actually really kind of hard to break it down exactly. And I don't know that it's super helpful, because overall, the shares still very healthy, and we're agnostic. So, the same module can kind of be used in either one.\nQuinn Bolton: Got it. Okay. So it's pretty broad-based across both. The follow-up question is just you mentioned 51.2 terabit switch and starting to sample. Just as you look out to calendar '24, fiscal '25, do you see that starting to get deployed at the U.S. hyperscaler partners?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, I think we'll have some contribution from that product area next year. The bigger ramp is a little bit further out. But very pleased, I'd say, with the open funnel on that technology. I'm very happy with the team. I mean this -- the architecture and the key pieces of that initially came from Innovium, right, which is a company we acquired in 2021. But the thing that we did upfront is we put it on the Marvell 5-nanometer design flow using our SerDes, our IP platform, our new product development process. So you kind of got the best of both worlds and teams executed extremely well on the chip. And as a result, it's giving customers confidence we can really be there for them not only on the feature set, including very, very low latency and in the right power envelope, but also being able to manufacture for high volume, which is no small task on these effectively reticle buster type switches or type products. So we'll see how it goes, Quinn, but pipeline is strong. This is going to be a big upgrade cycle for the industry. And I think it's going to be overall positive for the people that are in that ecosystem.\nQuinn Bolton: Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: I think we'll do one -- perfect, Quinn. And I think we'll do, Gary, one more question, and then we can wrap it.\nOperator: And that question will be from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.\nGary Mobley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I don't think there's been a mention so far the influence on an extra week in the fourth quarter. Matt, I want to verify your expectation of sequential revenue growth in the fourth quarter. Is that independent of the extra week or inclusive of the extra week? And Willem, the target of OpEx for the fourth quarter, I think you said $430 million with the extra week. Is that still the target?\nWillem Meintjes: That's correct.\nMatt Murphy: Okay. Willem, you want to go? Then, I'll go.\nWillem Meintjes: Yeah, sure. Yeah, just on the OpEx, that's correct, Gary. So for the 13 weeks normalized, we said $420 million. And so, for the full 14 weeks, we guided $430 million. So you've got the correct number.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. And then on the revenue side, Gary, it's been my experience doing this for a long time and having the famous 14-week quarter roll through, it's -- I think the best practice I found is, you end up really not getting the extra revenue per se, but you got to obviously count the expenses. So that's sort of the way to think about it. So, we don't -- we're not saying, hey, because Q4 is 14 weeks, we're going to have some better growth than we would have. I think it's just -- that's kind of what the market is doing. So the -- and then Willem gave you sort of the run rate on OpEx. If you look at it, netting out what 13 weeks would have been, which is about $420 million.\nGary Mobley: Got it. Thanks, again, guys.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Willem Meintjes",
            "content": "Thanks, Matt, and good afternoon, everyone. Let me start with a summary of our financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue in the second quarter was $1.341 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance, declining 12% year-over-year and growing 1% sequentially. Data center was our largest end market, driving 34% of total revenue. Enterprise networking was the next largest end market with 24% of total revenue, followed by carrier infrastructure at 21%, consumer at 13%, and auto/industrial at 8%. GAAP gross margin was 38.9%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60.3%, growing 30 basis points sequentially, driven by cost improvements, partially offset by a weaker revenue mix. Looking ahead, we expect gross margins to continue to improve in the third quarter and then to increase significantly in the fourth quarter. As Matt told you, the recovery in storage continues to push out, which is negatively impacting our product mix. However, in the fourth quarter, we project a significant improvement in our overall product mix to lead to stronger gross margin. We expect this improvement will be driven by our continuing growth in data center, while wireless carrier and consumer revenue declines on a relative basis. In addition, the Marvell team continues to execute well on our efforts to reduce costs. As a result, we continue to target non-GAAP gross margin returning to the bottom end of our long-term model of 64% to 66% in the fourth quarter. Moving on to operating expenses. GAAP operating expenses were $727 million, including share-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs, and acquired -- and acquisition-related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $448 million, $7 million below guidance. We are pleased to report that we accelerated our cost reduction plan we outlined last quarter. We remain on track to execute the remainder of our cost reduction plan by the end of this fiscal year, as we communicated last quarter. Moving on to the rest of the income statement. GAAP operating margin was negative 15.7%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 26.9%. For the second quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.24. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.33, $0.01 above the midpoint of guidance. Now, turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was $113 million. Operating cash flow was negatively impacted by an increase in DSO as well as severance-related cash restructuring charges. Our DSO increased [13] (ph) days from the prior quarter, primarily due to worse linearity as we ramp shipments on orders that were received well within lead time. CapEx was $111 million, which included a large number of leading node tape-outs that we expect to drive our future growth. As a reminder, our CapEx can be lumpy in any given quarter. We expect CapEx on average to be approximately mid-single-digits of revenue on a percentage basis. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was $1.02 billion, decreasing by $10 million sequentially. We returned $52 million to shareholders through cash dividends. Our total debt was $4.15 billion. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.04 times, and net debt to EBITDA ratio was 1.83 times. During the quarter, we paid down $500 million of our total debt. Looking ahead, we will opportunistically explore accessing the debt capital markets to refinance our upcoming debt maturities. As of the end of the second fiscal quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were $423 million. Turning to our guidance for the third quarter of fiscal 2024. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of $1.4 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 45.6% to 48%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 60.3% to 61.3%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $666 million to $671 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses will be in the range of $435 million to $440 million. We expect other income and expense, including interest on our debt, to be approximately $48 million. For the third quarter, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 6%. We expect our basic weighted-average shares outstanding to be 863 million and our diluted weighted-average shares outstanding to be 869 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP loss per diluted share in a range of a loss of $0.02 to $0.12 per share. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.35 to $0.45. In summary, for the third quarter, we are guiding for solid sequential revenue growth, further expansion in non-GAAP gross margin, and additional reductions in non-GAAP OpEx, all of which positions Marvell for strong operating leverage and earnings growth. In addition, following the paydown of $500 million in debt in the second quarter, we resumed buybacks in the third quarter. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. Yeah, thanks, Blayne. Yes, certainly the optics is a tailwind. And then in addition to that, we've signaled that wireless carrier is really stepping down in the fourth quarter and consumer is also really stepping down. So, the combination of those things. And then in addition, our cost structure for our products is really improved. And the overhead on manufacturing and we see that benefit, it's really starting to flow through more significantly in the fourth quarter. So, storage certainly is a headwind for us as that recovery is pushed out. Yeah, Ross, maybe I can start and Matt can add. So, when you look back, certainly over the last couple of years, we've grown both our carrier and ASIC business sort of faster than the rest of the business. And we were able to maintain our gross margin within our target range. We're targeting to get back to that 64% exiting this year and then to maintain that through next year. But clearly, it's sort of early to decide exactly how big the ASIC ramp is next year. Now if we do show outsized growth there, that would negatively impact our gross margin, but certainly our view is that, that would be very accretive to operating income and to EPS. But it's too early right now to know exactly the extent of that. Hopefully, that's helpful, Ross. Yeah, sure. Thanks, Ambrish. Yes, so this quarter certainly DSO was impacted somewhat by linearity. We do expect a nice back -- bounce-back in Q3 and some normalization. As we've mentioned, we're really focused on driving down our days of inventory and we've consistently reduced that through this year, and we expect to continue driving that down through the rest of this year. And so, yes, you should expect some good improvement in the second half here. That's correct. Yeah, sure. Yeah, just on the OpEx, that's correct, Gary. So for the 13 weeks normalized, we said $420 million. And so, for the full 14 weeks, we guided $430 million. So you've got the correct number."

            "content": "Thanks, Ashish, and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, the Marvell team continued to execute, delivering revenue of $1.34 billion. These results were above the midpoint of our guidance, primarily driven by demand from AI applications growing faster than our prior forecast. Our non-GAAP operating expenses were better than guidance due to an acceleration of the cost reduction plan we outlined last quarter. As a result, our non-GAAP earnings per share was $0.33, $0.01 above the midpoint of our guidance. We are pleased with our performance for the quarter in a challenging macro environment. Let me now move on to reviewing our results and expectations by end market, starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the second quarter was $460 million, growing 6% sequentially, well above our guidance for a flat outlook. We were able to outperform our guidance in this end market because of accelerating demand for optical products to meet the continuing expansion of cloud AI deployments. Our overall revenue from cloud grew over 20% sequentially. Notably, revenue from both cloud AI and standard cloud infrastructure grew sequentially, with AI growing faster. As expected, revenue from the enterprise on-premise portion of our data center end market declined significantly on a sequential basis in the second quarter, reflecting a weakening enterprise market. As you heard in detail last quarter, AI infrastructure requires a staggering amount of high-bandwidth connectivity, best provided by an optically connected infrastructure operating at the highest available speeds. Marvell is enabling AI with a broad range of solutions, which include: PAM4-based optical DSPs and AECs for connecting accelerator clusters inside AI data centers; DCI products for connectivity between regional data centers; low-latency high-capacity Ethernet switches for fabric connectivity inside data centers; and custom silicon for compute acceleration. We are confident that the breadth of Marvell's technology positions us as one of a scarce few semiconductor companies that can enable the industry to capitalize on the rapid growth in AI. Marvell's market-leading PAM4 optical DSPs are indispensable for the pluggable optical module ecosystem that cloud customers rely upon to build their massively scalable networks. Our DSPs enable full interoperability and backward and forward compatibility. They also provide the advanced telemetry and diagnostics, critical to maintaining an extremely resilient and serviceable network. We've been shipping the industry's highest-speed 800-gig PAM4 DSPs in high volume for several quarters and have begun sampling our next-generation 1.6T platform. We're seeing demand for connectivity between regional data centers accelerate as inference is deployed across multiple locations. As Ashish told you, Marvell has been a key enabler of this application with our DCI products, and we just announced our plan to demonstrate the industry's first 800ZR modules in October based on our new Orion coherent DSP. Looking at the future of optical connectivity, we are uniquely positioned in the industry with a leadership position in both PAM and coherent technology. We are also excited about the opportunity for our next generation of Ethernet switches, our 51.2T Teralynx 10 platform, which we announced earlier this year. We have begun sampling this product and we are seeing strong interest from customers. Last quarter, we told you how cloud customers are enhancing their AI offerings by building custom accelerators of their own. Trend is leading to a larger and faster-growing opportunity for Marvell's custom compute portfolio. We have won a number of custom silicon programs tied to AI and these are well underway to start ramping into volume production next year. Let me now talk about what we're seeing in storage in data center. As we expected, from a low base in the first quarter, we saw sequential storage data center revenue growth in the second quarter, and we are expecting modest sequential growth in the third quarter. However, storage end market demand remains significantly depressed and customer inventory remains high. As a result, the industry's expectations for a data center storage recovery have pushed out meaningfully. Looking ahead to the third quarter, we expect sequential revenue growth from overall cloud to accelerate above last quarter's performance, driven by continued strong growth from cloud AI, as well as standard cloud infrastructure. Demand for our AI products continues to grow at an extraordinary rate and we are working very closely with our customers to meet the rapidly evolving needs. On the other hand, enterprise on-premise is expected to continue to trend down. As a result, we are projecting overall data center revenue in the third quarter to grow in the mid-teens sequentially on a percentage basis. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market. Revenue for the second quarter was in line with our guidance at $276 million, declining 3% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. Sequential and year-over-year decline were driven entirely by the wired portion of our carrier end market, reflecting ongoing demand weakness and inventory digestion at wired customers. In contrast, our wireless revenue continued to grow in the second quarter, building upon the 25% sequential growth we saw in the first quarter, and we are expecting additional growth in the third quarter. As a result of significant share and content gains for Marvell products in conjunction with the 5G upgrade cycle, we have grown our wireless revenue significantly over a multiyear period. While the full conversion to 5G in the world's installed base of wireless infrastructure will take many years, a number of regions are completing their initial phase of 5G deployments and are taking a pause in a challenging macroeconomic environment before they upgrade the balance of their networks. As a result, following an extended period of strong growth, we are expecting a significant sequential reduction in our wireless revenue in the fourth quarter. However, we expect that once customer and operator inventories normalize and carrier CapEx returns to more healthy levels, we can resume growth in our overall carrier end market and start to realize additional share gains. These will come from 5-nanometer base station designs we have won, but which are not yet in production. In addition, we expect the launch of our next-generation 800-gig Orion coherent DSP platform will drive long-term growth from the wired optical transport market. Moving to our outlook for the third quarter, we expect revenue from our overall carrier end market to grow in the low-single-digit sequentially on a percentage basis driven by wireless. Turning to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the second quarter was $328 million, declining 4% year-over-year and 10% sequentially. As we have been signaling for the last few quarters, we continue to see inventory corrections impact customer demand in this end market. We expect this inventory re-normalization to take a few quarters to resolve as customer balance sheets get worked down over time. While we deal with these market dynamics in the near term, I would note that enterprise networking has been an important contributor to Marvell's successful transformation to a leader in data infrastructure. The Marvell team has driven an extended multi-year period of exceptional revenue growth, with enterprise networking revenue essentially doubling over the last few years. This was enabled by a significant share in content gains, a testament to the consistent investment we've made in refreshing our enterprise networking product portfolio. As Ashish told you, we continue to introduce new products such as the industry's first 5-nanometer multi-gig Ethernet PHY transceiver. Looking ahead to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we project our enterprise networking revenue to decline in the low teens sequentially on a percentage basis due to the market dynamics outlined earlier. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market. Revenue in the second quarter was $110 million above guidance, growing 32% year-over-year and 23% sequentially. Year-over-year growth was led by our automotive business, which continued to benefit from the growing adoption of Ethernet in cars. We also closed on a number of new automotive Ethernet design wins with multiple top 10 automotive OEMs during the quarter. Looking to the third quarter of fiscal 2024, we project revenue from our auto and industrial end market to be flattish sequentially and to continue growing year-over-year in the 30% range. Moving on to our consumer end market, revenue for the second quarter was $168 million, growing 2% year-over-year and 18% sequentially. Revenue was below guidance as deliveries for an end-of-life program were rescheduled to the third quarter. As a result, we are forecasting consumer end-market revenue to grow sequentially in the low teens on a percentage basis in the third quarter. In summary, we delivered revenue and earnings above the midpoint of guidance for the fiscal second quarter. We are forecasting revenue growth to accelerate in the third quarter, accompanied by gross margin expansion. We intend to remain disciplined on operating expenses to help us deliver strong operating leverage. Looking ahead, while inventory digestion in some end markets is taking longer to resolve, demand from AI applications continues to strengthen and Marvell is well-positioned to benefit from that trend. Based on our latest demand outlook for our electro-optics products, we now expect revenue from AI to exit this year at over a $200 million quarterly revenue run rate or $800 million annualized. This is well above what we had outlined last quarter. Put this in perspective, this would put us at the run rate we had previously communicated for all of next year. Looking forward between the ongoing strength from electro-optics and the expected ramp of multiple custom compute programs, we are expecting continued outsized growth from AI. Our results and outlook continue to validate our strategy to focus on developing the most advanced silicon for data infrastructure. The diversification in our end markets is serving us well, with strong growth from AI and cloud carrying us through the softening macro environment. With that, I will turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Yeah, sure. Hey, thanks, Tore, for the question. Yeah, on storage, I would say the best guide post is to look at the end customer commentary and both what the hard drive companies are saying as well as the flash industry, and just relative to the sort of extended time it's taking for inventory to work down at their level. That being said, eventually, it's going to come back. It's a little bit longer than we had modeled, but at this point, we're following the market and following our customers, and hopefully that's sometime at the beginning of next year, in the first half, but we'll see how that goes. But eventually, it will come back. On the AI question, it's kind of interesting. We continue to make attempts to model that. We don't have a great model for storage at this point. We've got I think an excellent view now of where we sit in the block diagrams relative to our optical products, our custom silicon, networking, but the storage impact, in our view, at a high level is net positive, but we don't have a particularly helpful model to how to think about that. Certainly, AI should be an overall tailwind for storage. But I think there is -- that's all caught up in the inventory that's being worked out at the CSPs. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, thanks, Tim. Yes. So I think, very encouraged by the demand trajectory upwards on the AI segment for us. Exiting the year at $200 million run rate, that is still mostly driven by the electro-optics platform, the DSPs, TIAs, and drivers at 800-gig. There is probably going to be a little contribution even in the fourth quarter from custom silicon. But that really ramps up more meaningfully next year. But we look at this as just a very positive sign that a quarter ago when we did our -- made our best estimates as to the opportunity in front of us, the fact that exiting the year will be at next year's run rate is very positive. So think of it as this year mostly electro-optics, that's going grow again next year, obviously. And then you need to layer on top a more meaningful ramp in custom silicon. But at this point, demand is so far up into the right, it's actually hard for us to put an exact number or give you a refined number on next year, other than it's going to be obviously bigger than we said the last time around. Yeah. I think it's -- well, I think the way you should think about it is, in Q4, we're already at $200 million. It's going to be at a higher run rate throughout fiscal '25 each quarter. So, it's going to keep growing on the optics side, and then you're going to layer in custom silicon on top. So, we're not -- we're certainly not saying it's going to flatline at that level. We're just saying it's coming a lot faster, demand has been a lot better, supply chain team in Marvell is doing a great job to source the components and the capability that we need. So, I think it's a great setup for next year relative to the AI revenue. Thanks, Tim. Yeah, great. Thanks for the question. I'd say a couple of things, Matt. The first is on your question about the custom silicon opportunity, which really if you sort of summarize the different pieces of it as you mentioned, it's really of all to provide accelerated computing, right, in a custom format for these various companies. I think the overall CapEx shift towards accelerated computing is clearly going to benefit those that are participating in that segment, including us. And we do see -- and some of that overlapped, and that's why last quarter we tried to decouple them somewhat. But some of that revenue obviously overlaps with the AI numbers I gave earlier. But it's certainly a positive setup. We talked about having two different products last quarter that were kind of the lead ones that were tied to AI. One of which was in sample stage. That product is looking very good and most likely go into production first pass. The second product taped out as we expected in the second quarter, and that's also planned to ramp up next year. The size and the timing of those are still to be determined. We're working with our customers on those. But the overall shift in CapEx spending is clearly a tailwind on that business. So I'd sort of say to calibrate it today kind of tracking towards what we updated you guys on the last time, and then next year, it really depends on how much it moves over, Matt, and how much it can actually -- how much business can be driven. So, we're not calling that, other than to say it's -- the custom stuff for us is mostly going to be driven by AI next year in terms of the... Yeah. Yeah. You're saying overall, Harsh? Your question is, what's sort of the view? Yeah, obviously, we're guiding one quarter at a time, but to give you some perspective because we gave you a lots of puts and takes including commentary about carrier and wireless, which we've been actually saying for several quarters now relative to that, 5G run taking a pause. Overall, we expect revenues to be up again in the fourth quarter. We were sort of consistent with what we outlined in last quarter's call, which is that Q3 and Q4 growth would accelerate. So kind of think of that as -- growing again in the fourth quarter sort of like we did in Q3. But really driven by cloud and AI, and AI being the big driver. But also as we said in our prepared remarks, standard cloud infrastructure revenues are also growing very nicely through the year, not only from Q2 -- Q1 to Q2 and Q2 to Q3, but also into the fourth quarter and beyond. And that means if you kind of do the back of the envelope, data center becomes a bigger part of our revenue and AI becomes a bigger part of our revenue by the fourth quarter. And then overall Marvell, Inc. is also up. So, I just kind of frame it at a high level, we did set out a long time ago to have a diversified strategy within data infrastructure by serving multiple end markets with a suite of products. So, we've got enterprise, 5G, automotive, data center. And as you've seen even in this dynamic environment, certain quarters some are performing better than others, and then we're sort of blessed to have markets that then have kicked in at the right time. So, even in a tough macro right now, Marvell is continuing to grow throughout the year starting from our first quarter, and we anticipate that growth obviously going through Q3 and then through Q4. But the mix shifting by end market, if that makes sense. I know you will create your model and -- we give enough commentary I think to put the pieces together. Yeah. Yeah. Thanks, Chris. Yeah, I think it's fairly similar to our view last quarter. We were pretty clear about the direct attach, which was the one-to-one you mentioned. Understanding that as you get to the upper layers of the network, there is more, and there is a range and you probably size the range. We're still I think refining our exact models there, so I don't know if I have an exact number to give you. But I think you're thinking about it the right way, starting at the direct attach and then building higher. And the second part of your question, it's all 800-gig for AI, at this point. We have strong traction on our next-generation products at 1.6T, which would be starting sometime next year. The products that are at frequencies lower than 800 gigabits are typically served for the traditional cloud infrastructure, which is also seeing a recovery as well. So, hopefully that's helpful. And Ross, maybe -- it's Matt, I'll just add. I think the -- clearly, the custom business carries a lower gross margin, we've been very open about that. But I think looking out to next year, it's a little early to call it, right? We don't know the rate of recovery for storage, that's a big part of the equation. We also have what's the -- even within like AI and cloud, what's the optics revenue going to be versus the custom stuff. You've got automotive continuing to perform well and growing, which is a higher-than-average gross margin category for us. So, we've got a lot of irons in the fire relative to various businesses that may or may not pick up at different times. As Willem said, we had a pretty consistent ability to manage gross margins in the range that we were targeting, understanding there is mix issues all the time. We've been going through a period here Q1, Q2, and Q3, where we've had it for a longer period, I'd say, unfavorable gross margin relative to our traditional mix. But it's such a dynamic environment, it's really hard to call the ball exactly, Ross, on when all those markets sort of burn through inventory, kickback back in, what is the recovery look like. But when we look at it a very high level, we continue to believe we have a very nice balanced portfolio of different products, technologies with different business models behind them that generate different gross and operating margin profiles. And as an example, like Willem said just because some of these custom programs are at lower than corporate average gross margin, especially if they ramp significantly, they are extremely accretive to operating margin and operating income at the bottom line level, which ultimately over time is what we're laser-focused on is driving earnings per share and driving operating profits for the company. So, high-level answer, but maybe it just frames it up, we need a little more time in front of us to really figure out what that looks like for next year. Sure, thanks, Vivek. It's a great question, okay, I think it's in some ways a million-dollar question. Let me tell you where we're at so far. So, obviously, Q1 was very, very low in terms of our storage revenues, and in particular, we're really talking about data center storage, if you think about it. The consumer piece is kind of hung in there because of some the specific applications we have. But that's -- what's moving the needle is the data center side. In Q2, it had recovered, which was nice to see. It was coming off a bottom, right around $100 million, let's call it, something like that. And then, from there, we said in our prepared remarks, Q3 we'd see a modest recovery again. So that would be up. It's still not sloping towards I think where we thought it was going to be a quarter or two ago relative to the year-end exit rate, and I think most of the end customer commentary suggests this is more of a first half of '24 type of recovery. But I guess the good news is, it's come off the bottom, good growth in Q2, it's going to grow again in Q3, and it will grow again in Q4. But it's just not quite at that slope and that rate. When we've dug in with the customer base kind of all the way to the end companies that consume the storage, it's hard to get an exact clear picture of where the inventory is and the timing, as I mentioned. However, what we do understand is that there's a lot of activity on qualifying the next-generation drives in technologies. There's a big TCO benefit. We haven't been able to detect anything structurally that's changed per se, although we continue to study that. So, in our mind, it looks like this has to come back to where it was at some point in terms of the number of exabytes that are being shipped or consumed, and it should grow from there for all the reasons that's been growing for the last 20 years. And AI, there was a question earlier about that, it's probably a tailwind on that. But I think with how far back we are on the supply chain, I'll just conclude my remarks by saying it's just very difficult to get a full read on where it all is, what's going on at the end customer level, and when it comes back. So, all we can do is sort of look at what our customers are saying and talking to us about and follow their lead. Hopefully, that's helpful. Yeah. Yeah, great question. Let me start with the, are they real, because I think that was the big question. Probably two quarters back, Srini, and even at the end of last year when I think the reality of the macroeconomy really hit the cloud companies pretty significantly and that's when you saw those companies at a very high level take actions on headcount, take actions on expenses, look at program priorities down at the infrastructure level. And part of our call in Q1 and Q2 was sort of advising investors how that had changed. What emerged from that was a shift from traditional cloud infrastructure to AI, now we've seen that play out through the first half of the year. So, those programs not only are getting funded there, there is extreme urgency around them. And so, now we're at a point given where these products are at, actually talking about when do we start wafers, how do we make sure the capacity is lined up, how do we have three-way calls to make sure we're all dialed-in on what's needed. So, that gives us quite a bit of comfort, and that -- and we were further along. In a quarter from now, two quarters from now, we'll be even farther along relative to being able to provide more visibility on what that ramp looks like. But we feel good about that. And certainly going through that process, we -- for all the programs in the pipeline, we have both one an open a good view of where our customers want to go. On the opportunity size, just to give you a sense, if you look at the overall Marvell's total design opportunity pipeline, the biggest segment is data center, it wouldn't surprise you, but it's a huge portion of our open funnel. And of that, we look at it every quarter the AI portion just continues to grow and has become very significant from an opportunity standpoint. And what I would say is, it's really a combination of all the technologies I mentioned in the prepared remarks, it's the PAM products going from 800 gig to 1.60T, it's our AEC offerings, it's the big custom compute silicon programs that are out there and there's a tremendous urgency to increase the beat rate on those and get them out faster. Significant interest in our Ethernet switching platform at 51.2T. Not only that, the roadmap beyond that. We have a number of new exciting technologies too like bringing silicon photonics inside the data center. So, when you think about the conversations we're having, it's just a number of technologies that really work well together. And I think customers are engaging with us now to figure out how they can get the best out of Marvell overall and really differentiate themselves within their data center architectures, on TCO, on power, on performance and using the suite of technologies and really optimizing for their architecture. So I'd say there's a number of sockets, the pipeline is big, those are all the catch-all, that sounds great. But I'd say the more strategic and interesting piece and that's where I'm spending time is really making sure we marshal the resources of Marvell to engage very deeply at the highest levels with our big cloud customers and partners in the ecosystem and present ourselves as one company with a suite of solutions that can process the data, it can move the data, it can store the data, and it can even secure the data inside your cloud. And I think all of those together is very exciting. So, yes, we'll see, lots of opportunity in front of us. I think you did a great job summarizing it. The AI piece has obviously become very meaningful and we gave a sense of what that level of revenue is going to be in the fourth quarter. So it's pretty amazing how fast that's grown obviously. But to your point, the standard cloud infrastructure side of connectivity is having a nice recovery off of some inventory that was built last year, that's now becoming a tailwind as that burns down. You pointed out that there's still a major cloud company to go through their upgrades. So that's also in front of us. As we transition each of the technologies, in terms of speed, there is always an ASP bump and it makes sense, because you're delivering, 2x bandwidth for not 2x the price, right? So, we're on a nice sort of share the benefits with our customer trajectory there. And even at 1.6T for next year while AI will lead it, right behind it, it's going to be a key part of the overall infrastructure build probably the year after. And then the regional data center stuff, which is really the ZR products, also just doing extremely well this year. I mean large upsides due to Generative AI. And then, we said in the prepared remarks and we just put out the press release, I think it was today or it was yesterday about 800ZR, and there'll be more to come on that. But there is another frequency kicker coming in probably faster than we would have thought if you went back six or nine months ago because that between data center bandwidth is actually now becoming a bottleneck. So just tremendous across-the-board opportunities that are not just AI, but it's really driving our cloud growth, and that's -- a lot of that we're seeing in the second half and we're going to see it through next year. So, we have both of those irons in the fire for Marvell overall growth. Yes. Funny way to phrase it. Yes, I think there's two aspects. I think one is, were there project reprioritization or not within those companies. And then also, is it affecting our business right now, which is kind of the two pieces. So, our view is, on the first one, at least for Marvell, I can't comment about everybody, but for us, we really worked through that issue at the end of last year, early this year. There was a big, I'd say kind of re-prioritization that went on, first, driven by the budget squeeze and companies just trying to get more efficient. And then almost in line with that was sort of the release of ChatGPT and the realization that there was this potential massive opportunity, right, for productivity gains through AI and then what are people going to do and then sort of the race was on. So, from that standpoint, we feel very good about our WIP and what we're working on and that -- at least for us, those decisions and re-prioritizations were made. And some of those are why we were lighter on our custom silicon revenue this year. We sort of talked about that a couple of quarters ago. So those programs got delayed. So, we've I guess taken some medicine on that and we moved past it, now we've got this off to the races with the AI stuff. And then, on our current business as you saw, we had -- in Q2, we had overall data center revenues up pretty nicely and that included on-prem being down, AI being up a lot, but we also said that standard cloud infrastructure was up and it's going to be up again nicely in the third quarter and it's going to continue through the fourth quarter into next year. So, I think we've worked through that as well. And probably the reason we don't get hit quite as much there is that we're tied more to the networking and connectivity than selling CPUs as an example. And so, that overall kind of network bandwidth needs to continue to get upgraded and deal with it, because a lot of these big data centers are multi-tenant and they've got AI sitting in there, and they've got specialty built servers and storage for other things, but it all needs to work together and it all needs to ultimately have the right level of bandwidth to support the compute power. So those are some puts and takes. I think the headwind on the whole thing would -- for us really would be the storage piece, which shows up in our data center near-line and that we've just been kind of -- I answered the questions about that already. So that's the puts and takes, but overall it's actually growing very nicely for us. It will be a growth driver for us next year too. Yeah. Hey, Chris, thanks for the question. Yes, I mean, it's -- enterprise on-premise business has just kept coming down. Now I think the reality is if you look at overall enterprise server shipments and you look at sort of the end data, that's probably been down for, I don't know, eight quarters or something. So, the end markets just not doing as well. It's mostly fiber channel that's within there. There's also some Ethernet and some NIC products as well. I don't know that we're necessarily calling a bottom, but it's got to be close just because at some point, people need to -- people actually need to buy servers and customers need to work through inventory. So, it's been a headwind. I think we're close to it, maybe needs a little more time, maybe another quarter. But at some point, that will renormalize as well. And it's obviously within overall data center, all of that sort of inventory adjustment and weakness at the end market levels being just blown away, obviously, by the AI and cloud infrastructure piece, which is still driving very healthy growth into Q3 and then another step-up obviously in Q4. And that's assuming really no material recovery in the on-prem side. But I do expect over time, if you just sort of step back and look at like fiber channel, it's been a pretty stable business for us, ever since we've owned it through the Cavium acquisition. And we don't see any reason why, at some point, that just doesn't come back to where it was. And when it does that, that will also be a positive thing for us. Hopefully, that's helpful. Yeah, maybe the simple answer is, first of all, as you point out, we're agnostic. We participate broadly in the connectivity independent of whether it's InfiniBand or Ethernet. And I'd say that we continue to have very high market share and penetration into both those applications. And the demand we're seeing is broad-based from both of those as well as multiple customers driving it. So, it's actually really kind of hard to break it down exactly. And I don't know that it's super helpful, because overall, the shares still very healthy, and we're agnostic. So, the same module can kind of be used in either one. Yes, I think we'll have some contribution from that product area next year. The bigger ramp is a little bit further out. But very pleased, I'd say, with the open funnel on that technology. I'm very happy with the team. I mean this -- the architecture and the key pieces of that initially came from Innovium, right, which is a company we acquired in 2021. But the thing that we did upfront is we put it on the Marvell 5-nanometer design flow using our SerDes, our IP platform, our new product development process. So you kind of got the best of both worlds and teams executed extremely well on the chip. And as a result, it's giving customers confidence we can really be there for them not only on the feature set, including very, very low latency and in the right power envelope, but also being able to manufacture for high volume, which is no small task on these effectively reticle buster type switches or type products. So we'll see how it goes, Quinn, but pipeline is strong. This is going to be a big upgrade cycle for the industry. And I think it's going to be overall positive for the people that are in that ecosystem. I think we'll do one -- perfect, Quinn. And I think we'll do, Gary, one more question, and then we can wrap it. Okay. Willem, you want to go? Then, I'll go. Yeah. And then on the revenue side, Gary, it's been my experience doing this for a long time and having the famous 14-week quarter roll through, it's -- I think the best practice I found is, you end up really not getting the extra revenue per se, but you got to obviously count the expenses. So that's sort of the way to think about it. So, we don't -- we're not saying, hey, because Q4 is 14 weeks, we're going to have some better growth than we would have. I think it's just -- that's kind of what the market is doing. So the -- and then Willem gave you sort of the run rate on OpEx. If you look at it, netting out what 13 weeks would have been, which is about $420 million. Yeah."

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, this event is being recorded today. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ashish Saran, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please, go ahead.\nAshish Saran: Thank you, and good afternoon everyone. Welcome to Marvell's first fiscal quarter 2024 earnings call. Joining me today are Matt Murphy, Marvell's President and CEO; and Willem Meintjes, our CFO. Let me remind everyone that certain comments made today include forward-looking statements, which are subject to significant risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from management's current expectations. Please review the cautionary statements and risk factors contained in our earnings press release, which we filed with the SEC today and posted on our website, as well as our most recent 10-K and 10-Q filings. We do not intend to update our forward-looking statements. During our call today, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation between our GAAP and non-GAAP financial measure is available in the Investor Relations section of our website. With that, I'll turn the call over to Matt for his comments on our performance. Matt?\nMatt Murphy: Thanks Ashish, and good afternoon everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Marvell's revenue was 1.322 billion, above the midpoint of guidance. Higher revenue drove our non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.31, $0.02 above the mid-point. We were guiding revenue for the second quarter to go to 133 billion at the mid-point and expect sequential revenue growth will accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year. Before we get to our results for each end market, let me start by discussing the tremendous opportunity that AI represents for Marvell. In the past, we considered AI to be one of many applications within cloud, but its importance and therefore the opportunity has increased dramatically. Generative AI is rapidly driving new applications and changing the investment priorities for our cloud customers. Today's AI workloads require truly massive datasets. To efficiently process this data, the architecture for AI data centers is significantly different than standard cloud infrastructure. Rather than dual socket servers at the core element in Iraq, the primary building block in AI is a system containing multiple accelerators such as GPUs. In large deployments, thousands of these systems are interconnected to form a data center sized AI cluster, and what's required to interconnect these systems is orders of magnitude higher than in standard cloud infrastructure. To give you an idea, the latest dual CPU server in the cloud data center today can drive up to 200 gigabits per second of IO and contains the network interfaces to support that bandwidth. In contrast, an example of an advanced AI system containing 8 accelerators can drive close to 30 terabits of full duplex bandwidth. As hundreds of times more bandwidth required to connect these systems together, keep in mind, [meeting cloud data] [ph] centers connect thousands of these systems in a single cluster to provide maximum scalability for their customers with each of these systems capable of driving tens of terabits of network traffic. And in order to create the largest possible cluster sizes at data center scale, these connections need to be able to operate over increasingly long distances. These clusters require a staggering amount of high bandwidth connectivity, all of which needs to be provided at ultra-low latency and high reliability. And within a reasonable power outlook. This connectivity is best provided by fully optically connected infrastructure, utilizing digital signal processing and low latency high capacity fabric switches. This is why we see AI as a strong growth driver for our PAM4 optical DSP platform. And it is important to note that these DSPs are compatible with a variety of network protocols such as Ethernet, InfiniBand, and other proprietary solutions for maximum breadth and flexibility. Going forward, we see this trend only accelerating. While today's most advanced AI systems are already using the highest bandwidth interfaces available, it might surprise you to learn that the performance scale of current AI implementations are still constrained by network capacity. Take the [8 accelerator] [ph] AI system I discussed earlier, for example. Those systems today typically contain four 800 gigabit per second optical interfaces for external connectivity, which provide an aggregate of 3.2 terabits per second of bandwidth. But that is in a system capable of driving close to 10x that bandwidth. To bridge this gap, we expect that the number of optical interfaces per AI system to continue to grow as these clusters scale. And the next generation of accelerators are expected to have even more compute capability and higher bandwidth requirements. Given the speed at which AI infrastructure is advancing, the technology refresh rate is happening at 18 months to 24 months versus 4 plus years in standard infrastructure. Altogether, we expect a massive amount of connectivity in these AI clusters, increasing adoption of higher speed optical interfaces, and faster refresh rates to be a major demand drivers for our PAM4 DSP platform. In fact, in our last earnings call, we indicated that the ramp in our industry leading 800 gig DSP platform was driven almost entirely by AI applications. We have also announced the industry's first 1.6 terabit PAM4 DSP platform, doubling the throughput from the current generation, and we expect AI to drive the initial adoption of these products as well. In addition, as inference is deployed at multiple regional data centers, they need to be connected by high bandwidth low latency optical links over tens of kilometers. This technology has noticed data center interconnect or DCI, and Marvell has been a pioneer in this market. We created the industry's first pluggable module for DCI, and we are now providing 400 gigabits per second in our latest DCI product line. We already seen that AI cloud data centers are driving a significant increase in demand for 400 ZR solution. Another demand driver for our DCI products is that the next generation AI implementations are planning on clustering accelerators across different sites. AI is also a key growth driver of demand for switching inside the data center. Marvell has a growing position in the market for low latency high capacity switches, and we are seeing strong demand for our products. We recently announced our next generation 51.2T Teralynx 10 ethernet switching platform. Platform is based on the low latency architecture we acquired from Innovium and is built on Marvell's leading 5 nanometer technology platform. We are seeing strong interest for this product. We expect AI to lead the industry's transition from today's 12.8T switches to 51.2T enabling a quadrupling and network bandwidth. We expect 51.2T adoption will be a strong growth driver for the networking semiconductor market. Putting it all together, Marvell has built both a leading position and network connectivity for AI. We expect tremendous growth for our PAM4 optics DCI and Ethernet switching solutions fueled by the growing investment in AI. Perhaps even more exciting is Marvell's opportunity to address compute in AI through our cloud optimized silicon platform. As you heard earlier, the architecture of an AI data center is fundamentally different. In standard cloud infrastructure, the bulk of the compute is performed by CPUs, while accelerators are primarily used for off-load tasks, such as networking and security. In contrast in AI infrastructure, accelerators like GPUs are the primary compute engines, while CPUs are used for control purposes, a 180 degree reversal from standard cloud infrastructure. Fundamental difference results in a higher ratio of accelerators to CPUs and AI with accelerators now to dominate compute opportunity. This combined with the sharp increase in AI investment is driving a higher proportion of the incremental compute [PAM] [ph] in cloud data centers towards accelerators. Today, we see cloud customers enhancing their AI offerings by building custom accelerators of their own designed to address their specific needs. This is a core part of Marvell's cloud optimized silicon strategy, and we now see a much larger and faster growing opportunity for custom compute and AI infrastructure. When we previously discussed our cloud optimized silicon opportunities and revenue ramp expectations at our Investor Day in October 2021, we projected revenue from the first set of design wins to grow to $800 million annually once all the programs were in production. These designs included a variety of accelerated computing applications including AI, security, storage, and video along with several networking applications. When we look today at the same set of design wins, driven by AI, our total lifetime revenue expectations from these have increased significantly. Same time, the relative proportion of projected lifetime revenue from AI has increased from approximately 20% in our prior forecast to well over half today. As a result, computing and AI applications has now grown to become the single largest revenue driver and opportunity for Marvell's cloud optimized silicon platform. The continuing increase in demand from AI, we see annual revenue from those same set of cloud optimized design wins, well exceeding the prior 800 million projection as these programs ramp over time. In fact, we have a number of custom silicon products tied to AI expected to ramp into volume production next year. As an example for one of these programs, initial samples are already up and running at our customer's lab and qualification is proceeding well. And in other case, we expect to take out this quarter and deliver first silicon before the end of the calendar year. As you can see, in addition to our strong position in network connectivity for AI, we believe we are well-positioned to address the compute opportunity. Over the last few months, we have taken time and carefully map our revenue from AI so we can track its progress over time. Given the tremendous progress we've made, including the recent demand increases from our customers, we are expecting our revenue driven by AI applications to grow at an accelerated pace. In fiscal 2023, we estimate that our AI revenue was approximately 200 million, up dramatically from the prior year. This revenue was primarily from our PAM4 optics and 400ZR DCI products. Since our last earnings call in early March, bookings for these products have increased very significantly. As a result, we expect Marvell's overall AI revenue to at least double in fiscal 2024. Looking to fiscal 2025, we expect robust growth to continue from AI for network connectivity. Layering on top of this is the growth we expect from the ramp of the cloud optimized programs we discussed earlier in the call. In aggregate, we foresee our overall AI revenue to at least double again next year. In other words, we are forecasting an AI revenue growth CAGR over 100% over the fiscal 2023 to 2025 time frame. In the future, we expect generative AI implementations involving video and images to provide a tailwind to overall storage and exabyte growth, both in HDD and Flash. However, it is difficult to accurately allocate revenue from our storage business specifically to AI. So, the AI revenue forecast I just discussed does not include any storage contributions. In addition, we expect the increase in network traffic from AI will also provide a tailwind for our broader networking portfolio over time, which we have not yet captured in our AI revenue forecast. We've seen rapid shifts in our cloud customers plan to spending on AI infrastructures becoming a much bigger portion of their CapEx. We believe that Marvell is one of a scarce few semiconductor companies positioned to enable this trend and is uniquely able to participate in all three aspects of AI systems, networking, compute, and storage. We set out in 2016 to pivot Marvell to data infrastructure and have successfully executed that strategy, forming the right team, technology, and customer relationships to lead in this market. With AI becoming the ultimate data infrastructure application, Marvell is at the center of this incredible transformation. We are confident that we will be one of the most relied on semiconductor companies to help our customers achieve their vision. We look forward to sharing our continued progress in AI in the future. Let me move on now to reviewing our results and expectations by end market starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the first quarter was 436 million, declining 32% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Our overall data center revenue in the first quarter was higher than guidance driven by cloud where we saw stronger demand for our optical data center interconnect products from expanding AI deployments. As expected, storage was responsible for the majority of the overall sequential decline in our data center revenue in the first quarter, although we are forecasting sequential growth to start in the second quarter and our data center storage business continue to grow in the second half. Looking ahead to the second quarter for our overall data center end market, we expect cloud revenue to grow over 10% sequentially. However, we are expecting the enterprise on-premise portion of our data center end market to decline an offset growth from cloud. As a result, we expect revenue from our overall data center end market to be flat sequentially in the second quarter. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market, revenue for the first quarter was 290 million growing 15% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. We saw strong demand for our wireless products, as 5G adoption continued to expand in new geographic regions along with our customer specific product ramps. This resulted in approximate 25% sequential growth in wireless revenue. Partially offsetting our wireless growth was the start of inventory digestion in our wired end market. Moving on to our outlook for the next quarter, we expect revenue from our overall carrier end market to decline in the mid-single-digits sequentially, due to continued inventory digestion in our wired end market. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the first quarter was 365 million, growing 27% year-over-year and flat sequentially, which is better than our guidance. Our first quarter enterprise networking results reflected a strong ramp in custom ASICs offset by our planned reduction in channel and customer inventory of our merchant products. Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we project our enterprise networking revenue to decline by more than 10% sequentially, due to inventory corrections in this end market. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market, revenue in the first quarter was 89 million, flat year-over-year and declining 10% sequentially. While our automotive business continues to deliver strong growth both year-over-year and sequentially, these gains were offset by a decline in our industrial business. Looking to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we project revenue from our auto and industrial end market to grow sequentially in the low teens on a percentage basis. Moving on to our consumer end market, revenue for the first quarter was 142 million below our guidance declining 20% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we are forecasting revenue to grow sequentially in the mid-30% range, driven by strong seasonal growth in demand for our custom SSD controllers. In addition, we are expecting growth from our ACD controllers as we start shipping closer to end market consumption. In summary, we are guiding sequential growth to resume starting with the second quarter and we expect growth will accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year. Few markets remain choppy and we expect revenue from our wired and enterprise end markets to continue to trend down due to macroeconomic uncertainty and inventory corrections. We expect revenue from our wireless end market to step-up in the third quarter before taking a pause and declining in the fourth quarter. We see many positive signs in our data center end markets. We are forecasting our data center storage revenue to resume growth in the second quarter and continue to improve as we start shipping closer to end market demand. Putting aside storage, we expect cloud to be the key growth driver for our data center revenue. We are guiding our cloud revenue to grow over 10% sequentially in the second quarter, and we are seeing a significant increase in demand from AI for the rest of the year. In addition, we expect our cloud optimized silicon programs to ramp more meaningfully as the year progresses, in-line with the revised expectations we outlined during last quarter's call. As a result, we are confident in our expectations for higher growth for the company in the second half of the year. We also expect to drive significant margin improvement going forward. We anticipate that inventory corrections will be mostly behind us by the end of this year, and we are excited about the resumption of revenue growth driven by Marvell's specific product ramps. We have been laser focused on a number of cost improvement actions to improve gross margin. As a result, we have confidence in our forecast for our non-GAAP gross margin to return to at least the low-end of our target range in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. We've been in extensive discussions with our customers and have a clear view of their current road maps. While some programs have been pushed out, others have been accelerated. We are aggressively reprioritizing our investments, aligning to the highest ROI opportunities in front of us. We are also focused on driving additional efficiency to further reduce our operating expenses. We are making strategic road map adjustments and combining some of our businesses to reflect changes in the market. As an example, resulting from our customers' growing needs for custom compute, we've combined our custom ASIC and processor product groups into a single organization. Other teams are also working on efficiency improvements. As a result, we expect our OpEx to exit at a lower run rate than previously communicated. This discipline on expenses is expected to carry into fiscal 2025 and help us to deliver strong operating leverage going forward. Willem will provide more details in his commentary. Before closing, I'd like to express my appreciation to Rick Hill, who will be retiring from the Marvell Board at the end of his current term. Rick joined Marvell a little over 7 years ago as Chairman of the Board and acting CEO during a very difficult time. He moved quickly to stabilize the company, personally reassuring customers, employees, and shareholders. He helped establish a world-class board of directors and was instrumental in the recruiting of the first key group of executives. I joined Marvell in large part because of Rick. It is very rare to find an individual who is willing to contribute their time and energy and impart their wisdom to others for the satisfaction of seeing a company thrive and the next generation leaders succeed. At the most critical moments over the past 7 years, Rick always had the Marvell teams back and his belief in the team enabled us to take bold steps to transform the company. Without his leadership and mentorship, Marvell would not be where it is today. I'm truly grateful to Rick for his exceptional contributions to Marvell, and it's an honor for me to succeed him as Board Chair. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to Dr. Ed Frank, who joined us from the Cavium Board in 2018. Ed has been an outstanding director and will be retiring for the Marvell Board when his term expires in June. I'm grateful to Ed for his years of dedicated service to Marvell. Finally, I want to thank our dedicated team of employees. Together, we are moving forward with confidence that Marvell's best days are yet to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook.\nWillem Meintjes: Thanks Matt, and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue in the first quarter was 1.322 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance declining 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Data center was our largest end market driving 33% of total revenue. Enterprise networking was the next largest with 27% of total revenue followed by carrier infrastructure at 22%, consumer at 11%, and auto industrial at 7%. GAAP gross margin was 42.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60% in-line with guidance. Our gross margin results reflected the adverse revenue mix we had forecasted for this first quarter. GAAP operating expenses were 740 million, including share based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs related to headcount reductions, and acquisition related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 459 million, slightly below guidance. First quarter operating expenses reflected the step-up from the prior quarter, due to typical seasonality and payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases. GAAP operating margin was negative 13.8%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25.3%. For the first quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.20. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.31, $0.02 above the midpoint of guidance. Now, turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was 208 million. This included 40 million in payments for previously committed long-term capacity payments. Looking ahead, we are currently anticipating minimal additional payments for capacity for the rest of fiscal 2024 and beyond. As a result, we expect a much reduced headwind to operating cash flow as compared to fiscal 2023, where payments for long-term capacity totaled approximately 250 million. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was 1.03 billion, decreasing by 42 million sequentially. Our days sales outstanding was 69 days, a decrease of 7 days from the prior quarter. We returned 51 million to shareholders through cash dividends. As of the end of the fiscal first quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were 1.03 billion, almost all of which is held in systemically important banks. Our total debt was 4.68 billion, which included a drawdown of 200 million from our revolving line of credit. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.1x and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. Before I provide specific guidance for the second quarter, let me describe our plan for gross margin, operating expenses, and capital allocation for the rest of the year. As you are aware, significant inventory corrections in certain businesses caused an adverse revenue mix, which impacted our gross margin. We are optimistic that inventory corrections will be largely done by the fourth quarter and that we will be shipping closer to end demand at that time. We have also put in place multiple cost reduction efforts to improve gross margin. Internally, we are optimizing headcount and further streamlining operations. Externally, we continue to partner with our strategic suppliers to drive more efficiency in the supply chain. We are confident that as a result of mix improvement and our cost reduction efforts, our non-GAAP gross margin will start to improve. We expect modest improvement in the third quarter and by the fourth quarter, we can return to at least the low-end of our target range of 64% to 66%. As Matt told you, we are making strategic road map adjustments and driving additional efficiencies all whilst maintaining our long-term growth outlook. As a result, we expect to reduce our non-GAAP operating expense in the fourth quarter to be approximately 430 million. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 is a 14-week quarter. So, included in this forecast is approximately 10 million in expenses for the extra week. Therefore, on a normalized 13-week basis, we expect the run rate for our non-GAAP OpEx exiting this year to be 420 million. As we look ahead to fiscal 2025, we expect that typical seasonality and payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases in the first quarter will cause OpEx to step-up sequentially. As a result, we are modeling first quarter fiscal 2025 OpEx to increase sequentially by mid-to-high single-digits on a percentage basis from the normalized 13-week exit rate of 420 million in the prior quarter. We are confident that this sets us up to drive tremendous operating leverage next year. In terms of capital allocation, we have 500 million of our total debt due in January 2023 that we are planning on paying off using our cash balance and free cash flow. This will improve our gross leverage meaningfully going forward. Following this payoff, we expect to resume our buyback program in the third quarter. Turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of 1.33 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 44.3% to 46.8%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 60% to 61%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 694 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 455 million. We expect other income and expense, including interest on our debt to be approximately 51 million. For the second quarter, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 7%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 861 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 865 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.16 per share on the low-end to an income of $0.05 per diluted share on the high-end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.27 to $0.37. In summary, as we move forward through this fiscal year, we project our revenue to continue to grow sequentially, gross margin to improve significantly in the fourth quarter, and operating expenses to continue to step down. Our DSO and inventory have already shown signs of improvement. As a result, we are looking forward to driving tremendous operating leverage and significant improvement in cash flow generation over this year, while setting up a strong platform for growth next year. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today's first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nRoss Seymore: Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. It sounds like things have changed significantly since your last call, Matt. You went through the AI side in great details and then the cyclical side sounds like it's bottoming. I just wanted to have you dive into a little bit about the customer behavior. Is it just the cycle side that you find the bottom on finally? Is it the AI side that's really accelerating? Just talk about how that behavior has changed over the course of your quarter if you could, please?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Hey, Ross. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think it's encouraging to see revenue growth in the second quarter. So overall, with the total company revenue bottoming and then encouraging to see cloud pick back up, growing sequentially in Q2, you know, 10%, kind of plus, and that's driven by AI. So that's certainly been a positive. I think, maybe I'll just talk about the rest of the business. There's a number of moving pieces. A lot of it barely pretty much came in line in terms of things like carrier, automotive, etcetera. So, we haven't seen a ton of behavior change there. Really the biggest change, I would say is that, the \u2013 I think two things related to AI. The first is just the level of bookings, backlog, forecast increase, particularly for our optical products has increased significantly. That's a positive. The second is that we really took the time between last quarter and this quarter to, in a very detailed manner, quantify our AI revenue stream, where it was coming from, what's driving it. We now have it actually embedded in our system as a separate end market that we can filter by. So, we have a good view of the history, a good view of the future. And we definitely wanted to take the time so that when we communicated numbers, they were rock solid. And what you're seeing is a really positive story, which is basically, you know, around a $200 million level of revenue for AI last year. And then, you know, at least what we see is doubling this year and then at least doubling again next year. So, that's probably been the single biggest change. I'd say, just the uptick in AI, which was a little bit behind some of the announcements maybe going on last quarter, but it's definitely here for us. And I'd say the broader cloud infrastructure side, non-AI is also picking up and will also grow in the second quarter and grow throughout the year and actually has a great set-up for next year as well. So, those are some of the things that have gone on. And just one final note on the AI stuff, we \u2013 I said in my prepared remarks, but just for everybody on the call, we deliberately don't include storage at this time in AI. We found it pretty difficult to map that particular set of products, you know, directly to AI systems or not. Clearly, there's going to be a tailwind for that business over time just given the amount of data that's going to need to get stored. But so really what you're seeing is, I think a very clean and very exciting AI number.\nRoss Seymore: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.\nTimothy Arcuri: Hi, thanks. I'm kind of wondering if you can frame, Matt, how much you think revenue is going to start to grow in the back half of the year. There's kind of a lot of moving parts wired and enterprise business are still digesting inventory. Data center is going to be up in the back half of the year. It sounds like that's due to cloud and there is some storage coming back as well. But many of the big networking OEMs are still sitting on record inventories, Cisco, Arista, you know Juniper. So, can you just sort of frame how much you think revenue can grow as you get into fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4? Is it reasonable to expect, kind of mid-single digits or even better for each of those quarters? Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Hey, Tim. So, I\u2019d just give you some data, sort of what way to think about it. I think first is, we just start with the second quarter. Okay. So, we're seeing sequential growth. And again, when you look at the data center piece. The cloud growth is being offset by continued weakness in on-prem enterprise. And as you've noted, that's clearly been an issue for, kind of the overall server market the last probably five quarters, if you kind of take the read-through to enterprise networking, same thing. There's a lot of inventory on the customer balance sheet. So, we have signaled for some time. We expect that that continues to correct throughout the year. I think what I'd really point you to is, the company has inflected back-up in terms of growth in Q2. And as we look out, you know, even beyond the second half. I mean, if you just kind of look into the next year, we have the AI doubling again, you know, at least in our fiscal 2025. We see strong continued growth in our cloud infrastructure. So, non-AI the cloud, also driving meaningful growth. That's both growth and optics, as well as storage coming back, as well as some cloud optimized programs. So, that's a positive. Automotive continues to grow next year. And then as you as you indicated, you know, storage is still very low. It's come off the bottom in our guide for Q2, but should be back, you know, next year. So, lot of very strong growth drivers. So, you need to kind of draw a line between the first half now and next year. And I think the way you're thinking about it is the right, which is some of the markets are going to be choppier like enterprise. And we also said that in carrier, we've had this incredible run in our 5G wireless business over the last several years. We actually see that continue in Q2 and Q3, but probably in the fourth quarter is where that will drop off after a long run. It just \u2013 we've got our own product cycles going, but that gets more than offset, obviously, by all the growth in data center. So, great set-up for the second half. Really Cloud AI driven and would more than offset any, kind of comprehensive weakness or choppiness in some of the other end markets. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nTimothy Arcuri : Thanks, Matt. So, I guess, you don't you don't want to put a number on it. So, like, mid-single-digits, you don't\u2026\nMatt Murphy: We don't, yeah. We\u2019re not yet. And the bottom line is, we're not \u2013 like most companies, we're not going to guide the second half specifically at this point, but clearly going to accelerate off of where we are today.\nTimothy Arcuri: Perfect. Okay, Matt. Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Yes.\nOperator: The next question is from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Please go ahead.\nVivek Arya: Thanks for the question. Matt, I just wanted to understand what specifically is included in AI this year. I think you're suggesting about 400 million or so in terms of a double from last year. How much of that is your electro optics, are you including the Innovium switches and that, what about your cloud optimized silicon, where I think the number was 200 million for this year? So, what exactly is included in AI for this year? And when you spoke about the potential for it to double again next year, of those three pieces, are all three going to double, is one going to grow more? So, just if you could give us a little more clarity around what exactly is included in AI for this year and among that, what will grow next year?\nMatt Murphy: Yeah. Great question, Vivek. So, when you think about this year, it's \u2013 we said it's, you know, at least doubling. So, think of it as 400 plus and it wants to be more, by the way, and we're working on that. That is almost, you know, almost completely driven by our PAM4 optics, PAM4 DSP, as well as some of the DCI stuff that's driving a lot of AI traffic and regional data center. So, think of it as mostly driven by optics. Some networking as you point out and probably a little bit of cloud optimized, but think of it as mostly just really strong 800 gig ramp that we're seeing in PAM4. That continues into next year, but then we layer in the cloud optimized ramps as well. And so both of those contribute to the incremental growth and the, sort of over doubling into the next year. And as we get through the year Vivek, we'll be able to quantify this a little bit more. I mean, you can imagine how fast things are moving in this area. It's incredibly dynamic, it's incredibly exciting, and positive. And I'd say almost on a daily or every other day basis, there's, sort of new positive incremental updates. So, as we go forward, we'll share more, but think of it really this year as the PAM4 train running very strong into next year, and then we start layering and the cloud optimized on top of it. And as we said in the prepared remarks, I think what's really exciting is those wins we articulated several years ago, right at our 2021 Analyst Day. So, these are products we've been working on for some time now. And, you know, normally, products take about 18 months to 24 months to develop and then a period of time to ramp. So, next year, the timing looks really good.\nVivek Arya: Sorry, Matt. On this cloud optimize, is it still 200 million for this year, so partially in AI? And then what is the number for cloud optimized for next year?\nMatt Murphy: Sure. So, what we said, what I said, and there was a lot in the detail, but we reconfirmed we're tracking to the number we gave you guys last time, which was the 200 million. I'd say, it is potentially higher, but I think that's a safe number. And then at a high level, I think, just given how dynamic the situation is, we're not guiding a specific number for next year. But what we did say is, the original, sort of estimate back in, when we gave it at the at the Analyst Day in 2021 it was that you have, you know, 800 million and kind of the fiscal 2025 to 2026 time frame. And then what I updated on the call was that that peak revenue was actually going to exceed the 800 million, just given that the total lifetime volume now of those same design wins has actually increased pretty significantly. And then the percentage of those has moved meaningfully towards AI. So, it's all tracking in the right direction for this year and then for next year we'll see how it goes. You know, I really don't want to cap it quite frankly, and it's too early to even call a number.\nVivek Arya: Understood. Thank you, Matt.\nOperator: The next question is from Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Please go ahead.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Hi. Thank you very much. That's a lot of very helpful details there, Matt. I actually wanted to turn on to Willem on the gross margin side. So, what are the assumptions for the fourth quarter, because you guys sound very, I don't know if it\u2019s the right word, convicted about hitting that in the fourth quarter? So, just kind of help us understand the assumptions, how much of it is \u2013 some of it has to be based on the top line recovery as well, right? So, just give us confidence on that, please.\nWillem Meintjes: Yes. Ambrish, thanks for the question. So, yes, we're very confident on getting back to the bottom end of our range in Q4. Some of the main drivers, I think, as Matt pointed out, that wireless carrier, we expect that to continue to be really strong through the third quarter and then really to take a step down in Q4. We've seen the storage recovery starting, and we expect that to continue through the fourth quarter. And then, I'd also point to the optical products and by AI. We're seeing that strength pick up through the year. And all of those are very much accretive to our gross margin. But then in addition to that, all the OpEx reduction initiatives that we're driving internally, as well as the work that we're doing with our supply chain. We expect all that to really more meaningfully impact our P&L in Q4. So, that gives us confidence. Hopefully, that would clarify. Thank you.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Yes. So, just a clarification because tied to that, you said the inventory would be largely over excess inventory. So, it sounds like on the cloud side that is behind us. And is it fair to assume that networking is where the vestiges remain towards the end of the year? Matt, is that the right way to think about it in terms of excess inventory?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. I think I would \u2013 well, let me clarify one thing. I'd say, we're not completely out of the woods yet on cloud. So, I'd say the \u2013 think of it as the 10% sequential growth, which is really positive, by the way. We're happy to see that inflect back up. The way to kind of think about it is the AI portion of it is moving up quite dramatically, as you can imagine. But the traditional infrastructure side is also going up, but it\u2019s still got a little bit to clear. So, actually, I'd say there's a little bit more tailwind there in terms of inventory digestion on the cloud side, which would be, kind of additional stuff. So that would kick in. And then storage is still \u2013 we're still way under shipping demand. So that will be a positive exiting the year. And then, yes, you're right, like we took some actions in enterprise on our own, some in Q1 that didn't quite get it all done. So, we're getting it all \u2013 the rest of it done in Q2. These are more us driving it in terms of working inventory down, so that when we exit the year, it's more rebalanced. So, there's a few pockets where there's still some inventory overhang, obviously, something like an AI is not, and then wireless 5G, I mean that just stepped up 25% sequentially. So, we've been shipping pretty hard on that one. But yes, there's a few pieces. But when you kind of add it all up, we see across the board, we should be in pretty good shape in terms of shipping back to what normalized demand would be. And that was really Willem's point, it\u2019s just some of these product lines that just when they come back to normal shipping to demand run rate, it's definitely a tailwind for gross margin. And then, of course, on top of that, we have our own programs we're driving to ensure our success to get the gross margins back up.\nAmbrish Srivastava: Got it. Thank you. Super helpful.\nOperator: The next question is from Blayne Curtis with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks for taking the question. Matt, I just wanted to go to some of your AI comments, I thought it was super interesting. You talked about the mix of lifetime revenue moving from 20% to 50%. And you also gave us that extra year. But I'm just trying to understand, have you seen an influx of new projects that you've started that would then come out then? I mean you're giving us an extra view, so maybe some of this was in the works before? And then I guess, kind of just conceptually why that mix kind of shifted so much? I mean, it would suggest a pretty high percentage of your out-year there. So, just kind of curious how all this unfolds over the last quarter?\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Well, I think, Blayne, there's kind of a couple of pieces to that. So, the first is, we had an initial set of design wins that we sized and articulated at the October 2021 Investor Day. And that was this $400 million going to $800 million. And as you pointed out, roughly 20% of that lifetime revenue at the time was for AI, 80% was sort of for traditional cloud infrastructure. And then now we've seen, sort of the AI piece really take-off in terms of expectations for it. So, that \u2013 just to clarify, that is just going apples-to-apples with what we communicated two years ago. I mean \u2013 and those are the projects now that are coming to fruition. But I mean, just to be very clear, since that time, we have layered in a significant number of incremental new design wins. And those are \u2013 many of those are now underway, probably not as much revenue from those next year, but then those would be, sort of the year after. And I would just also add that our design win funnel, and this is data I was just reviewing at the company level, who's just expanded dramatically with the biggest portion of that coming from our cloud design win funnel. And then of the cloud, you can imagine the AI portion has become very significant versus where it was 2 or 3 years ago. So, I'd say on a number of aspects, wins we claimed 2 years ago go into production. Incremental activity and wins since then, so that would indicate long-term even a higher number in terms of our AI potential. And then the funnel looks extremely robust. And so that all leads to a, I think, a very bright outlook in terms of where this can go over the next 5 to 7 years depending on how long it takes to, sort of flow all these through. So, we're in the very early innings here, Blayne, I think, as you can imagine.\nBlayne Curtis: Thanks for that. I just want to follow up on the carrier side. I think in the past, you talked about maybe India would be that source of growth. I think you're now saying after a bunch of quarters of growth, maybe it would be down a bit. I\u2019m just trying to understand, did something change in your expectation for that India rollout or is it just the softness in the inventory with the other regions?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, I think, Blayne, the way to think about it is, generally, I'd say, this has been our story for 5G as it's unfolded over the last, call it, 3 years. It's grown virtually almost every quarter. And if you look at where we were coming off of last year, we were pretty excited, right? We hit kind of the $600 million bogey we had talked about. And then we had to step up big time in Q1 of 25% sequential off of Q4, which we said is going to continue actually in Q2 and probably remain strong through Q3. So, at some point, this base station market is pretty lumpy, especially the deployment. There's a lot of concern around CapEx out there. Some people have already, sort of seen it, but given that we're mostly in new products, and we don't have a lot of 4G overhang, we've been able to power through. But yes, I think the India stuff is definitely comprehended in this 25% step-up we already took and then really three very strong quarters this year before we see a drop off in Q4. And then sometime in next year, we'll have some growth again at some point. But it's been running pretty hot. And I think we've been pretty much way outperforming in terms of what other people are seeing in the telecom market.\nOperator: The next question is from Tore Svanberg with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nTore Svanberg: Yes, thank you and congrats on turning around the ship here. I had a question about storage, Matt. So, I know it's hard for you to identify how much was related to AI and you, kind of don't want to give a number going forward either. But as we start to think about CXL, especially because now that there's, you know AI is driving some pull-in on some of these next-generation technologies, I would think that that could be already an opportunity for you next year. So, any color you can give us on how big the storage business could be in AI over the next few years?\nMatt Murphy: Got it. Yes. Tore, you bring up a very good point. So, when I referred to storage earlier, it was really on the existing product lines we have, which is primarily hard disk drive controllers, preamplifiers, and flash controllers. And that one, we just \u2013 we tried. We spent a lot of time on it over the last 3 months, trying to map it and ultimately, we just said, let's keep it out for now. But you have a very good point in that, something I haven't talked about, which is there's going to be a tremendous demand for CXL in these large systems, especially as the DRAM and the memory really needs to scale pretty dramatically. And we are seeing strong pull from customers on those solutions and kind of the lead product we're doing is under a lot of scheduled pressure to get it out because of the need. So, I think that's another leg to the stool. That's not really in our, kind of comprehended in our next year numbers per se, but it's definitely out there. And I think that's going to drive a whole other segment for us. I'd also say there's things like AECs, which is another product category that we've invested in that's getting extremely strong traction, very happy with the progress there. That's something that can layer in again over time. So, there's a few other shots on goal we have that really leverage the core DSP and analog mixed signal capability we have inside of Marvell. And we're going to continue to try to leverage those and really be as broad-based as a supplier as we can. And again, and if you think about, sort of all the [hops] [ph], all the data hops that are coming in and out of these systems, we want to be the lead company that our customers go to for these solutions, whether it's CXL, ACs, PAM4 DSP, optics, DCI. And then, of course, the more exciting, not more but has exciting opportunity in the custom silicon area. So, a lot of stuff going on.\nTore Svanberg: Great perspective. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from C.J. Muse with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nC.J. Muse: Yes. Good afternoon and thank you for taking the question. A follow-up question on storage and really trying to think through the ramp in the second half, both for data center and consumer. For data center, I think that business was probably down $150 million peak to trough, just for the controller side. And so, curious how we should think about that step-up into October and January? And then the same thing on the consumer side, that business is up, I think, implied about $50 million sequentially in July. Is that sustainable into the second half of the year? Thanks so much.\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Let me take it in two pieces. So, on the data center side, it did bottom out in Q1. So, it will be up a little bit in Q2, but more \u2013 it will kind of grow throughout the year, but really I don't think it recovers \u2013 and even if it doesn't recover all the way, it recovers mostly probably by the fourth quarter, C.J., the January quarter, not the third quarter. But it will \u2013 think of Q1 and Q2 as being very, very low. And then it comes back in the second half step-up in Q3 and then in Q4. And we're really not modeling it at this point even in Q4 getting back up to like 100% of where it was.  I think, we're probably at 75% to 80%, just in our own models, just to be conservative. But certainly, over time, that should normalize. So that's the data center one. The good news is, it's come off the bottom and it's growing in Q2 and will get better in the second half. On the consumer side, yes, this is not a super strategic end market for us. There's some moving pieces. Q1, if you looked at, it was a little bit low, Q2 has got this kind of funky 30% growth. That's on the flash side, kind of normalize those two. It's probably in the range of where it should be. Just the way to think about overall consumer is, it's actually outperformed if you went back to, kind of our Investor Day model a few years ago, it\u2019s seen a lot of strength. But at some point, it's going to \u2013 and our model was always to trend down over time. I would say that probably starts in the second half and continues through next year. And look, if we get a bluebird, that's great. You never know, we got a lot of bluebirds over the last few years. But just given we don't put a lot of R&D behind it, the way to think about consumer is you got Q1 and Q2, just assume the second half is probably lower and then it just trends down over time, more in-line with what we talked about at the Investor Day model. Hopefully, that's helpful.\nC.J. Muse: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Karl Ackerman with BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.\nKarl Ackerman: Thank you. Gentlemen, I was wondering how much of the uptick in your data center business outlook is coming from the expanded TAM opportunity from a competitor exiting investment of their networking ASIC division where your Innovium business competes quite well?\nMatt Murphy: Oh, I see. Yes, you're talking about the switching portfolio, Karl?\nKarl Ackerman: Correct.\nMatt Murphy: Yes. Okay. No, I would say, definitely aware of that repositioning going on by one of the other companies. We hadn't really seen that solution very much out there. I mean maybe that's one of the reasons why they've sort of reprioritized, but we see a lot of traction for that product line. I mean, the way you can think about it is \u2013 and maybe I'll just use this, Karl, just to take a second just to answer, kind of a bigger question that some investors have, which is, hey, if you've got all this CapEx shifting to AI, then what happens to the traditional cloud infrastructure side? Does Marvell get impacted by that? Do things like switches, right, as an example, or networking get less spend or do the optics get less spend? And how do you think about that? So, I'd say, one, first of all, we definitely see the AI trend that's obvious that the CapEx is going to move there. But we still see very strong growth for our portfolio in the traditional infrastructure, which includes our switching platforms, which, by the way, some of those will also go back into AI as well. But if you just sort of think about that the spend that's left is going to be \u2013 the dollars are going to be badly needed to make sure that the entire front-end network and the connections between data centers and all of the bandwidth that's required to actually move vast amounts of data inside and out of the data centers, that all needs to still get upgraded. So, I think we still see our traditional cloud infrastructure portfolio growing very strongly second half of this year and next year and the switching portfolio was part of it. We've really doubled down in this area, Karl. We've taken the Innovium product line. We've combined it with our switching broader switching organization. We brought in a new general manager reporting directly to me who is managing all of our higher layer networking technology. We're leveraging that with our optics and long-term, even co-packaged optics road map. So, a lot of investment, a lot of excitement, and we're very happy with how our first product looks in 5-nanometer, which is at 51.2T, we announced it recently, and now it's back. So, all that's going well, Karl. We don't see any real impact from the competitor exiting. We look at more that there's just a growing market, a large opportunity for, I think, people who provide high-performance, higher layer networking technologies to all growth and the market is going to grow a lot.\nKarl Ackerman: Yes. That's very helpful. Perhaps if I could ask another follow-up. Could you discuss the debate on the competitive dynamics of AI. There have been some ASIC design houses in China winning AI designs from hyperscalers, but given the extended revenue trajectory that you spoke about today of your AI programs, it doesn't sound like the competitive landscape has altered your view of the long-term opportunity you see in compute offload in different areas of AI, but if you could just perhaps put a finer point on that, that would be quite helpful? Thank you.\nMatt Murphy: Well, yes, I think, yes, as you heard from our comments, even the wins we got a few years ago, which we had I think at the time, thought we signed appropriately, maybe a little conservatively, but we thought we sized them appropriately. Those have expanded, and those are products we're already developing or have developed. And so that, sort of opportunity that's already there. And I guess the other thing I look at is the design win funnel, and that's expanded dramatically across the board for AI, but a lot of it is in compute offload acceleration, and kind of custom computing. I'd say from a competitive standpoint, and you mentioned potentially overseas competitors. I mean, just given the nature of the criticality of these types of systems. And even at some point, maybe a national security type of concern for this type of AI technology, my belief is that the companies that have strong U.S.-based presence, strong IP portfolio, able to invest in the bleeding-edge technology road map, like 5-nanometer, like 3-nanometer, you name it. Those are the ones that are going to win and be able to do these \u2013 not only design the chips, but manufacture them into high volume and have the scale and capacity to do that. And Marvell is one of just a couple of companies probably that can really, really compete at that level. There may be one-offs here and there. But I just think long-term, the largest companies out there are going to look to the scaled up largest suppliers to support them. Thanks Karl for the question. Appreciate it.\nKarl Ackerman : Helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question comes from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nHarlan Sur: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe just a quick follow-up to the last question on switching. So, I think you might have mentioned this Matt, but I just wanted to verify. Did the team get first silicon [indiscernible] silicon back on your next-generation 51.2T Teralynx 10 switching chipset, any feedback on the performance or do you ship samples to customers? And then your design win funnel is clearly expanding at a significant pace, as you mentioned, right? I think it was last October, the team announced their 3-nanometer IP libraries, right, high-speed idle building blocks, ARM-based cores, so library. So, on this expanding design win funnel, has the team already engaged and is already starting new design wins on 3-nanometer?\nMatt Murphy: Yes, great couple of questions. I think the first one is pretty simple, the product, which we call TL10 or Teralynx 10, we have product in hand. It's looking good. We have a lot of demand to try to ramp this product up, quite frankly, as fast as we can. That's all going well. And on 3-nanometer, a lot of activity there, pretty similar to, I\u2019d say Harlan, to 5-nanometer, where we really readied ourselves at the right time to be able to bid competitively with the best of the best out there. And I'd say, we're extremely well positioned today on 3-nanometer. I'd say just in general, there's a ton of activity, and I think we're sort of in all those conversations. I would say though that \u2013 when we said this previously, the 5-nanometer is going to continue to be a very long, steady workhorse technology that serves a lot of needs for a long time. And I think just in general, as you sort of get to this leading edge we're at, I think it's going to be \u2013 customers are going to be more and more choosy about really weighing cost, power, performance, timing, schedule, the whole 9-yards versus it used to be just kind of automatic. You went from 28, then when you went to 16, and then you went to 12, and then you went to \u2013 just people you just, sort of was like, you just jump. And I think it's each of these is going to have their place in terms of the application set that they serve. So, we're well-positioned really well on both. But certainly for 3-nanometer, we're in the middle of some pretty exciting discussions across almost all of our major end markets.\nHarlan Sur: Perfect. Thank you for the update Matt.\nMatt Murphy: Thanks, Harlan. I think we \u2013 maybe a couple more questions, and then we'll wrap it.\nOperator: The next question comes from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nMatt Ramsay: Hey guys. Thank you very much for taking my questions. [Indiscernible] getting here. So, I appreciate it. So, I have two different questions for you guys. They're unrelated. The first one is, in the guidance here in the short-term, certainly, it seems like consumer SSD is driving some pretty strong growth. And maybe you could give us a little bit more color on your confidence of seen ability of that market, just given \u2013 I mean there certainly are some concerns in pace of China recovery, just return of enterprise, sort of spend in notebook markets and things like that. I'm just trying to understand like the sustainability of that or is this, sort of a snapback off the bottom? Any color there would be helpful. And I guess my second question, really, really encouraging to hear about all these, sort of momentum in the design win pipeline. And obviously, there was a near-term correction in storage and few pushouts. But if you back-up to the 10,000-foot view, it seems like the business momentum has still been really, really strong, and I'm trying to juxtapose that against some OpEx cuts and belt tightening and other things that you guys have done, which seems like this would be the time to be investing more rather than less. So, I'm just trying to square that circle. Hopefully, that makes sense. Thanks.\nMatt Murphy: Totally. Yes, let me answer both and if Willem wants to jump in on the second one at the end, he can. On the first one, yes, I wouldn't really read too much into this one, Matt. The way to think about how that consumer storage business has evolved is, it's a limited number of products. They're really customized designs, I would say. And I wouldn't \u2013 I think somebody earlier you may have been going through [security as this] [ph] we basically said, hey, just sort of assume the first half, Q1 plus Q2, kind of average that out, that's probably where that \u2013 there's a little bit of lumpiness. We were down in Q1. It's kind of going back up in Q2. But if you look at that, half over half, it should be down in the second half and over time, consumer for us will just trend down, kind of in-line with our Investor Day model. So, I wouldn't \u2013 I would not sort of assume that, that just keeps going. I would take a very kind of conservative view on our consumer business. And if it does better, that would be great. We just sort of bank it, put it away and cash the check. But it's not something we put a lot of R&D to in anymore. These are designs from some time ago, and there's a little bit of just a funky Q1, Q2 dynamic on the demand. So, I wouldn't read too much into that. I'm glad you asked on the OpEx. Let me just give you my take and Willem can chime in. So, when \u2013 look, we do our annual strategic plan in Marvell usually every August, kind of September. And so, we did that last year. And between now and then, the world has really changed. It's changed in terms of the market dynamics, what's happening with some of our major customers. The macro economy is different. Interest rates are different. You name it, right? It's sort of summer of last year versus now. And so, we're always very thoughtful about how we think about our R&D and capital allocation. I mean, in my mind, it's the most important thing, Matt, that we do, okay? That lever is really going to be our future or not. And things have changed. And so, we did a very extensive review last quarter, very methodically of all the programs in flight by business unit, by product line, looked at how they compare to what our original estimates were for our estimates, at least the last time we posted it. And we made a number of decisions on some programs where the sponsorship really wasn't there or the customer they were wavering or their plans changed. And at the same time, you've got this inflection where huge surge in demand for AI type of things, optics, you name it. And so, we've done some pretty aggressive repositioning in terms of our spending footprint. And so, we're able to exit the year in a lower OpEx footprint than we're running today, but it's still at an incredibly healthy level. I mean, we're spending more as a percent of R&D than almost all of our peers of, sort of similar or even larger size. We've allocated more R&D to some of the key areas where we see just a lot of activity and growth. In some cases, we've rightsized certain product groups that maybe their new reality is different. Maybe it's a legacy business. It's running at a lower level than it was before. We're just sort of dealing with that on an individual group by individual group basis. And then in some cases, we're just getting more efficiency. I mean as an example, we took our processor business unit and our custom ASIC group. And over time, those two teams end up, kind of at the same customer, they end up sharing IP. We're in all the joint meetings together. And so, Raghib Hussain made the decision, which I think is spot-on, which was to combine those into a single organization. And when you do that, you typically get some efficiency savings. So, I feel very confident in the OpEx profile of the company exiting the year. I think it's appropriate for the conditions we're in. The growth areas are getting more and we're just being very judicious about how we do it. And quite frankly, we had a lot of [growth there] [ph]. We acquired a couple of companies over the last few years. Marvell effectively doubled, right, kind of from pre-pandemic to now in terms of revenues. And so, there was just an opportunity really to go through, kind of systematically and look at what do we need to run this company and run it with compelling financials with a setup for next year with that, sort of OpEx profile and spending level to really enable a tremendous drop through to the bottom line as we get leverage in some of these new design wins kicking in. And so, look, we're going to keep evaluating all the opportunities on a systematic basis. And as our revenues improve and as we see the growth ahead, we'll layer back in, in a thoughtful way. But right now, take kind of the Q4 exit rate that Willem talked about. There'll be some normal step-up in Q1, which would really be just normal payroll tax and merit. And then that's probably, kind of where we hang out for the first half of next year, at least at this time.  Again, if things change and revenues going gangbusters and something we'll look at it, but we're sort of set-up right now to have a very strong flow through, drop through next year and have not sacrificed any growth opportunities. Long answer, but I did want to cover it for the whole investor team out there.\nAshish Saran: Can you get the last question please.\nMatt Murphy: That's the last question, yeah.\nAshish Saran: I think there's one more, Matt.\nOperator: The last question today will come from Srini Pajjuri with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSrini Pajjuri: Yes, thank you. Thanks for squeezing me in. Matt, your enterprise networking business and carrier, obviously, they've grown very strongly in the last couple of years. and you're guiding for, kind of somewhat softer second half, which makes sense. I'm just curious, as we go into the next year, it looks like 5G is at a point where most of the world now has 5G. And in enterprise, the macro is not exactly encouraging right now. So, just curious to hear your thoughts on how you're thinking about the growth in those segments as we go into the first half of next year?\nMatt Murphy: Sure. Yes, great questions. And I think we've got a very, kind of practical view on these, Srini. So, on enterprise, I think you indicated in your part of your question, I mean, this actually business is really outperformed relative to the expectations we set at our Investor Day in 2021. Lot of great progress on share gains, content gains as things like multi-gig ramped up, we added things like new custom ASICs. So, that business has sort of outperformed, but it's outperformed because the market was good, but also really because of our own doing. And so, we've been saying for some time, it's going to correct.  It did better than we thought in Q1, but it will come down in Q2. And yes, I think that environment you've sort of got is correct. But I think of enterprise, at least now it's kind of at least if you look at it year-on-year from last year, this year or next year, it's kind of flattish. We've got \u2013 even if there's some \u2013 there'll be quarters where it's down more. But if you, sort of normalize it, there'll be \u2013 we still have, sort of a strong story underneath, if you will. But we're not saying it's a grower for sure, and there'll be a couple of quarters or however long it takes to do some inventory clearing. I think you're right on overall carrier, especially on 5G. There's been very robust deployments worldwide. You still got things like India, which are happening this year, and there'll be more other regions next year. But I do think that overall, the market side will probably move down. At the same time, we still have content gains in front of us. So, that's a little bit of an offset. There's still at least one kind of bigger socket that still hasn't ramped. So, I think our content story is still pretty good in 5G. But look, we've got pretty good visibility through the third quarter of this year, after that, we do think it's going to drop in Q4, and then where it ends up next year is, kind of a little bit early, but I'd say, at some point, we have content that layers in there, too. So, hopefully, that's helpful to kind of paint a picture, but we're not pounding the table that these are going to be continued growth drivers into 2025. We're actually modeling. And then something like wired, we're modeling it to still stay pretty weak in telecom for some time. So, there's some puts and takes, obviously, in the overall business.\nSrini Pajjuri: Got it. Thanks Matt.\nMatt Murphy: With that I think we could wrap it. A lot of questions, I know. But we want to make sure we answered them all. We appreciate everybody's participation today. I look forward to the call backs and talking to everybody afterwards. So, thanks very much, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session.

            "name": "Willem Meintjes",
            "content": "Thanks Matt, and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with a summary of our financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue in the first quarter was 1.322 billion, exceeding the midpoint of our guidance declining 9% year-over-year and 7% sequentially. Data center was our largest end market driving 33% of total revenue. Enterprise networking was the next largest with 27% of total revenue followed by carrier infrastructure at 22%, consumer at 11%, and auto industrial at 7%. GAAP gross margin was 42.2%. Non-GAAP gross margin was 60% in-line with guidance. Our gross margin results reflected the adverse revenue mix we had forecasted for this first quarter. GAAP operating expenses were 740 million, including share based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, restructuring costs related to headcount reductions, and acquisition related costs. Non-GAAP operating expenses were 459 million, slightly below guidance. First quarter operating expenses reflected the step-up from the prior quarter, due to typical seasonality and payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases. GAAP operating margin was negative 13.8%. Non-GAAP operating margin was 25.3%. For the first quarter, GAAP loss per diluted share was $0.20. Non-GAAP income per diluted share was $0.31, $0.02 above the midpoint of guidance. Now, turning to our cash flow and balance sheet. During the quarter, cash flow from operations was 208 million. This included 40 million in payments for previously committed long-term capacity payments. Looking ahead, we are currently anticipating minimal additional payments for capacity for the rest of fiscal 2024 and beyond. As a result, we expect a much reduced headwind to operating cash flow as compared to fiscal 2023, where payments for long-term capacity totaled approximately 250 million. Inventory at the end of the first quarter was 1.03 billion, decreasing by 42 million sequentially. Our days sales outstanding was 69 days, a decrease of 7 days from the prior quarter. We returned 51 million to shareholders through cash dividends. As of the end of the fiscal first quarter, our cash and cash equivalents were 1.03 billion, almost all of which is held in systemically important banks. Our total debt was 4.68 billion, which included a drawdown of 200 million from our revolving line of credit. Our gross debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.1x and net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 1.6x. Before I provide specific guidance for the second quarter, let me describe our plan for gross margin, operating expenses, and capital allocation for the rest of the year. As you are aware, significant inventory corrections in certain businesses caused an adverse revenue mix, which impacted our gross margin. We are optimistic that inventory corrections will be largely done by the fourth quarter and that we will be shipping closer to end demand at that time. We have also put in place multiple cost reduction efforts to improve gross margin. Internally, we are optimizing headcount and further streamlining operations. Externally, we continue to partner with our strategic suppliers to drive more efficiency in the supply chain. We are confident that as a result of mix improvement and our cost reduction efforts, our non-GAAP gross margin will start to improve. We expect modest improvement in the third quarter and by the fourth quarter, we can return to at least the low-end of our target range of 64% to 66%. As Matt told you, we are making strategic road map adjustments and driving additional efficiencies all whilst maintaining our long-term growth outlook. As a result, we expect to reduce our non-GAAP operating expense in the fourth quarter to be approximately 430 million. The fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 is a 14-week quarter. So, included in this forecast is approximately 10 million in expenses for the extra week. Therefore, on a normalized 13-week basis, we expect the run rate for our non-GAAP OpEx exiting this year to be 420 million. As we look ahead to fiscal 2025, we expect that typical seasonality and payroll taxes and employee salary merit increases in the first quarter will cause OpEx to step-up sequentially. As a result, we are modeling first quarter fiscal 2025 OpEx to increase sequentially by mid-to-high single-digits on a percentage basis from the normalized 13-week exit rate of 420 million in the prior quarter. We are confident that this sets us up to drive tremendous operating leverage next year. In terms of capital allocation, we have 500 million of our total debt due in January 2023 that we are planning on paying off using our cash balance and free cash flow. This will improve our gross leverage meaningfully going forward. Following this payoff, we expect to resume our buyback program in the third quarter. Turning to our guidance for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. We are forecasting revenue to be in the range of 1.33 billion, plus or minus 5%. We expect our GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 44.3% to 46.8%. We project our non-GAAP gross margin will be in the range of 60% to 61%. We project our GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 694 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP operating expenses to be approximately 455 million. We expect other income and expense, including interest on our debt to be approximately 51 million. For the second quarter, we expect a non-GAAP tax rate of 7%. We expect our basic weighted average shares outstanding will be 861 million, and our diluted weighted average shares outstanding will be 865 million. As a result, we anticipate GAAP earnings per share in the range of a loss of $0.16 per share on the low-end to an income of $0.05 per diluted share on the high-end. We expect non-GAAP income per diluted share in the range of $0.27 to $0.37. In summary, as we move forward through this fiscal year, we project our revenue to continue to grow sequentially, gross margin to improve significantly in the fourth quarter, and operating expenses to continue to step down. Our DSO and inventory have already shown signs of improvement. As a result, we are looking forward to driving tremendous operating leverage and significant improvement in cash flow generation over this year, while setting up a strong platform for growth next year. Operator, please open the line and announce Q&A instructions. Thank you. Yes. Ambrish, thanks for the question. So, yes, we're very confident on getting back to the bottom end of our range in Q4. Some of the main drivers, I think, as Matt pointed out, that wireless carrier, we expect that to continue to be really strong through the third quarter and then really to take a step down in Q4. We've seen the storage recovery starting, and we expect that to continue through the fourth quarter. And then, I'd also point to the optical products and by AI. We're seeing that strength pick up through the year. And all of those are very much accretive to our gross margin. But then in addition to that, all the OpEx reduction initiatives that we're driving internally, as well as the work that we're doing with our supply chain. We expect all that to really more meaningfully impact our P&L in Q4. So, that gives us confidence. Hopefully, that would clarify. Thank you."

            "name": "Matt Murphy",
            "content": "Thanks Ashish, and good afternoon everyone. For the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Marvell's revenue was 1.322 billion, above the midpoint of guidance. Higher revenue drove our non-GAAP earnings per share to $0.31, $0.02 above the mid-point. We were guiding revenue for the second quarter to go to 133 billion at the mid-point and expect sequential revenue growth will accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year. Before we get to our results for each end market, let me start by discussing the tremendous opportunity that AI represents for Marvell. In the past, we considered AI to be one of many applications within cloud, but its importance and therefore the opportunity has increased dramatically. Generative AI is rapidly driving new applications and changing the investment priorities for our cloud customers. Today's AI workloads require truly massive datasets. To efficiently process this data, the architecture for AI data centers is significantly different than standard cloud infrastructure. Rather than dual socket servers at the core element in Iraq, the primary building block in AI is a system containing multiple accelerators such as GPUs. In large deployments, thousands of these systems are interconnected to form a data center sized AI cluster, and what's required to interconnect these systems is orders of magnitude higher than in standard cloud infrastructure. To give you an idea, the latest dual CPU server in the cloud data center today can drive up to 200 gigabits per second of IO and contains the network interfaces to support that bandwidth. In contrast, an example of an advanced AI system containing 8 accelerators can drive close to 30 terabits of full duplex bandwidth. As hundreds of times more bandwidth required to connect these systems together, keep in mind, [meeting cloud data] [ph] centers connect thousands of these systems in a single cluster to provide maximum scalability for their customers with each of these systems capable of driving tens of terabits of network traffic. And in order to create the largest possible cluster sizes at data center scale, these connections need to be able to operate over increasingly long distances. These clusters require a staggering amount of high bandwidth connectivity, all of which needs to be provided at ultra-low latency and high reliability. And within a reasonable power outlook. This connectivity is best provided by fully optically connected infrastructure, utilizing digital signal processing and low latency high capacity fabric switches. This is why we see AI as a strong growth driver for our PAM4 optical DSP platform. And it is important to note that these DSPs are compatible with a variety of network protocols such as Ethernet, InfiniBand, and other proprietary solutions for maximum breadth and flexibility. Going forward, we see this trend only accelerating. While today's most advanced AI systems are already using the highest bandwidth interfaces available, it might surprise you to learn that the performance scale of current AI implementations are still constrained by network capacity. Take the [8 accelerator] [ph] AI system I discussed earlier, for example. Those systems today typically contain four 800 gigabit per second optical interfaces for external connectivity, which provide an aggregate of 3.2 terabits per second of bandwidth. But that is in a system capable of driving close to 10x that bandwidth. To bridge this gap, we expect that the number of optical interfaces per AI system to continue to grow as these clusters scale. And the next generation of accelerators are expected to have even more compute capability and higher bandwidth requirements. Given the speed at which AI infrastructure is advancing, the technology refresh rate is happening at 18 months to 24 months versus 4 plus years in standard infrastructure. Altogether, we expect a massive amount of connectivity in these AI clusters, increasing adoption of higher speed optical interfaces, and faster refresh rates to be a major demand drivers for our PAM4 DSP platform. In fact, in our last earnings call, we indicated that the ramp in our industry leading 800 gig DSP platform was driven almost entirely by AI applications. We have also announced the industry's first 1.6 terabit PAM4 DSP platform, doubling the throughput from the current generation, and we expect AI to drive the initial adoption of these products as well. In addition, as inference is deployed at multiple regional data centers, they need to be connected by high bandwidth low latency optical links over tens of kilometers. This technology has noticed data center interconnect or DCI, and Marvell has been a pioneer in this market. We created the industry's first pluggable module for DCI, and we are now providing 400 gigabits per second in our latest DCI product line. We already seen that AI cloud data centers are driving a significant increase in demand for 400 ZR solution. Another demand driver for our DCI products is that the next generation AI implementations are planning on clustering accelerators across different sites. AI is also a key growth driver of demand for switching inside the data center. Marvell has a growing position in the market for low latency high capacity switches, and we are seeing strong demand for our products. We recently announced our next generation 51.2T Teralynx 10 ethernet switching platform. Platform is based on the low latency architecture we acquired from Innovium and is built on Marvell's leading 5 nanometer technology platform. We are seeing strong interest for this product. We expect AI to lead the industry's transition from today's 12.8T switches to 51.2T enabling a quadrupling and network bandwidth. We expect 51.2T adoption will be a strong growth driver for the networking semiconductor market. Putting it all together, Marvell has built both a leading position and network connectivity for AI. We expect tremendous growth for our PAM4 optics DCI and Ethernet switching solutions fueled by the growing investment in AI. Perhaps even more exciting is Marvell's opportunity to address compute in AI through our cloud optimized silicon platform. As you heard earlier, the architecture of an AI data center is fundamentally different. In standard cloud infrastructure, the bulk of the compute is performed by CPUs, while accelerators are primarily used for off-load tasks, such as networking and security. In contrast in AI infrastructure, accelerators like GPUs are the primary compute engines, while CPUs are used for control purposes, a 180 degree reversal from standard cloud infrastructure. Fundamental difference results in a higher ratio of accelerators to CPUs and AI with accelerators now to dominate compute opportunity. This combined with the sharp increase in AI investment is driving a higher proportion of the incremental compute [PAM] [ph] in cloud data centers towards accelerators. Today, we see cloud customers enhancing their AI offerings by building custom accelerators of their own designed to address their specific needs. This is a core part of Marvell's cloud optimized silicon strategy, and we now see a much larger and faster growing opportunity for custom compute and AI infrastructure. When we previously discussed our cloud optimized silicon opportunities and revenue ramp expectations at our Investor Day in October 2021, we projected revenue from the first set of design wins to grow to $800 million annually once all the programs were in production. These designs included a variety of accelerated computing applications including AI, security, storage, and video along with several networking applications. When we look today at the same set of design wins, driven by AI, our total lifetime revenue expectations from these have increased significantly. Same time, the relative proportion of projected lifetime revenue from AI has increased from approximately 20% in our prior forecast to well over half today. As a result, computing and AI applications has now grown to become the single largest revenue driver and opportunity for Marvell's cloud optimized silicon platform. The continuing increase in demand from AI, we see annual revenue from those same set of cloud optimized design wins, well exceeding the prior 800 million projection as these programs ramp over time. In fact, we have a number of custom silicon products tied to AI expected to ramp into volume production next year. As an example for one of these programs, initial samples are already up and running at our customer's lab and qualification is proceeding well. And in other case, we expect to take out this quarter and deliver first silicon before the end of the calendar year. As you can see, in addition to our strong position in network connectivity for AI, we believe we are well-positioned to address the compute opportunity. Over the last few months, we have taken time and carefully map our revenue from AI so we can track its progress over time. Given the tremendous progress we've made, including the recent demand increases from our customers, we are expecting our revenue driven by AI applications to grow at an accelerated pace. In fiscal 2023, we estimate that our AI revenue was approximately 200 million, up dramatically from the prior year. This revenue was primarily from our PAM4 optics and 400ZR DCI products. Since our last earnings call in early March, bookings for these products have increased very significantly. As a result, we expect Marvell's overall AI revenue to at least double in fiscal 2024. Looking to fiscal 2025, we expect robust growth to continue from AI for network connectivity. Layering on top of this is the growth we expect from the ramp of the cloud optimized programs we discussed earlier in the call. In aggregate, we foresee our overall AI revenue to at least double again next year. In other words, we are forecasting an AI revenue growth CAGR over 100% over the fiscal 2023 to 2025 time frame. In the future, we expect generative AI implementations involving video and images to provide a tailwind to overall storage and exabyte growth, both in HDD and Flash. However, it is difficult to accurately allocate revenue from our storage business specifically to AI. So, the AI revenue forecast I just discussed does not include any storage contributions. In addition, we expect the increase in network traffic from AI will also provide a tailwind for our broader networking portfolio over time, which we have not yet captured in our AI revenue forecast. We've seen rapid shifts in our cloud customers plan to spending on AI infrastructures becoming a much bigger portion of their CapEx. We believe that Marvell is one of a scarce few semiconductor companies positioned to enable this trend and is uniquely able to participate in all three aspects of AI systems, networking, compute, and storage. We set out in 2016 to pivot Marvell to data infrastructure and have successfully executed that strategy, forming the right team, technology, and customer relationships to lead in this market. With AI becoming the ultimate data infrastructure application, Marvell is at the center of this incredible transformation. We are confident that we will be one of the most relied on semiconductor companies to help our customers achieve their vision. We look forward to sharing our continued progress in AI in the future. Let me move on now to reviewing our results and expectations by end market starting with data center. In our data center end market, revenue for the first quarter was 436 million, declining 32% year-over-year and 12% sequentially. Our overall data center revenue in the first quarter was higher than guidance driven by cloud where we saw stronger demand for our optical data center interconnect products from expanding AI deployments. As expected, storage was responsible for the majority of the overall sequential decline in our data center revenue in the first quarter, although we are forecasting sequential growth to start in the second quarter and our data center storage business continue to grow in the second half. Looking ahead to the second quarter for our overall data center end market, we expect cloud revenue to grow over 10% sequentially. However, we are expecting the enterprise on-premise portion of our data center end market to decline an offset growth from cloud. As a result, we expect revenue from our overall data center end market to be flat sequentially in the second quarter. Turning to our carrier infrastructure end market, revenue for the first quarter was 290 million growing 15% year-over-year and 5% sequentially. We saw strong demand for our wireless products, as 5G adoption continued to expand in new geographic regions along with our customer specific product ramps. This resulted in approximate 25% sequential growth in wireless revenue. Partially offsetting our wireless growth was the start of inventory digestion in our wired end market. Moving on to our outlook for the next quarter, we expect revenue from our overall carrier end market to decline in the mid-single-digits sequentially, due to continued inventory digestion in our wired end market. Moving on to our enterprise networking end market. Revenue for the first quarter was 365 million, growing 27% year-over-year and flat sequentially, which is better than our guidance. Our first quarter enterprise networking results reflected a strong ramp in custom ASICs offset by our planned reduction in channel and customer inventory of our merchant products. Looking ahead to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we project our enterprise networking revenue to decline by more than 10% sequentially, due to inventory corrections in this end market. Turning to our automotive and industrial end market, revenue in the first quarter was 89 million, flat year-over-year and declining 10% sequentially. While our automotive business continues to deliver strong growth both year-over-year and sequentially, these gains were offset by a decline in our industrial business. Looking to the second quarter of fiscal 2024, we project revenue from our auto and industrial end market to grow sequentially in the low teens on a percentage basis. Moving on to our consumer end market, revenue for the first quarter was 142 million below our guidance declining 20% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. Looking ahead to the second quarter, we are forecasting revenue to grow sequentially in the mid-30% range, driven by strong seasonal growth in demand for our custom SSD controllers. In addition, we are expecting growth from our ACD controllers as we start shipping closer to end market consumption. In summary, we are guiding sequential growth to resume starting with the second quarter and we expect growth will accelerate in the second half of the fiscal year. Few markets remain choppy and we expect revenue from our wired and enterprise end markets to continue to trend down due to macroeconomic uncertainty and inventory corrections. We expect revenue from our wireless end market to step-up in the third quarter before taking a pause and declining in the fourth quarter. We see many positive signs in our data center end markets. We are forecasting our data center storage revenue to resume growth in the second quarter and continue to improve as we start shipping closer to end market demand. Putting aside storage, we expect cloud to be the key growth driver for our data center revenue. We are guiding our cloud revenue to grow over 10% sequentially in the second quarter, and we are seeing a significant increase in demand from AI for the rest of the year. In addition, we expect our cloud optimized silicon programs to ramp more meaningfully as the year progresses, in-line with the revised expectations we outlined during last quarter's call. As a result, we are confident in our expectations for higher growth for the company in the second half of the year. We also expect to drive significant margin improvement going forward. We anticipate that inventory corrections will be mostly behind us by the end of this year, and we are excited about the resumption of revenue growth driven by Marvell's specific product ramps. We have been laser focused on a number of cost improvement actions to improve gross margin. As a result, we have confidence in our forecast for our non-GAAP gross margin to return to at least the low-end of our target range in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. We've been in extensive discussions with our customers and have a clear view of their current road maps. While some programs have been pushed out, others have been accelerated. We are aggressively reprioritizing our investments, aligning to the highest ROI opportunities in front of us. We are also focused on driving additional efficiency to further reduce our operating expenses. We are making strategic road map adjustments and combining some of our businesses to reflect changes in the market. As an example, resulting from our customers' growing needs for custom compute, we've combined our custom ASIC and processor product groups into a single organization. Other teams are also working on efficiency improvements. As a result, we expect our OpEx to exit at a lower run rate than previously communicated. This discipline on expenses is expected to carry into fiscal 2025 and help us to deliver strong operating leverage going forward. Willem will provide more details in his commentary. Before closing, I'd like to express my appreciation to Rick Hill, who will be retiring from the Marvell Board at the end of his current term. Rick joined Marvell a little over 7 years ago as Chairman of the Board and acting CEO during a very difficult time. He moved quickly to stabilize the company, personally reassuring customers, employees, and shareholders. He helped establish a world-class board of directors and was instrumental in the recruiting of the first key group of executives. I joined Marvell in large part because of Rick. It is very rare to find an individual who is willing to contribute their time and energy and impart their wisdom to others for the satisfaction of seeing a company thrive and the next generation leaders succeed. At the most critical moments over the past 7 years, Rick always had the Marvell teams back and his belief in the team enabled us to take bold steps to transform the company. Without his leadership and mentorship, Marvell would not be where it is today. I'm truly grateful to Rick for his exceptional contributions to Marvell, and it's an honor for me to succeed him as Board Chair. Additionally, I would like to express my appreciation to Dr. Ed Frank, who joined us from the Cavium Board in 2018. Ed has been an outstanding director and will be retiring for the Marvell Board when his term expires in June. I'm grateful to Ed for his years of dedicated service to Marvell. Finally, I want to thank our dedicated team of employees. Together, we are moving forward with confidence that Marvell's best days are yet to come. With that, I'll turn the call over to Willem for more detail on our recent results and outlook. Yes. Hey, Ross. Thanks for the question. Yes, I think it's encouraging to see revenue growth in the second quarter. So overall, with the total company revenue bottoming and then encouraging to see cloud pick back up, growing sequentially in Q2, you know, 10%, kind of plus, and that's driven by AI. So that's certainly been a positive. I think, maybe I'll just talk about the rest of the business. There's a number of moving pieces. A lot of it barely pretty much came in line in terms of things like carrier, automotive, etcetera. So, we haven't seen a ton of behavior change there. Really the biggest change, I would say is that, the \u2013 I think two things related to AI. The first is just the level of bookings, backlog, forecast increase, particularly for our optical products has increased significantly. That's a positive. The second is that we really took the time between last quarter and this quarter to, in a very detailed manner, quantify our AI revenue stream, where it was coming from, what's driving it. We now have it actually embedded in our system as a separate end market that we can filter by. So, we have a good view of the history, a good view of the future. And we definitely wanted to take the time so that when we communicated numbers, they were rock solid. And what you're seeing is a really positive story, which is basically, you know, around a $200 million level of revenue for AI last year. And then, you know, at least what we see is doubling this year and then at least doubling again next year. So, that's probably been the single biggest change. I'd say, just the uptick in AI, which was a little bit behind some of the announcements maybe going on last quarter, but it's definitely here for us. And I'd say the broader cloud infrastructure side, non-AI is also picking up and will also grow in the second quarter and grow throughout the year and actually has a great set-up for next year as well. So, those are some of the things that have gone on. And just one final note on the AI stuff, we \u2013 I said in my prepared remarks, but just for everybody on the call, we deliberately don't include storage at this time in AI. We found it pretty difficult to map that particular set of products, you know, directly to AI systems or not. Clearly, there's going to be a tailwind for that business over time just given the amount of data that's going to need to get stored. But so really what you're seeing is, I think a very clean and very exciting AI number. Yeah. Hey, Tim. So, I'd just give you some data, sort of what way to think about it. I think first is, we just start with the second quarter. Okay. So, we're seeing sequential growth. And again, when you look at the data center piece. The cloud growth is being offset by continued weakness in on-prem enterprise. And as you've noted, that's clearly been an issue for, kind of the overall server market the last probably five quarters, if you kind of take the read-through to enterprise networking, same thing. There's a lot of inventory on the customer balance sheet. So, we have signaled for some time. We expect that that continues to correct throughout the year. I think what I'd really point you to is, the company has inflected back-up in terms of growth in Q2. And as we look out, you know, even beyond the second half. I mean, if you just kind of look into the next year, we have the AI doubling again, you know, at least in our fiscal 2025. We see strong continued growth in our cloud infrastructure. So, non-AI the cloud, also driving meaningful growth. That's both growth and optics, as well as storage coming back, as well as some cloud optimized programs. So, that's a positive. Automotive continues to grow next year. And then as you as you indicated, you know, storage is still very low. It's come off the bottom in our guide for Q2, but should be back, you know, next year. So, lot of very strong growth drivers. So, you need to kind of draw a line between the first half now and next year. And I think the way you're thinking about it is the right, which is some of the markets are going to be choppier like enterprise. And we also said that in carrier, we've had this incredible run in our 5G wireless business over the last several years. We actually see that continue in Q2 and Q3, but probably in the fourth quarter is where that will drop off after a long run. It just \u2013 we've got our own product cycles going, but that gets more than offset, obviously, by all the growth in data center. So, great set-up for the second half. Really Cloud AI driven and would more than offset any, kind of comprehensive weakness or choppiness in some of the other end markets. Hopefully, that's helpful. We don't, yeah. We're not yet. And the bottom line is, we're not \u2013 like most companies, we're not going to guide the second half specifically at this point, but clearly going to accelerate off of where we are today. Yes. Yeah. Great question, Vivek. So, when you think about this year, it's \u2013 we said it's, you know, at least doubling. So, think of it as 400 plus and it wants to be more, by the way, and we're working on that. That is almost, you know, almost completely driven by our PAM4 optics, PAM4 DSP, as well as some of the DCI stuff that's driving a lot of AI traffic and regional data center. So, think of it as mostly driven by optics. Some networking as you point out and probably a little bit of cloud optimized, but think of it as mostly just really strong 800 gig ramp that we're seeing in PAM4. That continues into next year, but then we layer in the cloud optimized ramps as well. And so both of those contribute to the incremental growth and the, sort of over doubling into the next year. And as we get through the year Vivek, we'll be able to quantify this a little bit more. I mean, you can imagine how fast things are moving in this area. It's incredibly dynamic, it's incredibly exciting, and positive. And I'd say almost on a daily or every other day basis, there's, sort of new positive incremental updates. So, as we go forward, we'll share more, but think of it really this year as the PAM4 train running very strong into next year, and then we start layering and the cloud optimized on top of it. And as we said in the prepared remarks, I think what's really exciting is those wins we articulated several years ago, right at our 2021 Analyst Day. So, these are products we've been working on for some time now. And, you know, normally, products take about 18 months to 24 months to develop and then a period of time to ramp. So, next year, the timing looks really good. Sure. So, what we said, what I said, and there was a lot in the detail, but we reconfirmed we're tracking to the number we gave you guys last time, which was the 200 million. I'd say, it is potentially higher, but I think that's a safe number. And then at a high level, I think, just given how dynamic the situation is, we're not guiding a specific number for next year. But what we did say is, the original, sort of estimate back in, when we gave it at the at the Analyst Day in 2021 it was that you have, you know, 800 million and kind of the fiscal 2025 to 2026 time frame. And then what I updated on the call was that that peak revenue was actually going to exceed the 800 million, just given that the total lifetime volume now of those same design wins has actually increased pretty significantly. And then the percentage of those has moved meaningfully towards AI. So, it's all tracking in the right direction for this year and then for next year we'll see how it goes. You know, I really don't want to cap it quite frankly, and it's too early to even call a number. Yes. I think I would \u2013 well, let me clarify one thing. I'd say, we're not completely out of the woods yet on cloud. So, I'd say the \u2013 think of it as the 10% sequential growth, which is really positive, by the way. We're happy to see that inflect back up. The way to kind of think about it is the AI portion of it is moving up quite dramatically, as you can imagine. But the traditional infrastructure side is also going up, but it's still got a little bit to clear. So, actually, I'd say there's a little bit more tailwind there in terms of inventory digestion on the cloud side, which would be, kind of additional stuff. So that would kick in. And then storage is still \u2013 we're still way under shipping demand. So that will be a positive exiting the year. And then, yes, you're right, like we took some actions in enterprise on our own, some in Q1 that didn't quite get it all done. So, we're getting it all \u2013 the rest of it done in Q2. These are more us driving it in terms of working inventory down, so that when we exit the year, it's more rebalanced. So, there's a few pockets where there's still some inventory overhang, obviously, something like an AI is not, and then wireless 5G, I mean that just stepped up 25% sequentially. So, we've been shipping pretty hard on that one. But yes, there's a few pieces. But when you kind of add it all up, we see across the board, we should be in pretty good shape in terms of shipping back to what normalized demand would be. And that was really Willem's point, it's just some of these product lines that just when they come back to normal shipping to demand run rate, it's definitely a tailwind for gross margin. And then, of course, on top of that, we have our own programs we're driving to ensure our success to get the gross margins back up. Yes. Well, I think, Blayne, there's kind of a couple of pieces to that. So, the first is, we had an initial set of design wins that we sized and articulated at the October 2021 Investor Day. And that was this $400 million going to $800 million. And as you pointed out, roughly 20% of that lifetime revenue at the time was for AI, 80% was sort of for traditional cloud infrastructure. And then now we've seen, sort of the AI piece really take-off in terms of expectations for it. So, that \u2013 just to clarify, that is just going apples-to-apples with what we communicated two years ago. I mean \u2013 and those are the projects now that are coming to fruition. But I mean, just to be very clear, since that time, we have layered in a significant number of incremental new design wins. And those are \u2013 many of those are now underway, probably not as much revenue from those next year, but then those would be, sort of the year after. And I would just also add that our design win funnel, and this is data I was just reviewing at the company level, who's just expanded dramatically with the biggest portion of that coming from our cloud design win funnel. And then of the cloud, you can imagine the AI portion has become very significant versus where it was 2 or 3 years ago. So, I'd say on a number of aspects, wins we claimed 2 years ago go into production. Incremental activity and wins since then, so that would indicate long-term even a higher number in terms of our AI potential. And then the funnel looks extremely robust. And so that all leads to a, I think, a very bright outlook in terms of where this can go over the next 5 to 7 years depending on how long it takes to, sort of flow all these through. So, we're in the very early innings here, Blayne, I think, as you can imagine. Yes, I think, Blayne, the way to think about it is, generally, I'd say, this has been our story for 5G as it's unfolded over the last, call it, 3 years. It's grown virtually almost every quarter. And if you look at where we were coming off of last year, we were pretty excited, right? We hit kind of the $600 million bogey we had talked about. And then we had to step up big time in Q1 of 25% sequential off of Q4, which we said is going to continue actually in Q2 and probably remain strong through Q3. So, at some point, this base station market is pretty lumpy, especially the deployment. There's a lot of concern around CapEx out there. Some people have already, sort of seen it, but given that we're mostly in new products, and we don't have a lot of 4G overhang, we've been able to power through. But yes, I think the India stuff is definitely comprehended in this 25% step-up we already took and then really three very strong quarters this year before we see a drop off in Q4. And then sometime in next year, we'll have some growth again at some point. But it's been running pretty hot. And I think we've been pretty much way outperforming in terms of what other people are seeing in the telecom market. Got it. Yes. Tore, you bring up a very good point. So, when I referred to storage earlier, it was really on the existing product lines we have, which is primarily hard disk drive controllers, preamplifiers, and flash controllers. And that one, we just \u2013 we tried. We spent a lot of time on it over the last 3 months, trying to map it and ultimately, we just said, let's keep it out for now. But you have a very good point in that, something I haven't talked about, which is there's going to be a tremendous demand for CXL in these large systems, especially as the DRAM and the memory really needs to scale pretty dramatically. And we are seeing strong pull from customers on those solutions and kind of the lead product we're doing is under a lot of scheduled pressure to get it out because of the need. So, I think that's another leg to the stool. That's not really in our, kind of comprehended in our next year numbers per se, but it's definitely out there. And I think that's going to drive a whole other segment for us. I'd also say there's things like AECs, which is another product category that we've invested in that's getting extremely strong traction, very happy with the progress there. That's something that can layer in again over time. So, there's a few other shots on goal we have that really leverage the core DSP and analog mixed signal capability we have inside of Marvell. And we're going to continue to try to leverage those and really be as broad-based as a supplier as we can. And again, and if you think about, sort of all the [hops] [ph], all the data hops that are coming in and out of these systems, we want to be the lead company that our customers go to for these solutions, whether it's CXL, ACs, PAM4 DSP, optics, DCI. And then, of course, the more exciting, not more but has exciting opportunity in the custom silicon area. So, a lot of stuff going on. Sure. Let me take it in two pieces. So, on the data center side, it did bottom out in Q1. So, it will be up a little bit in Q2, but more \u2013 it will kind of grow throughout the year, but really I don't think it recovers \u2013 and even if it doesn't recover all the way, it recovers mostly probably by the fourth quarter, C.J., the January quarter, not the third quarter. But it will \u2013 think of Q1 and Q2 as being very, very low. And then it comes back in the second half step-up in Q3 and then in Q4. And we're really not modeling it at this point even in Q4 getting back up to like 100% of where it was.  I think, we're probably at 75% to 80%, just in our own models, just to be conservative. But certainly, over time, that should normalize. So that's the data center one. The good news is, it's come off the bottom and it's growing in Q2 and will get better in the second half. On the consumer side, yes, this is not a super strategic end market for us. There's some moving pieces. Q1, if you looked at, it was a little bit low, Q2 has got this kind of funky 30% growth. That's on the flash side, kind of normalize those two. It's probably in the range of where it should be. Just the way to think about overall consumer is, it's actually outperformed if you went back to, kind of our Investor Day model a few years ago, it's seen a lot of strength. But at some point, it's going to \u2013 and our model was always to trend down over time. I would say that probably starts in the second half and continues through next year. And look, if we get a bluebird, that's great. You never know, we got a lot of bluebirds over the last few years. But just given we don't put a lot of R&D behind it, the way to think about consumer is you got Q1 and Q2, just assume the second half is probably lower and then it just trends down over time, more in-line with what we talked about at the Investor Day model. Hopefully, that's helpful. Oh, I see. Yes, you're talking about the switching portfolio, Karl? Yes. Okay. No, I would say, definitely aware of that repositioning going on by one of the other companies. We hadn't really seen that solution very much out there. I mean maybe that's one of the reasons why they've sort of reprioritized, but we see a lot of traction for that product line. I mean, the way you can think about it is \u2013 and maybe I'll just use this, Karl, just to take a second just to answer, kind of a bigger question that some investors have, which is, hey, if you've got all this CapEx shifting to AI, then what happens to the traditional cloud infrastructure side? Does Marvell get impacted by that? Do things like switches, right, as an example, or networking get less spend or do the optics get less spend? And how do you think about that? So, I'd say, one, first of all, we definitely see the AI trend that's obvious that the CapEx is going to move there. But we still see very strong growth for our portfolio in the traditional infrastructure, which includes our switching platforms, which, by the way, some of those will also go back into AI as well. But if you just sort of think about that the spend that's left is going to be \u2013 the dollars are going to be badly needed to make sure that the entire front-end network and the connections between data centers and all of the bandwidth that's required to actually move vast amounts of data inside and out of the data centers, that all needs to still get upgraded. So, I think we still see our traditional cloud infrastructure portfolio growing very strongly second half of this year and next year and the switching portfolio was part of it. We've really doubled down in this area, Karl. We've taken the Innovium product line. We've combined it with our switching broader switching organization. We brought in a new general manager reporting directly to me who is managing all of our higher layer networking technology. We're leveraging that with our optics and long-term, even co-packaged optics road map. So, a lot of investment, a lot of excitement, and we're very happy with how our first product looks in 5-nanometer, which is at 51.2T, we announced it recently, and now it's back. So, all that's going well, Karl. We don't see any real impact from the competitor exiting. We look at more that there's just a growing market, a large opportunity for, I think, people who provide high-performance, higher layer networking technologies to all growth and the market is going to grow a lot. Well, yes, I think, yes, as you heard from our comments, even the wins we got a few years ago, which we had I think at the time, thought we signed appropriately, maybe a little conservatively, but we thought we sized them appropriately. Those have expanded, and those are products we're already developing or have developed. And so that, sort of opportunity that's already there. And I guess the other thing I look at is the design win funnel, and that's expanded dramatically across the board for AI, but a lot of it is in compute offload acceleration, and kind of custom computing. I'd say from a competitive standpoint, and you mentioned potentially overseas competitors. I mean, just given the nature of the criticality of these types of systems. And even at some point, maybe a national security type of concern for this type of AI technology, my belief is that the companies that have strong U.S.-based presence, strong IP portfolio, able to invest in the bleeding-edge technology road map, like 5-nanometer, like 3-nanometer, you name it. Those are the ones that are going to win and be able to do these \u2013 not only design the chips, but manufacture them into high volume and have the scale and capacity to do that. And Marvell is one of just a couple of companies probably that can really, really compete at that level. There may be one-offs here and there. But I just think long-term, the largest companies out there are going to look to the scaled up largest suppliers to support them. Thanks Karl for the question. Appreciate it. Yes, great couple of questions. I think the first one is pretty simple, the product, which we call TL10 or Teralynx 10, we have product in hand. It's looking good. We have a lot of demand to try to ramp this product up, quite frankly, as fast as we can. That's all going well. And on 3-nanometer, a lot of activity there, pretty similar to, I'd say Harlan, to 5-nanometer, where we really readied ourselves at the right time to be able to bid competitively with the best of the best out there. And I'd say, we're extremely well positioned today on 3-nanometer. I'd say just in general, there's a ton of activity, and I think we're sort of in all those conversations. I would say though that \u2013 when we said this previously, the 5-nanometer is going to continue to be a very long, steady workhorse technology that serves a lot of needs for a long time. And I think just in general, as you sort of get to this leading edge we're at, I think it's going to be \u2013 customers are going to be more and more choosy about really weighing cost, power, performance, timing, schedule, the whole 9-yards versus it used to be just kind of automatic. You went from 28, then when you went to 16, and then you went to 12, and then you went to \u2013 just people you just, sort of was like, you just jump. And I think it's each of these is going to have their place in terms of the application set that they serve. So, we're well-positioned really well on both. But certainly for 3-nanometer, we're in the middle of some pretty exciting discussions across almost all of our major end markets. Thanks, Harlan. I think we \u2013 maybe a couple more questions, and then we'll wrap it. Totally. Yes, let me answer both and if Willem wants to jump in on the second one at the end, he can. On the first one, yes, I wouldn't really read too much into this one, Matt. The way to think about how that consumer storage business has evolved is, it's a limited number of products. They're really customized designs, I would say. And I wouldn't \u2013 I think somebody earlier you may have been going through [security as this] [ph] we basically said, hey, just sort of assume the first half, Q1 plus Q2, kind of average that out, that's probably where that \u2013 there's a little bit of lumpiness. We were down in Q1. It's kind of going back up in Q2. But if you look at that, half over half, it should be down in the second half and over time, consumer for us will just trend down, kind of in-line with our Investor Day model. So, I wouldn't \u2013 I would not sort of assume that, that just keeps going. I would take a very kind of conservative view on our consumer business. And if it does better, that would be great. We just sort of bank it, put it away and cash the check. But it's not something we put a lot of R&D to in anymore. These are designs from some time ago, and there's a little bit of just a funky Q1, Q2 dynamic on the demand. So, I wouldn't read too much into that. I'm glad you asked on the OpEx. Let me just give you my take and Willem can chime in. So, when \u2013 look, we do our annual strategic plan in Marvell usually every August, kind of September. And so, we did that last year. And between now and then, the world has really changed. It's changed in terms of the market dynamics, what's happening with some of our major customers. The macro economy is different. Interest rates are different. You name it, right? It's sort of summer of last year versus now. And so, we're always very thoughtful about how we think about our R&D and capital allocation. I mean, in my mind, it's the most important thing, Matt, that we do, okay? That lever is really going to be our future or not. And things have changed. And so, we did a very extensive review last quarter, very methodically of all the programs in flight by business unit, by product line, looked at how they compare to what our original estimates were for our estimates, at least the last time we posted it. And we made a number of decisions on some programs where the sponsorship really wasn't there or the customer they were wavering or their plans changed. And at the same time, you've got this inflection where huge surge in demand for AI type of things, optics, you name it. And so, we've done some pretty aggressive repositioning in terms of our spending footprint. And so, we're able to exit the year in a lower OpEx footprint than we're running today, but it's still at an incredibly healthy level. I mean, we're spending more as a percent of R&D than almost all of our peers of, sort of similar or even larger size. We've allocated more R&D to some of the key areas where we see just a lot of activity and growth. In some cases, we've rightsized certain product groups that maybe their new reality is different. Maybe it's a legacy business. It's running at a lower level than it was before. We're just sort of dealing with that on an individual group by individual group basis. And then in some cases, we're just getting more efficiency. I mean as an example, we took our processor business unit and our custom ASIC group. And over time, those two teams end up, kind of at the same customer, they end up sharing IP. We're in all the joint meetings together. And so, Raghib Hussain made the decision, which I think is spot-on, which was to combine those into a single organization. And when you do that, you typically get some efficiency savings. So, I feel very confident in the OpEx profile of the company exiting the year. I think it's appropriate for the conditions we're in. The growth areas are getting more and we're just being very judicious about how we do it. And quite frankly, we had a lot of [growth there] [ph]. We acquired a couple of companies over the last few years. Marvell effectively doubled, right, kind of from pre-pandemic to now in terms of revenues. And so, there was just an opportunity really to go through, kind of systematically and look at what do we need to run this company and run it with compelling financials with a setup for next year with that, sort of OpEx profile and spending level to really enable a tremendous drop through to the bottom line as we get leverage in some of these new design wins kicking in. And so, look, we're going to keep evaluating all the opportunities on a systematic basis. And as our revenues improve and as we see the growth ahead, we'll layer back in, in a thoughtful way. But right now, take kind of the Q4 exit rate that Willem talked about. There'll be some normal step-up in Q1, which would really be just normal payroll tax and merit. And then that's probably, kind of where we hang out for the first half of next year, at least at this time.  Again, if things change and revenues going gangbusters and something we'll look at it, but we're sort of set-up right now to have a very strong flow through, drop through next year and have not sacrificed any growth opportunities. Long answer, but I did want to cover it for the whole investor team out there. That's the last question, yeah. Sure. Yes, great questions. And I think we've got a very, kind of practical view on these, Srini. So, on enterprise, I think you indicated in your part of your question, I mean, this actually business is really outperformed relative to the expectations we set at our Investor Day in 2021. Lot of great progress on share gains, content gains as things like multi-gig ramped up, we added things like new custom ASICs. So, that business has sort of outperformed, but it's outperformed because the market was good, but also really because of our own doing. And so, we've been saying for some time, it's going to correct.  It did better than we thought in Q1, but it will come down in Q2. And yes, I think that environment you've sort of got is correct. But I think of enterprise, at least now it's kind of at least if you look at it year-on-year from last year, this year or next year, it's kind of flattish. We've got \u2013 even if there's some \u2013 there'll be quarters where it's down more. But if you, sort of normalize it, there'll be \u2013 we still have, sort of a strong story underneath, if you will. But we're not saying it's a grower for sure, and there'll be a couple of quarters or however long it takes to do some inventory clearing. I think you're right on overall carrier, especially on 5G. There's been very robust deployments worldwide. You still got things like India, which are happening this year, and there'll be more other regions next year. But I do think that overall, the market side will probably move down. At the same time, we still have content gains in front of us. So, that's a little bit of an offset. There's still at least one kind of bigger socket that still hasn't ramped. So, I think our content story is still pretty good in 5G. But look, we've got pretty good visibility through the third quarter of this year, after that, we do think it's going to drop in Q4, and then where it ends up next year is, kind of a little bit early, but I'd say, at some point, we have content that layers in there, too. So, hopefully, that's helpful to kind of paint a picture, but we're not pounding the table that these are going to be continued growth drivers into 2025. We're actually modeling. And then something like wired, we're modeling it to still stay pretty weak in telecom for some time. So, there's some puts and takes, obviously, in the overall business. With that I think we could wrap it. A lot of questions, I know. But we want to make sure we answered them all. We appreciate everybody's participation today. I look forward to the call backs and talking to everybody afterwards. So, thanks very much, everybody."
